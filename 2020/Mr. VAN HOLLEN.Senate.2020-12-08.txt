 Madam President, I want to start by thanking my  friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Maryland, Senator Ben  Cardin, for his remembrance of Paul Sarbanes. I am honored to join him  and others in offering a resolution in memory of Senator Paul Sarbanes.   I should say that Senator Sarbanes was very pleased that Ben Cardin  succeeded him in his seat here in the U.S. Senate. So I am honored to  join with him, Senator Stabenow, Senator Reed, Senator Durbin, and  others in remembering somebody who was a friend, who was a mentor, and  who was the excellent role model for every elected official--Senator  Paul Sarbanes.   He was a thoughtful and brilliant Senator, a kind man, and a  dedicated public servant. As we have heard, he was born on Maryland's  Eastern Shore to parents who emigrated from Greece. He graduated from  the local public high school, Wicomico High School, and was recruited  to attend Princeton on a full scholarship. He excelled in his studies  as he would in his career, becoming a Rhodes scholar and graduating  from Oxford before attending Harvard Law School.   He went on to a very distinguished career in public service that  ended here in the U.S. Senate, but he never ever forgot his humble  roots in Salisbury, where his parents owned a small restaurant they  called the Mayflower.   In his farewell speech in the Senate, Senator Paul Sarbanes said:         My parents came to this country as immigrants from Greece,       both my mother and [my] father, and it was from them that I       first learned about the meaning of a democratic society and       the potential it offers to move up the ladder of opportunity       on the basis of ability, hard work, and conviction. Their       memory is still a very powerful influence in my life.    As we heard from Senator Cardin, Senator Barbara Mikulski, who served  here so well, was his friend and partner, and for years she always  joked that they were the ``Diner Democrats,'' a nod to the Mayflower  restaurant, owned by Paul Sarbanes's father, her roots in the Polish- American community in Baltimore, and their mutual commitment to  fighting for working people, for the dignity of work, for the reality  of the struggles so many Americans face, and the need to give every  American a fair shot.   Paul Sarbanes carried the values he learned from his parents on  Maryland's Eastern Shore, first to the Maryland House of Delegates,  then to the House of Representatives, and later here to the U.S.  Senate.   From the very start, he developed a reputation for thoughtfulness and  honor. He could make simple and confident arguments, based on evidence,  to win others to his cause--Members from both parties.   He was in his first term in the House of Representatives during the  Watergate hearings, and he approached the proceedings on the Judiciary  Committee with his signature seriousness of purpose. He considered the  evidence, he listened to President Nixon's counsel's statements, and  methodically addressed and responded to their arguments. Because of his  own unimpeachable conduct, the chairman of the House Judiciary  Committee called upon him, a new member, and asked him to introduce the  first article of impeachment against President Nixon--the charge of  obstruction of justice. Paul Sarbanes had the legal acumen to take on  that responsibility, but he also had the integrity to be a moral voice  in the Congress at that moment for the country.   Writing about his dignified work during the Watergate proceedings,  journalist Elizabeth Drew commented: ``Paul Sarbanes would not have  looked at all bad at the Constitutional Convention; he might have  [even] been one of the great ones.''   After three terms in the House, Paul Sarbanes ran for the Senate. I  first met Senator Sarbanes in the 1980s, when I was serving as a staff  member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   I know everybody who served with Paul Sarbanes will understand what a  master class it was to watch him during a hearing. On cross- examination,  [[Page S7272]]  he asked thoughtful, probing questions, and before a reluctant witness  realized what was happening, he had them cornered with no way out but  to concede to the point that he wanted to make or look deliberately  evasive. Woe be it to any witness who came before Senator Sarbanes  unprepared.   He was a Senate workhorse in the truest and best sense. Former  Majority Leader George Mitchell once said: ``Paul was effective because  he didn't seek credit, which endeared him to his colleagues.''   He wasn't afraid to take his time to get to the bottom of an issue,  build his case, and convince his colleagues. In the wake of the Enron  scandal, he held 10 hearings to ensure that the congressional response  would be thorough and effective and rallied the entire Senate to  support the ensuing Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the law that is credited with  restoring greater investor confidence in the market and providing  transparency and oversight for corporate governance.   He loved the State of Maryland, and especially the Chesapeake Bay. As  Senator Cardin indicated, he took on the mantle of forging and  strengthening the Federal partnership to clean up his beloved  Chesapeake Bay.   He wanted everybody to have a fair deal and worked to improve access  to affordable housing and to protect consumers from his seat on the  Banking Committee. He believed in the United States as a force for good  in the world and supported foreign assistance, the treaties to return  control of the Panama Canal to Panama, and strongly supported  legislation to impose sanctions under the then-apartheid regime of  South Africa. He opposed senseless and unnecessary wars.   I came to the House of Representatives in 2003, along with my friend  and colleague from Baltimore, Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger. Senator  Sarbanes was then the leader of our delegation. He welcomed us kindly,  but as captain of Team Maryland, he characteristically was eager to  allow all Members, however new they were to the delegation, to play an  important role.   Not surprisingly, Senator Sarbanes was a favored son of the Greek- American community. He was a member of the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of  the Annunciation in Baltimore and held the highest lay office in the  church. We shared strong bonds in the Greek-American community because,  like Paul's parents, my wife Katherine's mother's family immigrated  from Greece.   As a strong believer in promoting democratic values at home and  abroad, Senator Sarbanes was proud of those Greek roots and spoke often  of democracy's roots with the ancient Greeks. He used to speak to  students about the importance of public service, telling them that in  ancient Athens, people who lived only a private life, without view of  the public good, were failing to live fully.   Indeed, the power of democracy and its promise of opportunity was the  driving force behind his governing philosophy--to open the door to  others, to keep your promises, and to achieve based on your merit, not  on your connections, money, or power.   As extraordinary a public servant as he was, Paul Sarbanes was, above  all, a family man. He was devoted to his wife Christine, whom he met at  Oxford. Recalling their first encounter, Paul said:         She came to a meeting of the American Association I headed.       I forgot what was on the agenda. All I remember of that       meeting was that was where I met Christine.    She was brilliant and kind, an educator in Latin, Greek, French, and  the classics, who matched Senator Sarbanes's intelligence and shared  his love of service. They used to knock on doors together during his  political campaigns, and she was a sounding board throughout his  career. They raised three children, including our friend,   John  Sarbanes, who now serves Maryland so well in the House of  Representatives. He was enormously proud of them and his seven  grandchildren.   I also extend my condolences today to Senator Sarbanes's former  staff. His legacy goes well beyond the laws he wrote to the way he  worked. He shared with them: Do your homework, understand the details,  act with integrity, and hold firm to your values. It is an example for  all of us to follow.   Senator Sarbanes was not a flashy presence. In fact, political  opponents once tried to belittle him with the name ``the stealth  Senator.'' But as he joked, stealth ``is one of the most important  weapons in our military arsenal. . . . if you let somebody else take  the credit, you can get the result.''   That was Paul Sarbanes--enormous accomplishments, never taking the  credit. His quiet confidence left an impression on all who served with  him.   We have lost a great Senator. America has lost a great Senator, and  many of us have lost a very good friend. But we should be comforted in  the knowledge that he achieved what we would all wish for ourselves: He  served well, he made the world better for others, he treated all he  knew with respect and earned their respect in return, and he leaves us  with fond memories.   May God grant those who loved him the strength to bear his loss, and  may his memory be eternal.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I am honored to thank and congratulate  one of my constituents and one of the Federal Government's unsung  heroes, David E. ``Dave'' Benor, who is retiring on January 3, 2021,  after more than 48 years of service as a public health attorney at the  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the General  Counsel, HHS-OGC.   After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1972, Mr. Benor began his  career at HHS-OGC and never left, rising to positions of increasing  responsibility throughout the years. Since 2004, he has served as the  Associate General Counsel for Public Health. In this leadership role,  he has led HHS-OGC's Public Health Division, a 100-person office within  HHS-OGC that provides legal services to the Assistant Secretary for  Health, the Surgeon General, and multiple agencies that comprise the  Public Health Service, including the National Institutes of Health, the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Indian Health Service,  the Health Services and Resources Administration, the Substance Abuse  and Mental Health Services Administration, and the Agency for  Healthcare Research and Quality. Mr. Benor has worked extensively on  product liability, grant law, organ transplant, and vaccine issues, and  has particular expertise with the Public Health Service safety net  programs, in public health emergency response issues, and in  implementing regulatory and compensation programs.   Mr. Benor has dedicated his entire career to implementing HHS's  mission to advance the health of all people. He has done this by  providing authoritative legal advice on major health initiatives,  including those related to bioterrorism preparedness, biomedical  research, organ transplantation, vaccine development and liability, and  the provision of healthcare to medically underserved populations  through such programs as the community health center program, the Ryan  White HIV/ AIDS Program, and maternal and child health grants. He has  been a key legal adviser on the Department's international health  initiatives, including Afghan and Iraqi reconstruction, global AIDS  programs, and quarantine activities for diseases such as SARS, pandemic  influenza, and monkey pox, and has been part of multidisciplinary teams  working on the public health response to the War on Terrorism,  including the response to anthrax attacks, smallpox vaccine  development, COVID-19, and pharmaceutical stockpile development.   Mr. Benor has received numerous awards throughout his career. In  2012, President Barack Obama awarded Mr. Benor the Presidential Rank  Award of Meritorious Executive, one of the highest awards that a career  Senior Executive Service member may receive.   Dave Benor's impact on public health will be felt for years to come  both through his work on a wide variety of public health programs and  by the inspiring example he has provided for the many attorneys with  whom he worked and mentored. I was pleased to have a flag flown over  the U.S. Capitol over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend as a symbol of  our Nation's thanks to this outstanding public servant.   I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Dave Benor for  his distinguished service to our country and to wish him all the best  in the coming years as he enjoys his well-earned retirement.                            ____________________
