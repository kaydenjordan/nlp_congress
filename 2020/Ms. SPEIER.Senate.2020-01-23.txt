 Colonel Vindman, you are the National Security       Council's director for Ukraine. Did you participate in       preparing the talking points for the President's call?        VINDMAN. I did. I prepared them.         So you prepared them. They were then reviewed       and edited by multiple senior officers at the NSC and the       White House. Is that correct?        VINDMAN. That is correct.         Did the talking points for the president       contain any discussion of investigations into the 2016       election, the Bidens or Burisma?        VINDMAN. They did not.         Are you aware of any written product from the       National Security Council suggesting that investigations into       the 2016 election, the Bidens, or Burisma are part of the       official policy of the United States?        VINDMAN. No, I'm not.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Dr. Hill also elaborated on this point.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Dr. HILL. My point, Mr. Nunes, is that we at the National       Security Council were not told either by the President       directly or through Ambassador Bolton that we were to be       focused on these issues as a matter of U.S. foreign policy       towards Ukraine. So when we are talking about Ukraine in       2016, I never personally heard the President say anything       specific about 2016 and Ukraine. I've seen him say plenty of       things publicly, but I was not given a directive. In fact, I       was given a directive by Ambassador Bolton on July 10 very       clearly to stay out of domestic politics.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. So, to be clear, when President Trump asked for  these investigations, he was not asking for them based on an official  U.S. policy. His top official advisers had not even been told about  these investigations. To the contrary, they were told to stay out of  U.S. politics.   And it gets worse. It was not just that President Trump ignored  official U.S. policy and the talking points he was given; it was that  what he was doing--withholding support from Ukraine--was actually  contrary to and harmful to U.S. policy.   There is clear and undisputed bipartisan support for Ukraine. Ukraine  is our ally. What is more, they are at war with our adversary, Russia.  So our goal should be to help President Zelensky's anti-corruption  reforms and to help Ukraine fight its adversary, Russia, in any way  that we can.   President Trump's own national defense strategy stated that the  United States and its European allies ``will deter Russian  adventurism''--a clear reference to Russia's usurpation of Ukrainian  territory and sovereignty. Consistent with that strategy, we currently  have approximately 68,000 troops stationed in Europe. Roughly 10,000 of  those U.S. troops are deployed on NATO's eastern border with Russia, to  countries like Poland, Hungary, Lithuania, and Bulgaria. These American  forces are literally holding the line against another land grab by  Vladimir Putin.   The author of that strategy, former U.S. National Security Advisor  LTG H.R. McMaster, issued this stark warning about Russia's aggression:         [F]or too long, some nations have looked the other way in       the face of these threats. Russia brazenly and implausibly       denies its actions and we have failed to impose sufficient       costs. The Kremlin's confidence is growing as its agents       conduct their sustained campaigns to undermine our confidence       in ourselves and in one another.    What General McMaster says obviously makes sense. Russia's  confidence, sadly, is growing. We need to stand up to them, and that is  why we support Ukraine, to help defeat Russian aggression.   So, on July 25, when President Zelensky spoke with President Trump,  that is what he, McMaster, was hoping to discuss--or he would be hoping  that he would discuss how we can support Ukraine in its fight against a  huge adversary.   Our confidence in one another; that is what President Zelensky was  most worried about when he got on the line with the President on July  25, whether Ukraine could have confidence in U.S. support.   Nearly 70 percent of Ukraine's territory--I am sorry. Nearly 7  percent of Ukraine's territory had been annexed by Russian-backed  forces. More than 15,000 troops have been lost in the hot war over the  past 5 years.   But when President Zelensky raised the issue of U.S. military aid  needed to confront Russian aggression, President Trump did nothing to  reassure the Ukrainian leader of our steadfast support for Ukraine's  sovereignty. Instead, he made personal demands.   It is for these reasons that President Trump's investigations went  against official U.S. policy. Witnesses confirmed that President  Trump's requests actually diverged not just from our policy but from  our own national security.   As Dr. Hill testified, Ambassador Sondland, in carrying out President  Trump's scheme, ``was being involved in a domestic political errand,  and we were being involved in national security policy, and those two  things had just diverged.''   And as Ambassador Taylor elaborated, ``[O]ur holding up of security  assistance that would go to a country that is fighting aggression from  Russia, for no good policy reason, no good substantive reason, no good  national security reason, is wrong.''   As these officials so correctly observed, there is no question that  President Trump's political errand and our national security diverged;  that he did this to advance his reelection, not to advance U.S.  national security goals, and that he did it for no good reason but the  political one.   But it is more than that. It is more than our national security  policy. We, as a country, are meant to embody the solution to  corruption. Our country is based on promoting the rule of law. And  here, what the President did attacks another of the U.S. strengths,  that of our ideals and our values.   Part of that is ensuring the integrity of our democracy and our  political institutions. It is a fundamental American value underlying  our democracy that we do not use official powers to ask for  investigations of our political opponents to gain a political  advantage.   When President Trump asked a foreign leader to investigate his  political opponent, he abused the broad authority provided to the  President of the United States.   Witness testimony again confirms this. Vice President Pence's  adviser, Jennifer Williams, was concerned by the President's focus on  domestic political issues rather than U.S. national security because  the President is not supposed to use foreign governments for political  errands.   She characterized the call as ``a domestic political matter.'' Here  is her testimony:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Jennifer WILLIAMS. During my closed-door deposition,       members of the committee asked about my personal views, and       whether  [[Page S502]]       I had any concerns about the July 25th call. As I testified       then, I found the July 25th phone call unusual because, in       contrast to other Presidential calls I had observed, it       involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic       political matter.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman also thought the call  was improper and unrelated to the talking points he had drafted for the  President.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Lt. Col. VINDMAN. It is improper for the President of the       United States to demand that a foreign government investigate       a U.S. citizen, and a political opponent . . .--it was also       clear that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the 2016       elections, the Bidens and Burisma, it would be interpreted as       a partisan play. This would undoubtedly result in Ukraine       using bipartisan support, undermining U.S. national security,       and advancing Russia's strategic objectives in the region.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, as a reminder, is a  Purple Heart veteran and says what we all know clearly: It is improper  for the President of the United States to demand a foreign government  to investigate a U.S. citizen and a political opponent.   And it wasn't just that Colonel Vindman thought it was wrong; he was  so concerned that he warned Ukraine, too, not to get involved in our  domestic politics.   In May, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman grew concerned by the pressure  campaign he witnessed in the media, waged primarily by Rudy Giuliani.  During a meeting with President Zelensky on May 20, Lieutenant Colonel  Vindman warned the Ukrainian leader to stay out of U.S. politics-- because that is our official U.S. policy.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Lieutenant Colonel VINDMAN. During a bilateral meeting in       which the whole delegation was meeting with President       Zelensky and his team, I offered two pieces of advice: To be       particularly cautious with regards to Ukraine--to be       particularly cautious with regards to Russia, and its desire       to provoke Ukraine; and the second one was to stay out of       U.S. domestic policy.
