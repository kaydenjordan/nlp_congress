 Mr. President, if I told you that a cabal of wealthy  elites and special interests were spinning a web of deceit to lie to  the American people and to rig the levers of power in their favor, you  would think I was talking about the plot of some movie, some TV show,  or some novel. But, as Senator Whitehouse and several of our colleagues  have come to the floor to demonstrate this past week, this isn't about  the plot of a movie; this is real life that it is happening here right  now, and it is important that we as Americans and we as Members of the  Senate face it squarely and understand how this manipulation is being  designed to take our ``we the people'' Constitution and turn it on its  head--turn it into a government of, by, and for the powerful rather  than of, by, and for the people.   Today, I am going to share with you a little bit of information about  one piece of this web of deceit, and that is the Heritage Foundation.  It is a well-known name here in Washington after decades of engaging in  a mission of formulating and promoting rightwing public policies.  People hear ``Heritage Foundation,'' and they know what it is.   As Jane Mayer writes in her book ``Dark Money,'' it was created to be  ``purposefully political, priding itself on creating, selling, and  injecting conservative ideas into the American mainstream.'' Well, that  is a more complicated way of saying that it was created to be an  advocate for the fossil fuel industry and to mislead Americans in every  possible way in order for them to continue their deeply damaging and  polluting ways. Ms. Mayer goes on to describe the organization as a  ``political weapon'' disguised as a think tank, and that pretty much  sums it up.   One of the organization's founders, Paul Weyrich, once said about  solidifying power for the biggest corporations and wealthiest  Americans:         I don't want everybody to vote. . . . As a matter of fact,       our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the       voting populace goes down.''    Thus there is this intense support to engage in voter suppression. If  you are a red-blooded American, you believe in the vision of voter  empowerment, not voter suppression. So that says a lot about what this  organization is all about. It is not we the people, it is not voters  empowerment but rigging this Nation and this process for the powerful  and the privileged.    The papers, reports, and journals that come from the Heritage  Foundation work to muddy the water on established science. I did find  it interesting that every now and then they promote an idea that  actually makes some sense. Back in 1989 they promoted, in a publication  entitled ``Ensuring Affordable Healthcare for all Americans,'' a plan  to establish a marketplace with tax credits to enable people to be able  to help buy policies. This was the foundation for RomneyCare in  Massachusetts, and it became the foundation then for the Affordable  Care Act.   In fact, back then, long before the Affordable Care Act came along,  people like House Speaker Newt Gingrich, whenever he talked about the  possibility of improving government healthcare, he talked about the  Heritage Foundation's plan for a marketplace, but the moment an  administration came along that happened to be a Democratic  administration that took that idea seriously, the Heritage Foundation  immediately abandoned it, which goes to my point that they are engaged  directly in the game of politics on behalf of the Koch brothers' cabal  and sabotaging, in a partisan and political way, the blue team at any  possible moment.   In one brief, Heritage explained away their change of heart saying:  ``Analysts once supported a limited and qualified insurance mandate''  but now believed it was ``bad public policy'' because the mandate came  from the Heritage Foundation.   In 2012, Stuart Butler, the Heritage Foundation researcher who  authored the original publication calling for an individual mandate,  wrote an op-ed saying he had changed his mind, and he titled it,  ``Don't blame Heritage for `ObamaCare' mandate.''   Well, why not? They put the idea forward. It actually was a key  principle of insurance marketplaces, otherwise you created an insurance  death cycle. So they put the idea forward. They promoted the  marketplace. They said this  [[Page S2462]]  is what is necessary, and then they abandoned it, when it was  advantageous, to a partisan, political attack.   In fact, the then-president, former Senator Jim DeMint, went out in  2013 on a multi-State tour to basically drive up support for stopping  the very idea that Heritage had initiated.   They certainly have gone out of their way in this effort for voter  suppression, which is a complete affront to the most fundamental and  basic right of our Nation. In reports, they make claims like ``there is  no credible evidence that voter-ID laws have impeded turnout,  especially among minorities and Democrats, as their opponents  suggest.''   Well, of course, the exact opposite is true.   In regard to North Carolina, they said that ``there has been no  `suppression' of the turnout of North Carolina voters by any of these  reform measures.''   OK. Not true. In fact, it was exactly the intent of impeding the  turnout that was debated in the North Carolina Legislature. That was  the heart of why they undertook it.   In fact, when the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reviewed it, they  described it as ``almost surgical precision'' in the way it was  targeted at suppressing the vote by minority voters. The U.S. Supreme  Court reviewed it and they refused to hear a case appealing the lower  court's ruling.   Then there is the real heart of this web of deceit; that is, the  Heritage Foundation's decades of efforts to say that carbon dioxide  pollution is just fine, don't worry.   I think about how back in 1959, Edward Teller was addressing the 100- year anniversary of the oil industry. They invited him to speak, as an  eminent scientist, and he said many good things about the role that  burning fossil fuels could do to amplify the energy in America, but he  also said there are two challenges this industry has. The first  challenge is that there is a limited amount of fossil fuels in the  ground and someday we will run up against that shortfall and we will  have to switch to other forms of energy. It turned out there was a lot  more fossil fuels around the planet than we ever anticipated in 1959.   The second point he made was, you know, this may not seem like a  pollutant because you can't smell it--this carbon dioxide--you can't  see it, but it has the intriguing and problematic characteristic in  that carbon dioxide traps heat. It traps infrared energy. As a  consequence, it is going to cause great disturbances as it builds up in  the atmosphere. He specifically talked about its effect on the Poles in  raising temperatures, melting ice, and raising sea levels.   Today we know it has many more impacts that Teller didn't elaborate  on back in 1959 but come from this warming impact. We have seen global  temperatures reach a record year after year after year, with some 17 of  the hottest years occurring in the last 18 years, which is a phenomenal  indication of the direction we are headed.   When I was running for office, a billion baby oysters died in Oregon  at a hatchery not because of a virus but because the acidity of the  water had grown 30 percent over the course of the Industrial Revolution  burning fossil fuels. How is that connected? It is because burning the  fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide. The wave action takes that carbon  dioxide and turns it into carbonic acid, and now we have a massive flow  of acid into the oceans--enough to change its acidity level by 30  percent, enough to kill baby oysters because it is so difficult to  start extracting the chemicals for a shell out of the water when the  acidic level is so much higher.   We have seen the impact on our coral reefs--the ocean acidity  combined with the temperature of the ocean. As many already understand,  coral is an animal that lives in a symbiotic relationship with algae.  When the temperature of the ocean gets warmer, the algae overwhelms the  coral, the coral expels it and basically commits suicide. It is called  bleaching. They throw the symbiotic algae out, and then the coral dies,  and the acidity adds to that difficulty of the coral forming the coral  structure itself.    Lastly, we were sent a huge message by Mother Nature. Remember,  Harvey and Irma and Maria, three dramatic hurricanes all hitting the  United States of America. Why did they carry so much punch? They  carried it because 90 percent of the heat that is trapped by global  warming is trapped in the ocean, and that greater energy in the ocean  then produces stronger hurricanes.   If that wasn't enough, we had those raging forest fires from Montana  on through to the northwest corner of Washington State, down through  Oregon, deep into California and way late in the season, clear to  December--a much longer season. Many acres burned in those fierce  fires.   So whether it was hurricanes or raging forest fires, Mother Nature is  trying to say something is dramatically wrong, and you better act.   The Heritage Foundation is there for political purposes. They are  there to do the Koch brothers' bidding. So their purpose is to sow  doubt, mislead Americans. It is like the tobacco industry misleading  Americans about the fact that smoking cigarettes causes cancer. In the  course of their greed, they are damaging the world in a colossal way,  and we have to call them out. We have to strip away their pretense to  be serious about policy and know what it is all about: the greed of the  fossil fuel industry for short-term profits while deeply damaging this  beautiful, blue-green planet that we have the responsibility to  protect.   They said climate change is ``a potentially serious issue'' that  ``might cause problems in the future, but the impacts cannot be  determined with any degree of certainty.''   What a colossal lie. It is not ``potential.'' It is here now. It is  not ``might cause problems.'' It is causing problems. Scientists do  measure it in all kinds of ways. They measure it with a thermometer  when they measure the temperature of the air and water. They measure it  with a yardstick when they measure the oceans, and they measure it with  the movement of insects and animals that we see all throughout our  Nation, from the spread of diseases like Zika to the spread of  challenges like the pine beetle in the Northwest and the ticks in the  Northeast. They blatantly distort and misrepresent the truth.   They did this on a Royal Society's statement on climate. They edited  it to change a powerful statement about the problem into one that casts  doubt on the issue. They just did this.   Now, let me explain that this is not--the Royal Society is not just  any organization; this is the United Kingdom's national science academy  and a fellowship of the world's most eminent scientists. It has been  around since the 1660s, bringing scientific facts to policy debates. It  included Sir Isaac Newton. It included Charles Darwin. It included  Albert Einstein. It included Benjamin Franklin. It included the late  Stephen Hawking.   In 2010, the Heritage fellow, who happened to be a former Koch  Foundation associate, just coincidentally, posted a blog on the  foundation's site entitled ``U.S. Could Learn from U.K.'s Global  Warming Reversal.'' The very title is saying the opposite of what the  actual document said. It commented on this blog on a ``dramatic  reversal'' of the Royal Society on climate, but the blog cut and pasted  parts of the report to make it say the opposite of what it actually  said. So 10 pages, 48 paragraphs, that laid out the impact of climate  chaos were edited out in order to mischaracterize the Royal Society's  conclusions.   This is the type of truth-bending, misrepresentation, and outright  lies the Heritage Foundation is involved in on behalf of the Koch  brothers. The report summary even said the report ``shows that there is  strong evidence''--this is the actual report, not the blog--``strong  evidence of Earth's warming caused by human activity.''   The Heritage Foundation proceeds to say things like the ``hysteria  over global warming is now pervasive in the federal government.''   They say ``hysteria'' because they want to dismiss it as some  emotional response rather than the conclusion of virtually the entire  scientific community. Every major scientific organization in the world  weighing in on why it is they want to rein in EPA's regulatory  excesses, what they say are--this is what they say: We want to rein in  ``EPA's regulatory excesses with respect to carbon dioxide and other  greenhouse-gas emissions'' and that the reining-in is ``long overdue.''  [[Page S2463]]    They go on to say: ``Congress should insist on preventing . . .  regulators from mandating greenhouse-gas-emissions caps, or from using  greenhouse-gas emissions as a means to promulgate a rule.''   In other words, what they are saying is, we are misconstruing the  science, outright lying to the American people, to prevent Congress  from responding to this dramatic impact on our country--not just on our  country but on the world.   They also proceed to misrepresent a lot of information about the  impacts of oil drilling. There is a 1985 piece in Heritage Today  entitled ``Offshore Oil Drilling: Good for the Economy. Great for the  fish.'' According to the article, the fears of proponents of the ban on  offshore drilling that ``another disaster like the Santa Barbara  Channel spill in 1969, when [up to] two-million gallons of sepia- colored oil bubbled up from the ocean floor, covering hundreds of  square miles of sea'' were not justified.   Fears about another disaster were not justified. Why? They said  because ``offshore oil and gas production is carefully regulated.''   It went on to say that ``every offshore operation must include three  blow-out preventers and casings for drills; drills must be cemented  into the surrounding earth.''   Then they said: ``Oil companies must submit an oil spill contingency  plan'' and ``frequent safety inspections, scheduled and unscheduled,  further reduce the risk of spills.''   Tell that to the crew of the Deepwater Horizon, because what we  learned when we investigated what happened with Deepwater Horizon and  what happened at other drilling platforms all around the gulf was the  exact opposite of what the Heritage Foundation put forward on behalf of  the Koch brothers and the fossil fuel business. What we really found  out is that the blowout preventers were poorly designed. They failed.  An explosion sunk the rig, and a sea floor gusher flowed for 87 days, 3  months.   The Associated Press found that in the lead-up to the accident,  Deepwater Horizon wasn't carefully regulated. It said a quarter of the  required inspections were never carried out. It said the rig ``was  allowed to operate without safety documentation'' that was required;  that they had received five or six safety citations, the most serious  of which occurred in 2002, ``when the rig was shut down because  required pressure tests had not been conducted on the blowout  preventer--the device that was supposed to stop oil from gushing out''  if things went wrong.   The gulf coast is still trying to recover from this disaster: 4 to 8  billion harvestable oysters killed; 51,000 to 84,000 birds killed;  56,000 to 166,000 sea turtles killed; a 51-percent decrease in the  dolphin population; an estimated $2 trillion to $5 trillion of newly  hatched fish killed. The list goes on and on, hardly the vision the  Heritage Foundation wanted to put forward.   So how does this web of deceit work? Just follow the money. Since  1998, they have received a huge amount of support from the fossil fuel  industry--$780,000 just from one company, ExxonMobil. Over the course  of a number of years, the Koch Foundation gave more than $5.7 million  to fund their work. There was an additional nearly $5 million received  from the Claude R. Lambe Foundation, which happens to be one of the  Koch Family Foundations. Heritage is also a member of the State Policy  Network, a web of rightwing think tanks across the country that the  Koch brothers own. Koch money is coming from every direction. Heritage  Foundation is the puppet of the Koch cartel enterprise.   That is only the tip of the iceberg of how this system works. We can  trace back all of these pieces to the fossil fuel efforts to mislead  the American public, to lie to the American public, and to spread doubt  about actual scientific work.   We see their connections all through the Trump administration. When  the Koch brothers say jump, the President of the United States says:  How high? Then he does whatever they ask. If they want Scott Pruitt as  head of the EPA, that is who they are going to get. If they want the  Congressman whom they have championed throughout his entire career to  be our chief diplomat, that is what they get.    Mr. President, if I can wrap up in two sentences, I will  say that this web of deceit is enormously damaging to our Nation. Let's  call it out. Let's have an actual debate based on the science and not  let the Koch brothers do what the tobacco industry did and mislead the  American public decade after decade after decade to the great damage of  the citizens of this great country.    Madam President, Oregon is renowned for our  beautiful places, and the view of the Columbia Gorge from Interstate 84  is one of the most stunning drives in the country. Oregonians and  travelers alike are fortunate that, for a century now, we have been  able to break from driving and take in the entire stunning view of the  gorge from the Vista House.   The idea came from Samuel Lancaster, supervisor of the Columbia River  Highway project, who proposed to construct a building on the summit of  Crown Point. He wanted travelers along the highway to feel inspired,  and to make the wonders of the gorge accessible.   The Vista House was built as a rest stop observatory on the old  Columbia River Gorge Highway and as a memorial for Oregon's settlers,  particularly those whose journey took them along the Columbia River.  Described by its architect, Edgar M. Lazarus, as ``a temple to the  natural beauty of the Gorge,'' Vista House has long been recognized for  its historic significance and was listed in the National Register of  Historic Places in 1974.   From its vantage point 733 feet above the Columbia River, millions of  travelers have enjoyed a step back in time and one of Oregon's most  inspiring views. With the help of thousands of dedicated volunteers  from Friends of Vista House, who tell visitors the fascinating history  of the Vista House, this Oregon treasure has found its place in our  Nation's history.   I join all Oregonians in looking forward to another 100 years of  celebrating Oregon's beauty and its history at the Vista House.                            ____________________
