 Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend, chairman of the  Foreign Affairs Committee; and my good friend, the ranking member of  the Foreign Affairs Committee, for their generous remarks, for their  leadership, and for bringing yet again a bipartisan bill to the floor  of the House, which many people think we can't do, but we, in fact, do  do.   I also want to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), my good  friend, for being my partner in this legislation for 3 years now.   Our legislation, the Global Health Security Act, reaffirms the United  States' commitment to promoting global health security.   Prior to COVID-19, there was a dearth of leadership and strategy  around U.S. planning for a global health security emergency. Now, as we  start to emerge from the worst of the pandemic, we understand just how  important planning is.   COVID-19 has underscored not only the need for a robust Federal  response, but also the importance of investing in global health  security and pandemic preparedness throughout the world. Diseases do  not stop at national borders.   I am honored and pleased the House Foreign Affairs Committee has  coalesced around this legislation, which offers a bipartisan solution  that addresses deficiencies in the current pandemic response effort. It  also demonstrates, I think, a commitment to a comprehensive and  sustainable approach to global health security moving forward.   The bill establishes a Global Health Security Agenda Interagency  Review Council overseen by a National Security Advisor, whose  membership includes the heads of agencies relevant to carrying out the  Global Health Security Agenda.   It establishes a U.S. Coordinator for Global Health Security  responsible for coordinating interagency responses.   It requires the President to develop a global health security  strategy with specific and measurable goals, benchmarks, and  performance metrics to improve U.S. leadership on global pandemic  preparedness.   Finally, it establishes an international Fund for Global Health  Security and Pandemic Preparedness.   Mr. Speaker, I also appreciate both Chairman Meeks' and Ranking  Member McCaul's willingness to work to strengthen this bill as it  passed through the committee during our markup. We made improvements,  with their suggestion, in elevating the participants of the interagency  review council in a manner commensurate with the scope of the work. We  strengthened the scope of the global health security strategy with  lessons learned; and we added a multilateral Federal fund.   These improvements are consistent with the Biden administration's  National Security Memorandum on United States Global Leadership to  Strengthen the International Response. This statutory framework is not  overly prescriptive, and it does not prejudge the outcome of the  current response framework offered by this administration.   Republican and Democratic Presidents alike have recognized the  critical importance of global health security; from President Obama's  role in launching a global health security agenda to President Trump's  National Security Strategy and National Biodefense Strategy.                                time  1515    Global health crises are ongoing and increasing, and they affect  national security.   Saving lives from the next global pandemic starts now, by investing  in preparedness before it strikes.   Diseases, as I said, don't respect borders, and global health crises  have immense security, economic, and humanitarian consequences as all  too tragically we have learned from the one we are still going through.   I am proud that the Global Health Security Act has passed the House  three times already, and I hope the Senate will act swiftly on this  piece of legislation.
