 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1049,  the National Heritage Area Act.   Since 1984, the National Heritage Area program has played a vital  role in preserving the history, culture and natural beauty of our  Nation's most historically and naturally significant communities. It  has worked closely with those communities to help make them vibrant and  ensure their place as part of the national landscape.   In my home State of Rhode Island, the Blackstone River Valley  National Heritage Corridor plays a vital role in preserving the history  of communities in Blackstone Valley, the birthplace of the American  Industrial Revolution.   In addition to preserving this history, the coordinating entity for  the Blackstone Valley Heritage Corridor works hand in hand with the  National Park Service to support the continued development of the  Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park, which runs from  Providence and Pawtucket through Worcester, Massachusetts.   I was proud to lead the House effort to establish this national park  in 2014 and look forward to seeing its continued growth and development  in close coordination with the Blackstone Heritage Corridor.   The relationship between the Blackstone Heritage Corridor and the  Blackstone Valley National Historical Park plays a vital role in  telling the story of how America became a prosperous nation through its  mills and factories, and the immigrant communities in Rhode Island and  Massachusetts that worked in those industries and that helped build the  foundation of our country.   The National Heritage Area Act will ensure that this relationship can  continue by authorizing funds for heritage areas through 2034 and  fostering new opportunities for relationships between heritage areas  and the National Park Service to grow.   While the Trump administration has proposed eliminating this critical  program year after year, I am grateful for the work of my colleague  from New York, Congressman Paul Tonko, for his leadership on this  issue. And I thank Chairman Grijalva and the Natural Resources  Committee for their efforts to bring this legislation to the floor.   I urge passage of H.R. 1049, to support the National Heritage Area  program and to continue preserving our Nation's history and natural  beauty.                                time  1730
