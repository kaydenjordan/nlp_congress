 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana.   Madam Speaker, President Biden had an opportunity during the State of  the Union address to communicate to the American people what his  administration has learned from its policy failures of the past year  and lay out a plan to correct course. Unfortunately, that didn't  happen.   I was not surprised that the President used this address as a  political tool to double down on his assault on American energy,  mandates, and Big Government spending. These policy decisions have  emboldened our adversaries and led to record high inflation, business  losing workers, rising crime across the country, and a wide open  southern border.   If President Biden really believed that doing the same thing will  solve any of the crises his administration created, he is either  totally out of touch or ignoring the facts. Either way, the President  took the easy way out. What is easy is not always right.   Be assured, Republicans will not shy away from our duty to always put  America first, to rebuild our economic engine, restore individual  liberty, and renew the American Dream.
