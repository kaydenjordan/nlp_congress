 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I am here today to discuss my amendment to  H.R. 3091, the Federal Law Enforcement Officer Service Weapon Purchase  Act.   Currently, firearms from agencies such as the Secret Service are  destroyed once they are retired from service or replaced with new  models. This is wasteful and makes no sense. Many law enforcement  officers have a special connection to their firearms they use in the  line of duty. They would like to take them home to cherish as family  heirlooms.   It is only fair to allow the courageous men and women of law  enforcement to purchase their service weapons upon retirement, and we  should let them do that at a low cost because these are going to be  thrown out anyway.   This shouldn't be a revenue-raising scheme for the government. Our  law enforcement officers should be able to keep their firearms at a  reasonable cost.   My amendment simply changes H.R. 3091 by changing the term ``fair  market value'' to ``salvage value,'' which is what would be done to the  weapons anyway, salvaging it.   Salvage value is defined as: ``The value of the asset after it  becomes useless to the owner or the amount expected to be obtained when  a fixed asset is disposed of at the end of its useful life,'' which is  exactly what is happening here.   This definition is for the lawyers, appraisers, and accountants, but  what I want to talk about is what it means to our law enforcement  officers.   This change would allow them to purchase their retired service  firearms, which in many cases they discharged in the line of duty to  save lives, at a lower cost than the current ``fair market value,''  which it would not be disposed at.   Under current policy, these firearms are destroyed, so the purchase  is at salvage value by definition. It would still increase government  revenues, because you are actually purchasing it at the same amount and  you wouldn't have to actually have the expense of salvaging it, while  allowing Federal law enforcement officers to purchase the service  weapons that have protected them throughout their careers at a fair  price.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Mr. Chair, the basic premise is a misunderstanding of  what this is about.   First of all, the weapon would otherwise be destroyed. The only money  that would come from it is either the money that is spent on destroying  the weapon or the money that was obtained from it by destroying the  weapon which would be salvage monetary price, which would be  approximately $100 for an average Glock. That is weapon scrap. That is  what it is worth. That is how much you would get back from the  government.   The gentleman from New York talks about the government supplementing  police officers who served an entire career. I was a career military  person with over 20 years in the military. My father was a deputy  sheriff. This isn't a money-making scheme. As a matter of fact, it is  just the opposite. This isn't for the government to make money off of.  This is to do the right thing.   This is at best a neutral bill. This shouldn't be about the military  people who just spent 20 years of their life paying money to expand the  coffers of the American government when otherwise it would be worth  about $100 as scrap metal.   The misrepresentation that this should be money that our retirees  spend on a weapon that would otherwise be destroyed--and nothing else  would be done with that weapon, by the way. When the gentleman talks  about fair market value, the fair market value in the market for this  is salvage. It is what would be done with the weapon to begin with. The  misnomer, the misrepresentation that retired officers that have spent  their entire career protecting this Nation, bonding with something that  saves their lives and protects other people, is actually kind of  offensive to me as a guy who has carried around a service rifle and a  service pistol, when I was overseas, in harm's way, the same way my  father carried around his service pistol in harm's way.   This is not to make money for the government. This is to do the right  thing by those police officers and those law enforcement individuals  who served their entire life doing nothing but serving their community.  That is what this is about and nothing else.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am going to define once again what this  bill is about because I disagree wholeheartedly. If it is at the end of  its service life, if it is no longer useful, it is going to be  salvaged. Salvaged. We are defining what is happening at the end of a  useful life value. Salvaged. It is going to be destroyed. That is what  the government will do with it. The government is not going to sell it;  the government is going to salvage it. The government is not going to  put it on the market, the fair market for a used weapon, they are going  to destroy it.   Therefore, the value of the weapon is whatever it is destroyed for.  That is the definition. That is clear in this bill, and that has been  defined. Trying to mislead the public on what this is about is, once  again, offensive to me.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
