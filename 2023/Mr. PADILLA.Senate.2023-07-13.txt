 Madam President, I rise to reintroduce the LA28 Olympic  and Paralympic Games Commemorative Coin Act.   The LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games Commemorative Coin would direct  the Treasury Department to mint and issue coins in commemoration of the  ninth time that the United States will host the modern Olympics and the  third time that our Nation will host the Paralympics.   The proceeds from the sale of these coins will support the hosting of  the 2028 Games and aid in the execution of its legacy programs,  including the promotion of youth sports in the United States. It is  also worth noting that this bill would come at no cost to the Federal  Government.   As you may know, the United States is one of the only countries with  an Olympic Committee that does not receive funding from the Federal  Government. All U.S.-hosted Olympic Games must instead rely on  corporate partnerships, proceeds from broadcast agreements and ticket  sales, and philanthropic contributions.   Historically, Congress has authorized commemorative coins to honor  the Olympic Games and Olympic athletes, including for the 1984, 1996,  and 2002 Olympic Games in the United States. The 2028 games are 5 years  from today, and preparations for this grand event are already underway  in the region. This legislation can help ensure the 2028 games has the  resources necessary to be a world-class event.   I thank Senators Feinstein and Romney for introducing this  legislation with me in the Senate, as well as Representative Sherman  for leading it in the House. I hope all of our colleagues will join us  in supporting this bill to ensure that Los Angeles, CA and our entire  Nation are able to put on a successful and memorable 2028 Olympic and  Paralympic Games.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to reintroduce the LA28 Olympic  and Paralympic Games Commemorative Coin Act.
