 Madam President, I rise in support of the motion that  shortly will be made by our colleague, the Senator from Florida. I want  to congratulate Senator Cardin and him for their leadership in this  regard. I appreciate the chairman and myself having joined them and  moving this expeditiously through the committee, and I am looking  forward to its critical passage on the floor. Time is of the essence.   The people of Hong Kong are fighting for their lives. Six months ago,  millions of Hong Kong citizens took to the streets to peacefully  protest the erosion of their democracy and their rights. Now, half a  year later, we find mounting anger and unrest, with the violence  against students and protesters--most dramatically, in the crackdown on  Hong Kong Polytechnic University--only getting worse.   People are being shot. Universities are being burned. The violence  perpetrated by the authorities in Hong Kong and, by extension, Beijing  are turning the city into a battlefield.   This is not the Hong Kong that any of us want to see. The special  character of Hong Kong is one of the world's great success stories. The  vibrancy of the people of Hong Kong, especially its young people and  the rising generation of leaders standing up for democracy and self- governance, should inspire all of us.   We admire Hong Kong's success as a burgeoning economic powerhouse,  and we admire the vibrant and autonomous civil society and civic life  that has flourished under the ``one country, two systems'' principle.   Hong Kong is one of the remarkable success stories of the Indo- Pacific--one  [[Page S6652]]  of the most remarkable success stories of China and the Chinese  people--and it is a success worth protecting.   I call on the police to act professionally and to treat its fellow  citizens with respect and restraint. We call for Beijing and the Hong  Kong authorities to address the noble and legitimate aspirations of the  people of Hong Kong.   In these turbulent times, the Congress of the United States must lead  with our values. We must stand on the side of freedom and human  dignity, and we must send a clear and uncompromising statement that  America stands with the people of Hong Kong in their quest to maintain  their self-governance and autonomy, to safeguard their human rights, to  exercise their democratic freedom, and to determine their own future.   The House of Representatives already passed their version of this  bill, and the situation in Hong Kong grows more tenuous by the day.  That is why the United States should and must act today.   I look forward to the passage of this bill without delay. Let us work  to hold China accountable for the erosion of democracy in Hong Kong,  and let us together send a message to the people of Hong Kong that  their cries for democracy and freedom have been heard through both  Chambers of the U.S. Congress, and that America stands with them in  their call for justice and self-determination.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I want to take a moment to  congratulate my colleague from Oregon and a distinguished member of the  Foreign Relations Committee who has worked on this issue, alongside of  Senator Cornyn, with great skill in a way that allowed the legislation  we just passed to take place, which he strongly supports, and to make  his legislation, along with Senator Cornyn, a reality shortly. He has  been very adept about it and very constructive. It is going to be a  great moment when we send a message that U.S. weaponry isn't going to  be part of the oppression in Hong Kong. I salute him, and I join him in  his effort.                             Additional Cosponsor    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be included as an  original cosponsor of the legislation.    Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute and  to recognize a New Jersey organization celebrating its 25th  anniversary, the New Jersey Community Development Corporation, NJCDC. I  wish to take a moment now to honor NJCDC for the important work it is  doing in the State of New Jersey and the accomplishments it has  achieved over the past 25 years.   The NJCDC provides hope for a rewarding future through urban  revitalization efforts, financial support, education initiatives, and  job creation. The work done by NJCDC has directly transformed the lives  of many, especially in the city of Paterson.   In honor of the accomplishments of this organization, I ask that a  proclamation honoring the 25th anniversary of the NJCDC be printed in  the Record.   The material follows:   Whereas, the New Jersey Community Development Corporation is a non- profit community development and social service agency based in the  City of Paterson, New Jersey;   Whereas, the New Jersey Community Development Corporation and its  dedicated staff empowers individuals to transform their lives and  offers a variety of programs and services to assist economically  disadvantaged individuals, at-risk youth, and people with disabilities;   Whereas, the New Jersey Community Development Corporation has  contributed to the revitalization of the City of Paterson and the Great  Falls Historic District, helping to ensure a vibrant future for the  City and its residents; and   Whereas, now as the New Jersey Community Development Corporation  celebrates its 25th Anniversary, I congratulate its staff and  volunteers on this milestone.   Therefore, in presenting this citation to the New Jersey Community  Development Corporation, I, on behalf of the People of the State of New  Jersey hereby congratulate the New Jersey Community Development  Corporation and its contribution to the community, the City of  Paterson, and the State of New Jersey.                            ____________________
