 Madam Speaker, today is my dad's 88th birthday. As a  CPA he taught me about financial responsibility. He taught me about  paying our bills on time. I am sure he never could imagine our Congress  would or could possibly put the full faith and credit of the United  States at risk, but that is exactly the path my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle are advocating today.   The stakes could not be higher. Secretary Yellen has said that it  would be catastrophic for the United States to default on its debt.  There would be chaos in the financial markets, higher interest rates,  slowed economic growth, an estimated 6 million lost jobs, and $15  trillion of people's wealth disappeared.   For the last 4 years the Republicans have run up our Nation's debt.  The bill is now due, and the Republicans want to tear up the statement  and throw away the checkbook.                                time  1515    Burying our heads in the sand won't solve our problems, and it won't  keep our creditors at bay. It will, however, cause catastrophic damage  to our Nation's credibility, damage to our Nation's economy, damage to  our Nation's future, to our children's future.   I urge my colleagues to put the partisanship aside, put the country  first. Let's vote ``yes'' on this bill and make sure that our country  pays its debts.
