 Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Roe for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4356, the Protecting  Families of Fallen Servicemembers Act.  [[Page H8758]]    Mr. Speaker, as a member of the armed services, I know how important  it is to protect the families of those who serve when tragedy strikes.  That is why I was proud to join Representative Harder to introduce this  legislation, which will allow the spouses and dependents of  servicemembers who are killed or catastrophically injured in the line  of duty to terminate their phone, internet, and TV contracts without  penalty.   Last year, the Veterans Benefits and Transition Act of 2018 passed  the House with overwhelming support. That legislation included a number  of changes to existing law to protect our servicemembers and our Gold  Star families.   However, due to a drafting error, the bill only allowed  servicemembers, not their spouses and dependents, to end their phone,  internet, and TV contracts without penalty. This bill corrects that  error and ensures that grieving families are able to terminate  contracts, giving them the freedom to relocate based on the needs of  their families.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the House Veterans' Affairs Committee for  advancing this legislation to the floor, and I urge all Members to  support this bill.
