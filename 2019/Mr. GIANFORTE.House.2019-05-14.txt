 Mr. Speaker, during National Police Week, I rise to  recognize police officers in Montana who protect and serve our  communities. They put their lives on the line to keep us safe.   Montana Highway Patrol Trooper Wade Palmer embodies this selfless  service. A husband to Lindsey and a father to two young daughters,  Trooper Palmer started with the patrol in 2012 and has received the  patrol's highest honor, the Medal of Valor.   In March, Trooper Palmer located a suspicious vehicle near Missoula.  As he sat in his cruiser, a callous coward approached Palmer and shot  him repeatedly. Thankfully, Trooper Palmer regained consciousness and  is recovering in the hospital.   As we mark National Police Week, let us remember all who died in the  line of duty. Let us remember to pray every day for the men and women  in blue, as well as their families. And let us say a special prayer for  Trooper Palmer and his family.                            ____________________
