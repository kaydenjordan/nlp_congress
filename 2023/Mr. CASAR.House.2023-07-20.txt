 Madam Speaker, I am  Greg Casar, and I represent the heart  of Texas.   Thirteen years ago, I stood alongside construction workers as we  sounded the alarm at Austin City Hall that workers were dying after  being forced to work for hours on end in the sun without rest and  without a water break. Our community came together and passed a local  protection to guarantee everyone this basic right.  [[Page H3877]]    Five years later, families in Dallas were mourning the losses of  fathers and sons and brothers and tios who died on the job because  they, too, were forced to work without a water break. That community  came together to pass protections that guarantee this basic right.   Now, as San Antonio bears the hottest 10-day streak in recorded  history and as our globe bears the hottest days in recorded history,  this month, people in San Antonio want to pass those same sort of  protections, but Governor Greg Abbott signed a priority bill  eliminating the right to water breaks for Texas workers beginning  September 1.   People are dying, like Eugene Gates and Justin Cory Foster and Felipe  Pascual, dying while working in the Texas heat this year. We don't need  more Texans dying in the sun. Instead, we need OSHA and the Biden  administration to take immediate action in passing a Federal heat  protection rule, because bearing the Texas heat is brutal but forcing  workers to work in that heat is cruel.                            ____________________
