 Mr. Speaker, I was grateful this  weekend to visit and thank volunteers at local shelters in the Midlands  of South Carolina for helping families displaced from their homes due  to Hurricane Irma.   At the South Carolina Emergency Preparedness Center in Pine Ridge,  Governor Henry McMaster ably received updates to make thoughtful  decisions to protect citizens. Emergency Management Division Director  Kim Stenson professionally hosted over a dozen State agencies with FEMA  Coordinator Willie Nunn. Adjutant General Robert Livingston and the  Army National Guard were vital in preparation efforts.   While visiting the Dent Middle School Red Cross shelter, we were  welcomed by Principal Tamala Murrill Ashford, Red Cross Executive  Director Rebecca Jordan, Beth Shwedo, and volunteers dedicated to  service.   State officials and the South Carolina Army National Guard have been  successful leaders for preparation. Attorney General Alan Wilson led  efforts to reduce price gouging. I appreciate everyone for ensuring  that citizens had the resources for safety.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Our prayers for all  those affected by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.                            ____________________
