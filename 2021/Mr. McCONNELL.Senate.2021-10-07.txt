 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, Republican members and Democratic  members of staff negotiated through the night in good faith. The Senate  is moving toward the plan I laid out yesterday to spare the American  people a manufactured crisis. All year, the Democratic government has  made unprecedented and repeated use of reconciliation to pass radical  policies on party-line votes.   So, back in July, Republicans informed our colleagues they would need  to pursue any long-term increase in the debt ceiling through the same  process. The President, the Speaker, and the Democratic leader had 3  months' notice to do their jobs, but for 2\1/2\ months the Democratic  leaders did nothing and then complained that they were actually short  on time.   The majority didn't have a plan to prevent default, so we stepped  forward. The pathway our Democratic colleagues have accepted will spare  the  [[Page S6950]]  American people any near-term crisis while definitively resolving the  majority's excuse that they lacked time to address the debt limit  through the 304 reconciliation process. Now there will be no question;  they will have plenty of time.   Or, if our colleagues would instead prefer a more traditional  bipartisan discussion around basic governance, they can stop trying to  ram through yet another reckless taxing-and-spending spree that would  hurt families and help China. That would be the path toward that kind  of discussion.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on a related matter, Washington  Democrats are behind closed doors trying to hammer out a multitrillion- dollar reckless taxing-and-spending spree, but we already know a lot  about this bill.   First and foremost, we know their reckless legislation would hurt  American families and actually help China. It is that simple:  inflicting pain on American workers and families while putting us at a  global disadvantage.   Just look at the radical climate policies Democrats have packed into  the spree to satisfy their far-left base. The apples haven't fallen far  from the awful Green New Deal. In the name of clean energy performance,  Democrats want to force electric utilities to model their grids off of  the high-cost, blackout-prone system that liberals have set up in the  State of California; move all 50 States' electric grids toward  California's.   As one group of major power providers observed, not only would this  be logistically unworkable, it would also threaten to send consumers'  electricity costs totally out of control. And in the words of a member  of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission who testified before our  colleagues just last week, the scheme would be ``H-bomb''--``H-bomb''-- for the electricity markets.   At the same time, Democrats are also pushing a brand-new natural gas  tax they call a methane fee. It is a natural gas tax is what it is.  Just as our friends in Europe are facing soaring natural gas costs and  the threat of winter shortages, just as it seems Russia may be  willingly supplying less and less gas to the free world, Democrats want  our Nation to declare war on natural gas, kill tens of thousands of  jobs, drain billions from the economy, and increase costs for our  families--at a moment when U.S. natural gas futures just hit a 12-year  high.   There is no limit to the harm Democrats will inflict on America to  force the heartland to accept elite liberal fashions. Their legislation  includes special giveaways for electric cars that are  disproportionately the preferred option--you guessed it--of wealthy  people, jacking up America's gas bills and utility prices in order to  turn 49 other States into California. It is a bad idea at an awful time  and just one more way their reckless taxing-and-spending spree would  hurt families and help China.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on a related matter, while  Americans contend with Democrats' self-created border crisis and  inflation crisis, our foreign policy is in crisis as well.   The Biden administration's disastrous retreat from Afghanistan may be  over, but the danger to the American citizens and Afghan partners it  left behind certainly is not over. Around the world, adversaries and  allies alike are drawing new conclusions from President Biden's  Afghanistan disaster about America's will to defend our allies and our  interests.   Pyongyang is putting on another master class in how despots disdain  the so-called rules-based international order. Literally, while a North  Korean official was haranguing the U.N. in a speech about the  ``consequences it will bring in the future in case it tries to encroach  upon [its] sovereignty,'' the Kim regime punctuated the speech with yet  another provocative round of U.N. sanctions-violating ballistic missile  tests.   Iranian disregard for international norms and the Biden  administration's efforts to enforce them continues apace. Tehran is  ramping up its nuclear activities, demanding bribes to even return to  the negotiating table, as well as stepping up its use of terrorist  proxies to threaten its adversaries all across the region.   In light of our retreat from Afghanistan, we should not be surprised  if Iranian-backed groups redouble their efforts to inflict U.S.  casualties and otherwise pressure the Biden administration to turn tail  and run from Syria and Iraq.   When it comes to near-peer competitors like Russia, the Biden  campaign's tough talk has been replaced by the Biden administration's  desperate rhetoric of diplomacy. Putin is unfazed and undeterred.   Repression at home, manipulation of energy markets abroad, military  modernization, cyber mischief--this doesn't exactly scream ready for  good-faith engagement.   Most of all, the administration's hollow rhetoric has done nothing to  deter the growing threat from communist China. Just this month, Beijing  has sent a record number of military aircraft on provocative missions  into Taiwan's airspace. As senior Pentagon officials have warned, ``we  are witnessing a strategic breakout'' by China, Democrats still refuse  to let us adequately fund our own military and defense.   The Biden administration's budget falls woefully short of our  requirements for greater competition with China and with Russia--all  the more so given the inevitable growing terror threat. And here in  Congress, Democrats are doubling down on this reckless misstep.  Democrats want to spend trillions of dollars on a socialist wish list  at home while leaving the servicemembers who keep us safe overseas in  the lurch.   Now, I don't expect Chairman Sanders or certain radicals in the House  to be keen on using reconciliation to fund our military--hardly. But  Senate Democrats have left Congress's most fundamental tool for  influencing defense policy--the historically bipartisan NDAA--in  procedural limbo literally for months.   The Democratic leader's latest public statement on his caucus's  spending priorities did not even mention the defense authorization  bill. Apparently, he is content to let it languish behind their  leftwing wish list.   So, Madam President, America is staring down serious and historic  threats. And somehow, with unified control of government, the only  actions Democrats have managed to take on foreign policy have made them  worse.   The American people deserve a lot better than this. Our  servicemembers deserve better. Our allies deserve better. But  Washington Democrats are proving they cannot deliver.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on one final matter, it is a  small group of people who become familiar faces right here on the floor  of the U.S. Senate. There are the Senators themselves, the nonpartisan  professionals on the dais, the Capitol Police, and doorkeepers.   And then, Madam President, you have the men and women of each party's  cloakroom. These small and tight-knit teams keep information flowing  from the Senate floor to Members' offices and vice versa. They track  legislation and amendments. They negotiate procedure across the aisle.  And in a thousand other duties, they all add up to tense days, late  nights, and a truly front-row seat to Congress.   For the last decade, one of those special few has been a daughter of  Kentucky and an alumna of my own office: Megan Mercer.   Megan's Senate story started about 15 years ago, when she spent a  summer as a page. Before long, this impressive young woman took an  internship in my personal office, serving Kentucky; then an entry-level  position in my leadership office here in the Capitol; and then Megan  came here to the floor, to the Republican cloakroom.   A decade ago now, she took a seat behind their big desk. She answered  phones. She answered questions. She learned the ropes. And over 10  years, she worked her way up to a key role of senior floor assistant.   Pick any important vote, and Megan has been right here in the well,  at this table, tallying the count for our side. She has cleared  legislation and consent  [[Page S6951]]  requests. She has negotiated with Democrat counterparts on a daily  basis.   Through it all, Megan's colleagues have come to admire her patience,  level-headedness, and the institutional knowledge she has built up; and  so have we Senators.   Fortunately, the work has not been thankless. I remember Megan was  especially thrilled when Senator Lamar Alexander made sure that Megan's  help with the Music Modernization Act yielded a signed ``thank you''  note from Dolly Parton--one of her all-time favorites.   So as we, unfortunately, prepare for Megan's upcoming departure from  the Senate, I want to thank her for her fine public service. Megan has  made her native Kentucky proud; she has made her parents Dr. Albert and  Robin Mercer very proud; and she has made me proud as well.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
