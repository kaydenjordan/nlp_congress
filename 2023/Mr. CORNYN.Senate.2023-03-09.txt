 Mr. President, the overdose epidemic is ravaging  communities all across this country and leaving a trail of death and  destruction. The latest data shows we lost nearly 107,000 Americans  last year alone. The majority of those deaths were attributed to  fentanyl, a synthetic opioid made from precursors shipped from China,  mainly, to Mexico, where they are then manufactured. Fentanyl alone is  killing 70,000 Americans a year.   On average, we are talking about more than 190 people dying each day  due to fentanyl. That is more people than a commercial 737 airliner can  hold. So imagine the public outrage if, day after day, commercial  airliners fell out of the sky, killing everyone aboard. Well, you can  imagine what the reaction would be. Social media would erupt. People  would protest. Our constituents wouldn't just ask us to intervene; they  would demand it.   Unfortunately--and this is a mystery to me--the fentanyl epidemic and  the drug overdose deaths we have seen in the last year don't get the  same sort of response. It is as though our threshold for outrage now is  so high that even the death of 107,000 Americans would not achieve that  threshold.   We know this epidemic does not discriminate. It kills people of all  ages and backgrounds from major cities and small towns all across  America. But one of the most alarming trends we see is the appalling  trend of fentanyl-related deaths among teenagers. These teens  frequently think they are buying something else, such as Percocet or  OxyContin or Xanax, and unknowingly they end up with a counterfeit pill  contaminated with a deadly dose of fentanyl.   This is the case for students in Hays County, which is just southwest  of Austin, where I live. Since last summer, the Hays Consolidated  Independent School District has lost five students to fentanyl  poisoning.   In October, I had the chance to meet with the parents of one of those  students, Shannon McConville, who lost her 17-year-old son Kevin to  fentanyl poisoning. She told me that Kevin was full of promise, a  talented person, an artist. After graduating, he wanted to join the  Navy and become an underwater welder. But, sadly, Kevin was never able  to realize his dream. He died just a few weeks before the beginning of  his senior year.   A couple of weeks ago, I traveled to Hays County to speak with more  families who have lost their children to fentanyl poisoning, as well as  law enforcement personnel, school officials, and medical professionals,  trying to figure out what do we need to do.   I saw Shannon and her husband Darren, as well as the parents of  another young victim, 15-year-old Noah Rodriguez. Noah's parents,  Brandon and Janel, told me that Noah was a genuine, kind young man and  something of a jokester. He was an athlete, a devoted friend, and a big  brother to his three siblings, the youngest of whom was only 2 weeks  old when Noah died.    Despite their profound loss, these parents and countless others are  committed to raising awareness. You can imagine the courage it takes to  overcome your grief and pain to try to share your story with others so  that others might live.   I had the opportunity to learn about the Fighting Fentanyl public  awareness campaign in Hays County, as well as the work being done by  school leaders and law enforcement. We all acknowledged that there is  no single action that will end this epidemic. We can't just focus on  prevention or treatment or drug diversion; a successful strategy will  involve all three of those. We need buy-in from leaders at every level  of government, as well as healthcare providers, schools, nonprofits,  law enforcement, and, of course, the general public, just like the  approach we are seeing in Hays County. This has to be an all-in effort.  [[Page S733]]    But during our discussion, there was broad agreement that the  starting point should be the source of these drugs, which is our  southern border. All four parents stressed the importance of securing  the border and preventing fentanyl from ever reaching our communities.   Shannon McConville said that when it comes to the border, the Biden  administration is failing. I agree.   Last week, five of my Republican colleagues joined me for a series of  tours and meetings in the Rio Grande Valley, where they got to see the  administration's security failures firsthand. By my calculation, that  is about the 10th delegation that either I or Senator Cruz or both of  us have hosted of colleagues coming to the border in Texas.   Border Patrol agents told us last weekend about the tactics cartels  use to traffic fentanyl and other dangerous drugs into the country.  First and foremost, they distract and overwhelm agents by coordinating  a surge of migrants, which provides a golden opportunity to sneak  across the border undetected--overwhelm the Border Patrol with a swarm  of migrants and distract them while the drugs make their way north.   This isn't news, of course, to the Biden administration. It is a  well-known maneuver used by the cartels, acknowledged by the Attorney  General of the United States last week when he came before the Senate  Judiciary Committee. But for some reason, the administration seems  determined to just simply look the other way.   President Biden's apathetic approach to the southern border must  change in order for us to have a chance at addressing this public  health crisis. Just think about a burst pipe in your home. If water is  pouring from the ceiling, what do you do first? Well, you aren't going  to go grab buckets and towels to start cleaning the water while it is  still raining down; you are going to turn the main water supply off and  stop the leak at its source. That is what we need to do here: Cut off  the supply. Until that happens, we are going to be fighting a losing  battle, and more people will die.   It is well known that the southern border is a major gateway for  illegal drugs. In the last 12 months, Customs and Border Protection  have seized 23,000 pounds of fentanyl at the southern border, enough to  wipe out the entire U.S. population many times over.   That is a daunting statistic, but we know this number isn't the full  story. It only includes the drugs that our law enforcement officials  were able to stop. We know from all the deaths and wide availability of  fentanyl and other illegal drugs in America that much more than that  makes its way into the interior of our country. So there is no exact  way to know how much fentanyl has slipped through the cracks, but the  fact that we are losing 70,000 Americans a year to fentanyl is proof  that we aren't batting a perfect game--far from it.   Let's not forget the fact that law enforcement at every level is also  encountering and attempting to stop the fentanyl proliferation. Last  month, the Collin County Sheriff's Office and North Texas Sheriff's  Criminal Interdiction Unit arrested a Dallas man with about 6,000  fentanyl pills in his vehicle during a traffic stop. Last year, the  Drug Enforcement Administration seized more than 379 million lethal  doses of fentanyl--enough to kill every American.   Drug trafficking is obviously a lucrative business, and cartels take  advantage of every security gap in order to make money. There is no  question that the ongoing border crisis has provided the perfect  opportunity for these cartels, who care nothing about people. All they  care about is the money.   If Border Patrol agents are changing diapers and passing out meals,  as they have had to do to manage the volume of migrants coming across  the border, they can't control the frontlines and stop cartels from  trafficking these dangerous drugs into the interior.   I want to be clear. I am not suggesting that every migrant who comes  across is responsible for the drugs coming across the border--far from  it. But the mass movement of people orchestrated by these transnational  criminal organizations, even including people with legitimate asylum  claims, opens the opportunity--gateways, if you will--for truly  dangerous criminals and substances to come across the border. Unless  something changes, it is going to get worse. In order to save lives, we  have got to secure the border and stop fentanyl from reaching our  communities. That should be the first step.    As a matter of fact, the President, in his State of the Union last  month, said that he wanted Members of Congress to pass his plan to  provide the officers and equipment needed to secure the border. Now,  that surprised me because I wasn't aware that the President had a plan,  but there is no question that border security legislation is needed and  those resources are necessary.   We need to strengthen this combination of technology, boots on the  ground, and infrastructure that Border Patrol tells me is the key to  successfully securing the border, and that is the only way to stop  dangerous drugs and criminals who mingle in with economic migrants and  other asylum seekers to make their way across the border into the  interior of the United States.   There is no doubt we also need to reform the asylum process to ensure  that personnel, technology, and infrastructure can properly focus on  interdicting narcotics and other contraband.   Anyone who questions the need for these measures should talk with the  parents who have had to bury their children; talk with the brothers and  sisters who have lost a sibling; talk with the teenagers who are  grieving at the unexpected losses of healthy and vibrant friends. We  owe it to them and to the countless people who are terrified by this  looming threat to stop these drugs at the source.   Obviously, what we are doing now is not sufficient. It is not  working. I heard, again, Attorney General Garland say: Well, we are  doing everything we can. And that is not true. He may think he is doing  everything he can, but, obviously, it isn't working.   We can't accept failure. We have got to come up with a formula to  address this as we did yesterday during an open hearing in the  Intelligence Committee where I asked the leaders of our national  security Agencies: What else can you offer? what other resources? What  other authorities do you need in order to stop this dying of people who  are taking fentanyl and other illegal drugs coming across the border?   But it starts with securing the border, and we will be fighting a  continuing losing battle until that is done.   I yield the floor.                   Nomination of James Edward Simmons, Jr.
