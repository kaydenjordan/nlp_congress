 Mr. Speaker, I was home over the weekend and saw a lot  of folks in the district, and they are baffled by the handling of this  Chinese spy balloon situation.   Regular folks are wondering: Why in the world was this thing handled  or not handled the way it was? Why was it allowed to travel across the  entire North American Continent, through the NORAD system, from Alaska  through Canada down through our Midwestern States, and finally exiting  at Carolina?   Why wasn't another way found to bring the balloon down slowly, maybe  just a couple of bullet holes in the balloon itself instead of  allegedly a million-dollar missile hitting the spy array so there is  not going to be any evidence as it got dumped into the ocean?   There are a lot of questions to be answered about this, and we are  not getting very good answers out of the military or out of the White  House.   Tomorrow night, the President is going to be standing about 10 feet  away from this spot right here, and I hope he has some really good  answers on what our air defense system looks like in this country. How  much spying is allowed to go on by balloon, for crying out loud?    We know the satellites that are up there and stuff, but this is a  breach of the trust of our country, and we are looking foolish around  the world by allowing this to happen.                            ____________________
