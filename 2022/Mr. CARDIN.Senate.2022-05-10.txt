 Madam President, I rise to express the urgent need to  pass the Women's Health Protection Act and put an end to the constant  attacks that have chipped away at women's constitutional rights in this  country. Now more than ever, it is vital to codify reproductive rights  and protect other hard-won civil rights as they face renewed threats.   Last week, POLITICO published Supreme Court Associate Justice Alito's  [[Page S2408]]  draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health, which, while not  final, would strike down Roe v. Wade. This would have an immediate and  devastating consequence for the health and well-being of tens of  millions of women of reproductive age across the Nation. Women in low- income families who could not overcome the financial and logical  barriers to travel to States with abortion access will suffer the most,  increasing existing health disparities.   While this draft opinion is a reminder of what is at stake, we have  seen the erosion of reproductive rights for decades. Despite the clear  constitutional rights the Supreme Court established almost 50 years ago  in the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, each year, legislatures across  the country have passed harmful abortion restrictions in an effort to  impede a woman's fundamental right to make the best informed healthcare  decisions for herself and her family. This goes against what I believe  to be one of the fundamental responsibilities of the Court, which is to  expand rights, not restrict them.   Implementing the Bill of Rights, we have seen the Federal courts over  a period of time protect Americans against the abuse of power,  including the power exercised by our government. Should this opinion go  into effect, this would be the first time in memory that the Court  would act to take away the constitutional rights of Americans. It would  also be the first time in our country's history when women now would  have fewer rights than their mothers.   The reasoning used in this draft decision could also be used to  undermine other dearly held civil rights in the future. Justice Alito's  leaked draft opinion laid out a roadmap to overturn other landmark  decisions that expanded rights, including Obergefell v. Hodges, which  affirmed marriage equality.   Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett all testified under oath  before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Supreme Court precedents  should stand--a bedrock principle of jurisprudence known as stare  decisis--but they clearly arrived with an agenda to overturn Roe, and  now, they are making that a reality.   Senate Republicans and former President Donald Trump bear  responsibility for nominating and confirming Justices far outside of  the legal mainstream and damaging our confirmation process and the  public's faith in the Supreme Court as an impartial arbiter of our  Nation's laws.   Senate Republicans deliberately stole the seat that President Barack  Obama nominated Merrick Garland to fill, and they delayed even having a  hearing for 1 year, effectively shrinking the size of the Supreme  Court. Senate Republicans then turned around and rushed the  confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett after the death of Justice  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, even though early voting had already begun in the  2020 Presidential elections.   Overturning Roe goes against public opinion. A recent poll of the  Washington Post-ABC showed that 70 percent of Americans believe that  the Court should uphold Roe and that decisions regarding abortion  should be left to a woman and her doctor.   Now more than ever, it is essential for the Senate to pass the  Women's Health Protection Act, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor.  The legislation would protect the right to abortion free from medically  unnecessary restrictions and create a statutory right for providers to  provide and patients to receive care. This would codify Roe v. Wade and  prevent States from continuing to enact restrictions on reproductive  freedoms.   Despite the opinion just being a draft and abortion still being a  constitutional right, States are already seizing on the momentum of  this draft opinion and moving to limit a woman's constitutional right.  Since the leak of this draft opinion, legislatures around the country  are rushing to criminalize abortion and outlaw contraception.   Just last week, the Louisiana State Legislature advanced a bill that  would classify abortion as homicide. This adds to the over half of our  States that have already passed laws to restrict and ban abortion  access. There are more than one dozen States with anti-abortion laws  set to take effect immediately if the Supreme Court strikes down Roe v.  Wade.   The Republican leader, Mr. McConnell, stated:         If the leaked opinion became the final opinion, legislative       bodies--not only at the state level but at the federal       level--certainly could legislate in that area.    Thanks to five unelected, activist Justices on the Supreme Court,  women are facing the prospect of a Federal, nationwide ban on abortion  services. We go back to those days where abortions were performed  illegally in back alleys. We can't let that happen in this country.   While many States, including my home State of Maryland, have acted to  expand abortion care, we cannot rely on a patchwork of State laws to  protect a basic constitutional right. The right to choose is  fundamental and a decision that a woman should make in consultation  with a doctor or other healthcare provider free of political  interference from Federal, State, or local government.   I urge President Biden and the Department of Health and Human  Services, the Department of Justice, and other Federal Agencies to use  their power and to act swiftly to safeguard the reproductive rights of  Americans.   There is no denying that this is a bleak moment. We know the battle  for reproductive rights has been an ongoing struggle with previous  setbacks. We saw this just a few months ago following the anti-choice,  pro-vigilante law that the Texas Legislature passed which threatens  providers with jail time and fines for administering what is still  federally and constitutionally protected medical care for women.   We cannot wait any longer. We must do everything in our power to  ensure access to reproductive services now. Therefore, I urge my  colleagues to pass the Women's Health Protection Act, and we will have  a chance to do that starting tomorrow.   Throughout my time in Congress, I have been a steadfast supporter of  reproductive rights, and this will not change. Regardless of the  outcome of tomorrow's vote or the Supreme Court's final decision, I  will continue to do everything within my power to ensure that women can  have access to the care they need.   I yield the floor.
