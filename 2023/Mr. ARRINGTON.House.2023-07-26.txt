 Mr. Chair, I am grateful to my appropriator colleagues  for rightsizing the bureaucracy and reining in the wasteful and  unnecessary spending after this government grew 40 percent during  COVID. The taxpayers deserve fiduciaries who spend their money like it  was our money. That is really the prevailing philosophy we should all  embrace. I, again, commend the appropriators for the painstaking  efforts to rein this in.   I support the bill, but I highlight in an amendment one of the most  egregious and largest wasteful spending categories, and that is  improper payments. The Federal Government wastefully and fraudulently  spends taxpayer money at an alarming rate. In 2021, it was almost $300  billion. Last year, it was $245 billion.   Mr. Chairman, that is money you could spend on a soldier or a sailor  or on a safety net or infrastructure. It is going nowhere. It is larger  than the Departments of Energy, Commerce, and Justice. It is a third of  our defense spending.   The VA is not the only problem. It is pervasive. At the VA, there is  a long-term care category that has an improper payment rate of 47  percent. Think about that. Almost 50 cents on every dollar is wasted in  this program. It is unconscionable, Mr. Chairman.   If you look across the board, the earned income tax credit, 30 cents  on every dollar wasted, $18 billion. The Medicaid program wasted $80  billion last year. The child tax credit wasted $5 billion. The list  goes on. If we are going to rein in spending, if we are going to save  the country from a debt crisis, we have got to get our fiscal house in  order and focus on improper payments. It is not right.
