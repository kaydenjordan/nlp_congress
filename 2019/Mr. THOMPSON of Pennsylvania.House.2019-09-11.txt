 Madam Speaker, I rise today, on the  18th anniversary of September 11, 2001, to reflect on the events of  that fateful day and to honor the lives lost and the heroes that united  us.   At 8:46 a.m., American Airlines Flight 11 roared over Lower Manhattan  and into Tower 1 of the World Trade Center. Shortly after, Flight 175  struck Tower 2.   Our country was under attack. Many of us could never imagine such  evil taking place in our own backyard.   The terror did not stop in New York City. The Pentagon, center of our  Armed Forces and national defense and our Nation's Capital, was also a  target of evil. Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon at 9:38 a.m. It was  a turning point in our history and changed the way we would view the  world forever.   The fourth plane hijacked that day was United 93, crashing into a  field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.   Here in the Capitol, as you exit the north side of the rotunda, a  plaque displays the names of the 40 passengers and crew of United 93.   One of those aboard was Flight Attendant Sandra Bradshaw. Sandra had  always wanted to be a flight attendant and was living out that dream,  traveling and meeting new people.   At 9:30 a.m. on 9/11, she called her husband and told him that United  93 had been hijacked. She said the crew and passengers had decided to  try to take back the plane. Their sacrifice saved countless lives, and  I can't help but think they may have saved this very building where we  sit today from destruction.   Our country's fight against terrorism did not happen on a battlefield  on the  [[Page H7600]]  other side of the world but over the skies of Pennsylvania, New York,  and Virginia by ordinary American citizens.   The courage and bravery of Flight 93 was not the only heroism on  display that day. Firefighters, police officers, and first responders  jumped into action without hesitation. When planes crashed, they ran  in. When fires ignited, they ran in. When buildings collapsed, they ran  in. Their courage never wavered.   We will never forget the lives lost and must always remember the  heroism that was shown. And while we cannot bring our loved ones back,  we can honor their memory through acts of service.   To maintain the spirit of unity and compassion that stem from the  attacks, every year our country proclaims September 11 as Patriot Day.  It is a great way to honor the souls we lost and pay tribute to all who  sacrificed their lives.   As President Bush said when he addressed the Nation: ``Terrorist  attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they  cannot touch the foundation of America. These attacks shattered steel,  but they cannot dent the steel of American resolve.''                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  a remarkable young man, Jakob Zernick, from Cambria County,  Pennsylvania.   Jakob is a 13-year-old with a green thumb who started his own  nonprofit called Seedz 4 Needz.   Jakob grows celery, Brussels sprouts, potatoes, and more to support  the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, where he has been receiving  treatment for Crohn's disease for the last 5 years.   Jakob sells his produce at a vegetable stand outside his home in  Ebensburg and uses the money to purchase toys, games, books, and more  items to gift to children who are patients at the hospital.   According to Jakob, he is projected to raise $10,000 this year to  benefit the Children's Hospital. His efforts have been recognized by  the community, and Jakob's neighbors have been incredibly supportive,  offering their own donations as well.   Most notably, Saint Francis University of Loretto, Pennsylvania,  donated a $1,000 check to Seedz 4 Needz to help Jakob continue his  mission.   I am proud of the work that Jakob has done, and I look forward to  seeing Seedz 4 Needz grow.                            ____________________
