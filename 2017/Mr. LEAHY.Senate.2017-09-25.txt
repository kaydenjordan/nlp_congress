 Mr. President, one of the most pernicious threats to the  right of employees and consumers to access our judicial system has been  the rise of forced arbitration. This practice unfairly eliminates  access to our courts for millions of Americans. When used by employers,  forced arbitration serves to shield corporations from the  [[Page S5881]]  consequences of harmful behavior, such as discrimination or sexual  harassment. Today, the Senate is considering a nominee for the National  Labor Relations Board, or NLRB, who has advocated in favor of forced  arbitration in the employment context. Mr. Emanuel's support for  stripping American workers of their rights is an important reason why I  am opposing his nomination.   The shadow justice system brought about by forced arbitration results  in real harm to employees while serving only to protect powerful  corporate employers. In a high-profile example from last year, former  FOX News host Gretchen Carlson was barred from speaking publicly about  her allegations of sexual harassment against the company's former  chairman, Roger Ailes. Had she not spoken out and instead complied with  the private arbitration clause in her contract, her case would have  been hidden from public view, denying other victims of harassment the  knowledge that they were not alone.   In another disturbing case reported earlier this year, hundreds of  current and former employees of Sterling Jewelers, a company that earns  $6 billion in annual revenue, have for years alleged that the company  is engaged in pervasive gender discrimination and has fostered a  culture that condones sexual harassment. According to reports, this  shocking behavior dates as far back as the early 1990s. Despite decades  of allegations from women at the company, these claims were hidden  behind closed doors because of private arbitration. The full details  are still unknown today.   These are just two examples that highlight the serious harm forced  arbitration can cause employees. During the Obama administration, the  NLRB found that the use of forced arbitration by employers to limit  employees' rights to enter into class or collective actions violated  the National Labor Relations Act. Mr. Emanuel participated in key cases  related to this decision. I am concerned that his history of advocacy  on this issue could lead to his prejudging the outcomes of subsequent  cases that come before the Board.   Unfortunately, Mr. Emanuel declined during his confirmation hearing  to recuse himself from decisions related to forced arbitration should  he become a member of the Board. His other answers on this issue did  not sufficiently allay my concern that he would work to undermine the  rights of employees to access our judicial system. As someone who has  fought for years to protect Americans' access to the courts and has  introduced legislation to limit the harms caused by forced arbitration,  I must oppose his nomination.    Mr. President, recently, I heard from Mayor John Hollar  and City Manager Bill Fraser of Montpelier, VT, about a wonderful  gesture by Philippe Saurel, the mayor of Montpellier, France, who is  also the president of Montpellier Mediterranee Metropolis.   The story is this: the city of Montpellier, France, ordered soccer  jerseys to support its soccer club. They were printed with the name  Montpelier--the way we spell it in Vermont--rather than Montpellier, as  it is in France. As a result, Mr. Saurel, with M. Laurent Nicollin, the  president of the Soccer Club of Montpellier, offered to send these  jerseys to the Montpelier, VT, high school soccer teams.   As the only U.S. Senator ever born in Montpelier, VT, I was thrilled  and wrote to the mayor of Montpellier, France, with gratitude. The more  I thought about it, the more I wanted to make sure the U.S. Senate  heard about this generous act. I ask unanimous consent to have printed  in the Record the letter from Mayor Philippe Saurel to Mayor John  Hollar. The tie between our two great nations and our two beautiful  cities continues.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  Letter From Mayor Saurel to Mayor Hollar         Dear Mayor Hollar, I'm writing to you from Montpellier,       south of France. The starting point of our story is that       [both our] cities have almost the same name.        You have already heard about the story of the soccer shirts       on social networks[.] [T]here was a mistake during the       printing, and now Montpelier spelled as the name of your city       is [written] on the shirts of the soccer team.        We would be very delighted with M. Laurent Nicollin,       President of the Soccer  [[Page S5882]]       Club of Montpellier, to offer the shirts with the name of       your city to your school's soccer team. M. Mayor Hollar do       not hesitate to tell me if you agree with this gift, in that       way we will write together a great story.        Moreover, I also hope to meet you one day, I will be very       pleased to welcome you in Montpellier.            Yours faithfully,                                                Philippe Saurel,                                  Mayor of Montpellier, President of                               Montpellier Mediterranee Metropolis.    (At the request of Mr. McConnell, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
