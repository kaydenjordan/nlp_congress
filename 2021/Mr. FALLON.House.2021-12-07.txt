 Madam Speaker, I want to take a minute to thank Ranking  Member Rogers for his tremendous leadership.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the 2022 National  Defense Authorization Act. Not only does this bill authorize the  necessary investments to maintain our global competitiveness in the  face of increasing Chinese and Russian aggression, but it takes  critical steps to protect our men and women in uniform.   In particular, this bill authorizes almost $200 million in lifesaving  technology to prevent Humvee rollovers. I am honored to represent Red  River Army Depot where a significant portion of this work will be done.   The investment will save the American taxpayers $12.8 billion  compared to the Army's original plan, and it will save countless lives.   Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member and all of our colleagues  on the Armed Services Committee for their work on this, and I urge  final passage of this bill.
