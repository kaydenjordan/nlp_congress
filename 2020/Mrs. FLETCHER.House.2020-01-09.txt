 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 535, the PFAS  Action Act, a comprehensive bill to address PFAS contamination across  the country. And I thank my colleagues for their commitment to bringing  this bill to the floor.   Mr. Chair, I am glad that one of the bills I filed in this Congress,  H.R. 2638, has now been included in this legislation. It directs the  Environmental Protection Agency to issue guidance on minimizing the use  of firefighting foam and other equipment that contains PFAS chemicals  by firefighters and first responders.   Its purpose is simply to minimize the risk for our firefighters and  first responders as well as for our environment. We know that these  chemicals are dangerous for humans who have been exposed to them, and  we know they are dangerous for our environment.   Unfortunately, we have seen the impacts in our community as recently  as last year. During the ITC plant fire in Deer Park, Texas, in March  2019, firefighters used more than 130,000 gallons of foam to extinguish  the massive flames in that fire. Not long after, high levels of PFAS  chemicals were found in the water in the Houston Ship Channel and lower  levels were found farther downstream, according to the Galveston Bay  Foundation.   Our first responders risk their lives every day to protect our  communities. We must do everything we can to protect theirs.
