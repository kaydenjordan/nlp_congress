 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding, and I appreciate her courtesy. I did ask my side for time.  Unfortunately, they had no time available, so I thank the gentlewoman  for coming to my rescue on this.   I feel very strongly about this, and I echo the comments of Mr.  LoBiondo. The premium increase here can have a devastating impact on my  constituents. Without grandfathering, we would see premiums skyrocket.  And when Mr. LoBiondo and I tried to ameliorate this by suggesting a  compromise by putting a $5,000 cap on premiums, we were rejected.   When Mr. LoBiondo talked about a bias against the Northeast, that  bias continues today from Sandy. Louisiana, Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico  all received tax relief following their storms. To this day, voters in  my district have not received that tax relief; and Mr. LoBiondo's  district is the same.   So I am also tired of this regional bias. We, in the Northeast, get  treated--whether it is on taxes, or whatever it is, we do not get a  fair shake. Maybe they don't need our votes.   Well, you are not getting my vote today. I urge Members to vote in  opposition.
