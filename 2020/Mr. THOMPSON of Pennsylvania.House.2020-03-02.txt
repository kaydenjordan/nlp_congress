 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  the 75th birthday of Smokey Bear, one of American culture's most  recognizable icons.   For 75 years, Smokey Bear has implored us time and time again to be  [[Page H1435]]  mindful while spending time in the great outdoors and to promote forest  health with his famous slogan, ``Only you can prevent forest fires.''   Smokey has taught countless individuals both young and old about the  importance of personal responsibility for protecting the environment  and our natural resources.   On Smokey's 75th birthday, we should also remember that the best way  to prevent a forest fire is through a well-managed forest. Proper  forest management is not only critical to the health and strength of  the forest industry but essential for a healthy environment and economy  of the rural area, as well.   I think we can all agree that Smokey looks pretty good for 75 and is  working as hard as ever to promote responsible forest stewardship. Here  is to 75 more years of preventing forest fires.                            ____________________
