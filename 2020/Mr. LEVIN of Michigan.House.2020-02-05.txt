 Madam Speaker, during National Gun Violence  Survivors Week, I rise to recognize my State of the Union guest, Mary  Miller-Strobel, from my hometown of Berkley, Michigan.   After her brother, Ben, was honorably discharged from the military,  Mary grew concerned that Ben was at risk of self-harm. Mary and her  father drove to every gun store in their small town, begging them not  to sell Ben a gun. But they had no legal recourse to block a store from  selling Ben the gun that would end his life. Ben died by suicide soon  thereafter.   Had Mary been able to seek an extreme risk protection order, Ben  might still be alive today.   Mary is now a Moms Demand Action leader and has turned her tragedy  into a triumphant story of fighting to prevent other families from  suffering this tremendous and preventable loss.   The House has passed commonsense gun violence legislation, and we  will pass red flag legislation, too. Now, we need the Senate to act,  for Mary and Ben, and for so many others.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about the  Protecting the Right to Organize Act, a crucial piece of legislation  that we will take up tomorrow on the floor of this House. It is so  important that  [[Page H840]]  we take up this bill because the American economy is not working for  most American families.   While corporations and the wealthy continue to capture the rewards of  a growing economy, working families and middle class Americans are  being left behind. From 1980 to 2017, average incomes for the bottom 90  percent of households increased just 1.1 percent, while average incomes  for the wealthiest 1 percent increased by 184 percent.   This inequality is not a natural product of a functioning economy. It  is not all due to globalization or technology change. It is the result  of policy choices that have stripped workers of the power to join  together and negotiate for decent wages, benefits, and working  conditions.   The Protecting the Right to Organize Act restores fairness to the  economy by strengthening the Federal laws that protect workers' rights  to form a union.   You know, our basic labor law, the National Labor Relations Act was  passed 85 years ago in 1935. It was a core part of the New Deal. A lot  of credit is due to the man for whom it is named, Senator Wagner of New  York. Also, in addition to FDR, our President, our amazing Secretary of  Labor, Frances Perkins deserves of a huge amount of credit.   And after the Wagner Act was passed, or the National Labor Relations  Act in 1935, within just 12 years, one-third of American workers were  members of unions. And that figure, about a third of all workers being  in unions, persisted for some time. But then employers went on the  attack to try to undermine that law.   In 1947, over President Truman's veto, the Taft Hartley amendments  were passed, and they gutted a lot of what workers wanted in 1935. And  then in 1959, the Landrum-Griffin amendments were passed in the  Eisenhower era, and they further eroded workers' rights.   So that while a third of workers were union members in the late 1940s  and early 1950s, by the time that I started organizing workers in 1983,  about 16\1/2\ percent of private sector workers were in unions. And  today, in 2020, just 6.2 percent of workers in the private sector in  our country have the voice and power of a union. And this has decimated  the American middle class. And it has made the American Dream recede  from view for so many American workers.   So we are going to spend some time tonight talking about the PRO Act,  and I want to invite my esteemed colleague from the great State of  Minnesota, Representative Omar, to join me in saying a few words about  the PRO Act.   Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Minnesota such time as  she may consume.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Omar for  being such a champion of workers in Minnesota and throughout this great  Nation and, indeed, throughout our world.   Madam Speaker, I will take a few moments to talk about the breadth of  this bill.   What has happened to workers in this country over the last several  decades is the result of many administrative actions by various  administrations, regulatory actions that administrations have taken  that stripped workers of their rights, judicial decisions from the  lower courts all the way up to the Supreme Court, and laws passed by  the Congress and the States, to the point where millions and millions  of workers aren't even covered by the National Labor Relations Act,  can't even exercise their rights under the National Labor Relations  Act, and the rights that they have are so badly eroded that,  functionally, workers don't have the freedom to form unions in this  country.   And Representative Omar referenced Chairman Scott. Chairman Scott and  the staff of this committee have done such an incredible job at looking  at the complexity of the workplace in 2020 and including the many ways  in which we need to make changes to help workers.   I want to highlight several things: The first is the problem of  multiple employers and protecting employees of multiple employers.   The PRO Act will make it so that two or more persons are employers  under the National Labor Relations Act, if each codetermines or shares  control over the employees' essential terms and conditions of  employment. It basically codifies the joint employer standard in the  NLRB's Browning-Ferris decision of 2015. And this is extremely  important because in a lot of industries, employers have tried to evade  their responsibility to workers under the National Labor Relations Act  through various schemes of corporate organization so that the company  that really is in charge, that really determines what uniform they  wear, what route they drive, what kind of products they serve,  everything about their job, is not considered an employer under the  act.   The PRO Act will fix that, and it is very important to help millions  of workers get their rights under the NLRA.   Another huge problem of excluding workers from accessing their rights  is misclassification of workers as independent contractors.   The PRO Act will fix this problem by using a simple three-part test  to determine whether someone is an employee or an independent  contractor. And this will help, again, another set of millions of  workers gain access to their rights and clarify that they are covered  as workers, as employees under the National Labor Relations Act. So  they can form a union, bargain collectively, get a contract, and get  justice.   Another major area of the law involves protecting workers in their  right to engage in protected activities. So let's talk about workers  going on strike.   The PRO Act will prohibit employers from permanently replacing  workers who go on strike. This is hugely important, because permanent  replacement of strikers has been a tactic used over the last, really,  40 years to deter workers from engaging in strikes at all and taking  away this very core right of withholding your labor as a way to try to  get better working conditions.   I remember what happened in, for example, the meat packing industry,  which used to be a largely unionized industry. And the workers'  organizations were largely destroyed by preventing workers from  engaging in strikes, to the point where their wages and benefits were  cut massively and many of their facilities were moved, and they  couldn't do anything about it.   Another thing that the PRO Act will do is prohibit offensive  lockouts. Under current law, employers may offensively  [[Page H841]]  lock out employees in the absence of a threatened strike with the goal  of the employer being to curtail the workers' ability to strike by  removing workers control over the timing and duration of a work  stoppage.   Current law also permits employers to hire temporary replacements  during an offensive lockout. So if the employer thinks there might be a  labor dispute, even if the workers hadn't planned to go on strike, they  lock the workers out and temporarily replace them, stripping them of  their ability to make their own strategy about how they want to enforce  their right under the act.   The PRO Act prohibits any lockouts prior to strike but it maintains  employers' rights to respond to strikes with defensive lockouts, which  is appropriate.   Another key change that the PRO Act would put into law after all  these years from the Taft-Hartley amendments is removing limitations on  secondary strikes. The idea here is that the Congress in 1947 said that  workers of one company can't engage in collective activity in  solidarity with workers in another company.   Workers might picket or strike or support a boycott in solidarity  with other workers to improve the other workers on their own, perhaps,  wages and working conditions.                                time  1845    Being allowed to protest however you want in America about what some  other company might be doing is a fundamental First Amendment right.   This has been something that has bothered me for decades. It is  fundamentally unfair in this country, and the PRO Act would fix this by  allowing workers to have their full freedoms to engage in secondary  activity.   A crucial thing that the PRO Act would do to help workers vindicate  their rights under the National Labor Relations Act is prohibiting  captive audience meetings.   So it is hard for people who haven't been through a union organizing  campaign to really understand how absurd it is to claim that a union  election is sort of just like a political election, where you go down  to the local school or church or wherever you vote, and you get in line  and they check whether you are on the voting rolls, and you cast your  ballot in a little booth. You wouldn't dream of putting your job at  risk or that anybody could do something to you for how you vote in  America; it is a core thing.   That is not how it works in a union election. And one of the things  that employers have been allowed to do is they can force you to attend  a meeting, the sole purpose of which is to pressure you not to vote for  a union. They can do that every time you go to work. They can do it for  your whole shift.   If you say, ``I have been to five of your presentations about the  union; I don't want to go anymore,'' you can be fired for not going to  the employer's propaganda offensive against forming a union. It is  something, without parallel, in American law and in our economy only to  prohibit or try to prevent workers from forming a union.   So the PRO Act will change this at long last and say that people have  their First Amendment rights, we are all grownups here, and your  employer cannot make you go to an antiunion captive audience meeting on  pain of termination.   I am sorry it took until 2020 for us to get to this point, but at  long last we are saying captive audience meetings have no place in  workers' decisions about forming unions.   There are a lot of other really important provisions I want to get  to, but at this time I want to invite my esteemed colleague from the  great State of Massachusetts, Representative Ayanna Pressley, to join  in this discussion of why it is so important that we pass the  Protecting the Right to Organize Act.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.  Pressley).    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Pressley  for being such a great champion for workers in Massachusetts and in our  whole country.   Madam Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky).    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative  Schakowsky for her words. I am so glad she shared that story from  Loyola. It reminds me of another situation of graduate employees that  many of us, our colleagues, are working on right now.   Graduate employees of Harvard, in all kinds of labs, in the social  sciences and in the arts, all the different departments, formed a union  and were recognized something like 18 months ago by the Harvard  administration, but they have never achieved a first contract.   I think something like over 20 colleagues joined me in sending a  letter to the president of Harvard University, 20-some of us who are  graduates. I am a graduate of Harvard Law School, and other people are  graduates from the law school, undergraduates from Harvard University,  the Kennedy School, doctors, whatever.   We all sent a letter to President Bacow saying we are happy that you  recognized the union, but unless workers get a first contract, what  have they really achieved? And we hope that both sides will come  together and achieve a first contract. We continue to watch that  situation.   So graduate employees, like others, need the freedom and the ability  to form unions.   I want to hit on a few other areas that the PRO Act deals with, and  my theme tonight really is what a comprehensive jobs bill does in  trying to fix problems that prevent workers from exercising their  rights.                                time  1900    Here is another one. The PRO Act will eliminate employers' ability to  unilaterally withdraw recognition from a union. Now, this is problem  created more recently.   On July 3, 2019, the Trump NLRB issued a decision in Johnson  Controls, Incorporated that would allow an employer to announce that it  will withdraw recognition of a union within a 90-day timeframe before  the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, based on its own  idea that the union has lost majority support. This is just such a good  example of what has happened over and over with workers' rights being  chipped away at.   And so the PRO Act would overturn this decision and prohibit  employers from unilaterally withdrawing recognition of a union, unless  there is an election to decertify the union; just like the workers  would have gone through an election to create the union in the first  place.   Speaking of first contracts, almost half the time when workers  organize in this country, they don't have a first contract within a  year or two. And if you don't have a contract by then, you are not  likely ever to get one. If you can't bargain collectively, what have  you really accomplished by winning a union election?   So it is really crucial that we have first contracts. The PRO Act  fixes this problem. It basically sets up a system of mediation and  arbitration to ensure workers get a contract. It goes like this: Upon a  written request from the union, they have to commence bargaining in 10  days.   If, within 90 days, they haven't achieved a first contract, either  party can request mediation. After 30 days of mediation, if there isn't  a first contract, the case will be referred to arbitration; and the  arbitration panel must be established within 14 days. And there are  sensible procedures about a three-person arbitration panel, fairly  picked, with each side picking one and then agreeing on the third.   Bottom line here: In 144 days, 7\1/2\ weeks from when the election is  decided and the union is certified, there will be arbitration. There is  no timeline for a decision, but that is reasonable because the  arbitrators do this as a profession; they know how to do it; and I  think we can count on them to be timely. And the decision of the  arbitrators is binding for 2 years.   So bottom line, if the company doesn't want to negotiate, if the  workers are having a hard time getting the company to the table, they  can go to mediation and arbitration, and in 7\1/2\ weeks, they can have  an arbitration panel hearing their case. It's a complete sea change  from today, and very important.   Another right that workers have been denied is the right to  collective action in the courtroom, to sue their employer, to go to  court to vindicate their rights.   The NLRA protects workers' rights to engage in concerted activities  for the purpose of mutual aid and protection. It is that broad.   But, on May 21, 2018, the Supreme Court held in Epic Systems  Corporation v. Lewis that, despite this explicit protection, employers  may force workers into signing arbitration agreements that waive the  right to pursue work litigation jointly, collectively, or in a class  action, despite the specific language of the NLRA.   So, the PRO Act would overturn that decision by explicitly stating  that employers may not require employees to waive their rights to  collective action in the courtroom, including class action litigation.   I started organizing unions in 1983, and I remember learning about  the Excelsior list; the list that employers have to provide unions so  that they can know who the workers are and help them organize the  union. You can only get this list after you have a showing of interest  required under the act, so there is a whole process for this.   But the lists we got were often garbage. They were wrong. They would  only have a person's first name or last name. They didn't have the  information required.   So the National Labor Relations Board decided in 2014 that there has  to be certain information in a list, and it has to be searchable in  electronic format; very common sense. Employee's full name, their home  address, work location, shift, job classification and, if the employer  has it, their land line and  [[Page H843]]  mobile telephone numbers and email addresses.   What is the context here?   I can tell you from personal experience, when we talk about workers  having the right to organize, they don't actually have the right to  have access to union organizers in their workplace.   When I was organizing for SEIU, and in the 11 years I served as the  assistant director of organizing at the national AFL-CIO, if we were  helping workers at a facility organize and we walked on to that  property, the employer would arrest us for trespassing.   Workers in the United States have no right to actually have access to  unions in their workplace; so their only way to talk to representatives  of the union is on the phone, or email, or at their homes. So the PRO  Act makes clear that those lists have to be adequate, it's another  thing that may seem small; but if we fix it, we are going to help a lot  more workers exercise their rights.   Another thing that happens very often is that employers gerrymander  the bargaining unit that the National Labor Relations Board finds in  which to hold an election.   So the PRO Act codifies the National Labor Relations Board's 2011  decision in Specialty Healthcare, and prevents employers from doing  this gerrymandering; prevents them from including individuals in the  voting unit who have no interest in joining the union, but they are  simply put there to try to pad the ``no'' vote to prevent the workers  from succeeding in forming a union.   Another thing about union elections that are different from any  normal election in a democracy is the workers usually vote in their  workplace after an intense campaign from their employer to try to stop  them from forming a union.   So the PRO Act enables the board to hold union representation  elections electronically, through certified mail, or off-site, at a  neutral location, to ensure that the employees can cast their ballots  in a neutral, non-coercive environment.    It may seem incredibly basic in any election, but I am telling you,  for the last 50 years, all union elections have taken place under  physical conditions of pressure and coercion in an employer's  workplace, almost all of them.   A related matter that, again, seems shocking to many; if you took a  civics class or any class about government or American history and you  learned how elections are supposed to take place, this is a unique  aspect.   In a union election, where it is just supposed to be workers deciding  whether or not they want to form a union, under our system, the  employer has been a party to the election. The workers file a petition.  The employer is deemed a party, and then they get to engage in  litigation, delay, in order to advance their interest, which always is  to stop their workers from forming a union.   So the PRO Act says no more. We are not having outside entities  interfering with employees' decisions about whether to join a union or  not join a union. It is just up to the workers.   This would harmonize the NLRB's procedures with those of the National  Mediation Board under the Railway Labor Act, which governs labor  relations for railways and airlines and in this area it works much  better.   Another question is: What do you do if an employer is found to have  systematically interfered with the workers' right to form a union?   What has happened regularly is the employer does anything to destroy  a majority who may have signed cards seeking union representation,  which leads to the election, and to get the workers to vote ``no'' even  if a majority of them signed union cards.   A showing of interest to obtain an election for workers doesn't  require a majority. It requires, I think, 30 percent.   But what the PRO Act says is, if a majority of people said they  wanted to have a union, an absolute majority, they signed authorization  cards, and then the employer set about and destroyed the majority  through means that the National Labor Relations Board determined were  illegal, the NLRB has a remedy that it shall issue an order requiring  the employer to bargain, taking away the incentive and the ability of  employers to destroy workers' majorities through illegal activities.   Another area that has been so lacking in our labor laws has to do  with penalties. And again, if you are a civil rights lawyer or activist  concerned with women's rights, or the rights of religious minorities,  or the rights of racial minorities, you wouldn't believe this: In all  other areas of civil rights laws, laws protecting rights of Americans,  there are various forms of penalties to try to disincentivize violating  American's rights; pain and suffering, treble damages, different--it  depends on the statute and the area.   Here is the way it works under the National Labor Relations Act. If I  am fired for trying to form a union, and the employer does it totally  on purpose, just to destroy, scare everybody else, they succeed in  killing the union drive, that was their goal; and there is litigation,  the union backs me up. If, 3 years later, a judge finds they absolutely  fired you for union activity, they violated your rights, you are right,  you get your remedy. The remedy is this: Single back pay minus anything  you made in the meantime. It is shocking.   Working people aren't going to stop working in the hopes that someday  they will be found to have had their rights violated. They have to feed  their family. So employers basically have gotten away with violating  people's rights, and the penalty has been, often, virtually nothing.   So under the PRO Act, if an employee has been discharged or suffered  serious economic harm in violation of the act, now the NLRB will award  back pay, without any reduction, front pay, consequential damages, and  an additional amount as liquidated damages equal to two times the  amount of damages awarded, which is, essentially, the normal kind of  punitive damages awarded in this kind of case, to incentivize the  employers not to violate the law.   Also, the workers cannot have their relief denied if they are an  undocumented worker.   So let me just mention one other area where this law will help  workers so much; just to vindicate their basic right of association and  speech in the workplace, to come together and form a union and bargain  collectively. It refers to the same situation I just mentioned.   If they fire you for trying to form a union, what happens?   Their principal motive really isn't about you as an individual. It is  about the group. They are trying to scare you out of forming a union.                                time  1915    They will fire the ringleaders. They will fire one, five, however  many people they think are necessary to basically have the workers fear  moving forward to vindicate their rights.   Often in these cases, the courts ultimately may determine 6 months, 1  year, 5 years later that you were fired for union activity, but the  union drive was killed long ago. It is immediate. It was killed within  a day or weeks.   So the PRO Act requires the NLRB to seek temporary injunctive relief  whenever there is reasonable cause to believe that an employer  unlawfully terminated an employee or significantly interfered with  employees' rights under the NLRA. And the district court is directed to  grant temporary relief for the duration of the NLRB proceedings.   Essentially, they are saying: I am firing you because you did  something wrong on the job. That can be determined after the election,  but we are not going to let employers fire workers to scare their  coworkers out of exercising their rights.   Madam Speaker, these are just a few of the ways that the PRO Act will  help American workers at long last exercise their freedom to form  unions and bargain collectively. I am telling you, we have passed so  much legislation that would help American workers and their families,  the Raise the Wage Act, protection for people with preexisting  conditions, lowering prescription drug costs, but there is no bill that  comes close to this one and the impact it could have on American  families and workers.   MIT did a study, and it found that just under half of nonunion  workers say they would like to form a union if they just had the  freedom to do it. Gallup every year studies people's attitudes toward  unions. They have been  [[Page H844]]  doing this the same way for decades. They found the highest approval  rating of unions in decades, yet just 6 percent of private-sector  workers have unions.   If workers were free to form unions in this country, and not half of  all nonunion workers but just a fraction of them so we got back up to  say a third of workers being in unions in this country again, our  economy would be completely transformed because when workers form  unions it is not just they themselves who benefit. Other employers  raise their wages to compete to attract workers or to try to get their  workers not to form a union. That is fine. It benefits all workers in  this country. It benefits their children and their communities.   It is just an honor to be here to talk about the PRO Act. I am really  proud of being one of Chairman Scott's lieutenants in this effort.  Tomorrow, we are going to pass this legislation and give a leg up to  all the working people in this country who just want to get their  little piece of the American Dream.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
