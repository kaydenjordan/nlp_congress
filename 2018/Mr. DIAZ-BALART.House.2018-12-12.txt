 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mention a few words in  honor of my dear friend and colleague Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the first  Hispanic woman elected to the Florida House in 1982, the Florida Senate  in 1986, and to this body in 1989.   It has been a privilege working with her on issues that are important  to our south Florida community and to our country, as well as on  foreign policy issues, Mr. Speaker, where she fought on behalf of those  struggling for democracy around the planet in places such as Communist  China, North Korea, Iran, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba.   She worked to combat anti-Semitism and protect the rights of  Holocaust victims, while ensuring that those complicit were held  accountable.   I will miss her exuberant presence in this Chamber. There will never  be another Member to serve with her joyful dedication, wit, and  contagious enthusiasm.   Chairwoman Emeritus Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and her husband, Dexter, have  served our community and our country with honor and distinction. While  we will miss her here in Congress, I am blessed to know that I will  still always be able to rely on her counsel, her support, her love, and  her friendship.   (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)        My legislative sister, lleana Ros-Lehtinen, thank you for       everything that you have done for our community, for our       country, and for our cause, lleana, we love you.         Mi hermana legislativa, lleana Ros-Lehtinen, gracias por       todo que has hecho por nuestra comunidad, por nuestro pais, y       por nuestra causa. lleana, te queremos.                            ____________________
