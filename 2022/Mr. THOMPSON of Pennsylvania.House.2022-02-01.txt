 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Forest County Sheriff Bob Wolfgang on his retirement.   Sheriff Wolfgang was first elected sheriff in 2001 and proceeded to  spend two decades as the Forest County sheriff. In his work as sheriff,  Bob aimed to engage the community and help people turn their lives  around.   During his five terms, Sheriff Wolfgang and his office worked to  overhaul conceal carry permits, improve security, and start several  programs aimed to engage the county's youth.   From participating in ``Shop with a Cop'' to a Forest County Youth  Field Day, Sheriff Wolfgang focused on working with children to improve  relationships with police and the community. He also spent time raising  awareness for scams targeting senior citizens.   Sheriff Wolfgang always focused on helping the community and being a  positive role model for other officers and Forest County residents. His  impact on all of our community cannot be overstated.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Sheriff Wolfgang for his dedication and service  to Forest County and the region. May he enjoy his retirement. He  deserves it.                            ____________________
