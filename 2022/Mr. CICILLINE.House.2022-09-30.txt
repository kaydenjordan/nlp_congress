 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this  continuing resolution.   In addition to averting a disastrous government shutdown, this  legislation provides critical funding to continue our support for  Ukraine, resettle Afghan refugees, support communities impacted by  natural disasters, and help low-income families heat their homes this  winter.   However, we still have work to do as this package lacks funding to  support our public health response to COVID-19 and monkeypox, also  known as MPV.   Our public health workforce is depleted and exhausted from battling  the COVID-19 pandemic over the last 2 years. They cannot stop the  spread of these outbreaks without additional Federal support.   Both viruses disproportionately impact low-income communities and  communities of color. Congressional inaction will deepen these  disparities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote today to avert a government  shutdown and then join us in working on long-term funding bills that  address these public health crises and the other priorities of the  American people.   I want to end by thanking the extraordinary chairwoman of the  Committee on Appropriations, Rosa DeLauro, for her leadership in  negotiating today's legislation and thanking her for all she has done.
