The Senator from Oklahoma.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, constituents of mine are hearing today  that there is a looming government shutdown--Friday at midnight; that  if Congress hasn't passed a spending bill, it is possible the  government could shut down. That would be a big mistake. Government  shutdowns do not make sense.   We have legislation called End Government Shutdowns, by the way,  which says that when Congress doesn't do their appropriations bills on  time--which is never or rarely--that there should not be a shutdown;  rather, continue the spending from the previous year, but ratchet it  down over time to give the Appropriations Committee and Congress and  the Senate an incentive to get the job done. But let's not shut down  the government. When we do that, it doesn't help anybody. It doesn't  help us as taxpayers because we end up coming back and paying people,  and the inefficiencies of it create more costs. So I hope we are not  even talking about that.   In the so-called continuing resolution, which is a short-term  spending bill--which, again, is not the best way to govern, but that is  what our choice is--in that continuing resolution to keep the  government from shutting down, there is also, as I understand it, going  to be something that is very good for our country. So, one, shutting  down doesn't make sense, but two, let's be sure that the short-term  spending bill that we do pass includes something very important-- important to about 219,000 children in my home State of Ohio and  millions of families around the country who depend on a program called  the Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP.   CHIP has traditionally been a bipartisan program. It is supported by  Democrats and Republicans alike. In fact, the reauthorization of the  Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, came out of the Finance  Committee with a vote that was unanimous--Republicans and Democrats  alike. Again, that doesn't happen often. It happened because people  believe it is important to have that safety net program for our kids  and for those families.   Right now, that program is really on life support. We are told that  if we do not extend that program, some States will begin running out of  money even in the next few weeks. One of those States could be Ohio, we  are told. The numbers are not exactly accurate, I don't think, because  nobody knows. That makes it very unpredictable and uncertain for those  families and children. We know there are States running out of money  right now.   By the way, the program ended in September, and since September 30,  it has been given these short-term authorizations. That doesn't make  sense.   My understanding is that the House of Representatives is going to  actually put into the continuing resolution that they are going to send  over here a longer term extension of the Children's Health Insurance  Program--in fact, a  [[Page S278]]  6-year extension, which would be the longest extension ever. I think  that is very important.   I heard from some families last week in Ohio who are wondering: Are  you guys going to actually provide us with the certainty that our kids  can continue to receive the treatment they are getting?   These are children who have serious health problems and who need that  kind of care and rely on CHIP to provide it.   For all the disagreements we have in this Chamber--and there are  plenty of them--there will be healthy and spirited debate on lots of  issues later today, I am sure. This is one on which we can come  together and agree that children should have that basic healthcare.   I came to the Senate floor last month--back in December--to strongly  urge my colleagues and the leadership on both sides of the aisle to  take the politics out of this and get CHIP done, get the long-term  authorization done, in the last spending bill. That was not done. In  fact, it was just a short-term extension of CHIP that basically  coincides with the spending bills. That was disappointing. I said so at  the time. It was not done last time. That was a mistake. Now we have  the opportunity to do it. Let's take that opportunity. I am here to  once again say, let's act to provide that long-term stability in the  program.   Again, I am encouraged by what I hear--that the House of  Representatives is likely to include that stability to ensure that  children everywhere can receive adequate and affordable healthcare. The  House 6-year extension would also return CHIP to a traditional Federal- State partnership, which has been a bipartisan effort, and provide  additional protections for low-income children and more flexibility for  the States.   There are some changes to the program and some reforms to the program  that have been bipartisan through committee, and I am hopeful that will  be part of it as well.   The House bill that includes this CHIP extension--it would be the  longest extension since the creation of the program more than 20 years  ago. Instead of these short-term ones, we are going to have a long-term  extension, if we can pass this. By doing it long term, the  Congressional Budget Office says we will actually save taxpayers $1  billion. Having that predictability and certainty--not having the  start-and-stop nature of CHIP--saves taxpayers money.   Is this CR perfect in terms of healthcare? No. There are other things  we should do as well. We can do that with regard to the longer term  spending bill we will probably be doing a couple of weeks from now or a  few weeks from now or whenever we come to the end of whatever the  continuing resolution is tomorrow.   We do need to find long-term funding solutions for community health  centers, for instance. Again, that has been bipartisan in the past.  These centers have been very effective in dealing with issues that  relate to our communities, health issues, such as opioid addiction.  Community health centers have been very helpful in providing treatment  to people, particularly in rural areas that don't have access to other  healthcare treatment centers. We should provide them with that long- term funding and certainty.   I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will vote to  extend these important health insurance programs for our children.  Again, CHIP stands for Children's Health Insurance Program. It should  not be a bargaining chip for other political purposes. Let's get that  done. This is a chance for everybody to ensure that we have that  certainty for our children and help them to live up to their God-given  potential in life.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to talk about another vulnerable  group of Americans. This is an issue that doesn't relate to the looming  government shutdown or the spending bill that will avoid that shutdown,  but it relates to another issue that Congress has the opportunity to  address this month.   January is Human Trafficking Prevention Month. Last Thursday was  National Human Trafficking Awareness Day. We had a lot of people here  in town talking about that issue.   I think everybody in this Chamber would agree with me that we live in  a great country. We are blessed to be Americans. In this age of rapid  scientific, medical, and technological innovation, we have been able to  change the world in positive ways. That is good. But something else is  happening that is discouraging; that is, in this country, in the 21st  century, we are actually seeing an increase in a part of human  trafficking, and that is heartbreaking. This is sex trafficking that is  occurring in our country. Often it involves children, underage, who are  being sold much like property. Experts tell us that this increase is  happening primarily for one reason and one reason alone, and that is  because of the internet. It is sort of the dark side of the internet.  It is a ruthlessly efficient way to conduct this trafficking business.   This is a stain on our national character. It is something we should  all be involved with, Republican and Democrat alike, all of us as  Americans, to say: Let's push back. Let's not allow our country, during  this period of so many positive technological changes, to use this  technology--in this case, online websites selling people--in a way that  devastates these families and creates so many dislocations in our  communities. Traffickers are using the internet because of the fact  that Congress--the House and the Senate--passed legislation 21 years  ago that they are able to hide behind. They have immunity under the  Federal law called the Communications Decency Act. Ironically, it was  actually put in place to push back against child pornography--in other  words, to protect children from viewing pornography. It is being used  now to say: Well, we don't have responsibilities as websites even if we  knowingly are selling children online. Can you imagine that?   Our legislation to deal with that is something we have been working  on for a couple of years. We had a 2-year investigation on this online  trafficking. It focused a lot on one website--an evil website that  sells people online and knowingly has been providing ads out there for  underage girls and boys--backpage.com. As we looked into it and did  more research, it became clear that even though they were doing this  and even though there were people suing them because of it, none of the  lawsuits were successful--whether from prosecutors or victims, whether  criminal suits or civil suits--because of this immunity they were  claiming under Federal law.   We found out that backpage.com--this one website--was responsible for  about 75 percent of all child trafficking reports that the National  Center for Missing and Exploited Children was receiving. In other  words, the great majority of this was happening on this one website. We  found out there has been a dramatic increase in trafficking because of  this ruthless online efficiency.   When we got through our investigation, we also found out that this  website actually knew that some of these ads were related to children  and yet published them anyway. They went so far as to try to, as they  called it, ``clean'' the ads for illegal transactions. Someone would  place an ad, pay for the ad, and then backpage would say: You need to  change this ad a little bit because you are using words like  ``schoolgirl'' or ``cheerleader,'' which indicates they are underage.   In other words, they knew these kids were underage. Yet they edited  the ads and placed the ads anyway and took the profit. That is what we  are up against.   The cost to these families, the human suffering that results from  this, is incalculable. I met with victims all around the State of Ohio  and some from other States who have come here, as they did last week  for this rally. Can you imagine being in that situation as a parent?   Kubiiki Pride, who was here last week, had her 14-year-old daughter  go missing. She was a teenager. Her mom was stricken with grief and  concern over her. After 10 weeks, she couldn't find her anywhere.  Finally, somebody said: You ought to look on this website called  backpage because they are selling girls online. God forbid, they were  right, and she found her daughter. She  [[Page S279]]  found several photographs of her daughter--not photographs she wanted  to see, but on the other hand, there was her daughter alive. She said:  My first reaction was relief that she was alive. Then, of course, I  called backpage, and I said: I found my daughter. She is on your site.  She is 14 years old. Please take her ad down.   Backpage said: Did you pay for the ad?   She said: No, I didn't pay for the ad. That is my daughter. She is 14  years old.   They said: No, we can't take down the ad. You didn't pay for it.   Can you imagine?   She was eventually reunited with her daughter. And there is a film  called ``I am Jane Doe'' in which she and other women, mothers and  young women, are featured. You can see more about her story and what a  brave woman she is because she is now standing up to it. She filed a  lawsuit, but the lawsuit was not successful because the judge said  there is this immunity.   By the way, the courts that have ruled that these websites are  protected by this Federal law have said that Congress ought to do  something about that. Most recently, last August, a Sacramento judge  dropped charges against backpage, stating: ``If and until Congress sees  fit to amend the immunity law, the broad reach of section 230 of the  Communications Decency Act even applies to those alleged to support the  exploitation of others by human trafficking.''    To me that is an invitation for Congress to act, saying: We get it;  they are exploiting human beings online, but this Federal law gives  them immunity.   This immunity was put in place 21 years ago in an effort to try to  ensure that we could have a free internet, and that is very important,  but it was never intended to provide immunity to illegal activity like  this--certainly not to keep people in the business of sex trafficking.   That injustice is why we introduced our legislation. It is called the  Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, or SESTA. I introduced it with  Senators Blumenthal, McCain, McCaskill, Cornyn, Heitkamp, and others.  Senators Thune and Nelson took this bill through the Commerce Committee  late last year.   We had a spirited debate in that committee, and it ended up coming  out of the committee with a unanimous vote. Why? Because after hearing  from the victims, after hearing from the experts on both sides, the  Senators said: Whoa. This doesn't make any sense. As Senators, it is  our responsibility to change this law.   It provides justice for victims of online sex trafficking because  they will have the opportunity to sue. It holds these websites  accountable that knowingly facilitate crimes. It also helps in terms of  prosecutions because the State prosecutors now--the AGs, the local  prosecutors at the State level--will be able to have access now to the  courts to be able to take on these websites and, again, hold them  accountable. The prosecutions, again, have been thwarted because of  this immunity.   These are very narrow changes. They don't affect the freedom of the  internet at all. In fact, I would argue it helps to ensure a free  internet. To take care of these bad actors and by holding these folks  accountable, it is going to provide the justice the victims deserve.   It is a fair and commonsense approach, and that is why it has the  support not just of the Members I have mentioned but actually, now, 66  or 67 Members of the U.S. Senate. That is out of 100 Members. That is a  rare thing to have that kind of support. It has the majority of the  Republicans on board. It has the majority of the Democrats on board.   It is a fair and commonsense approach that is going to make a real  difference in the lives of the people we represent. It will be  effective at curbing this increase in trafficking that we see online.  Every day we don't act, there are more women and more children who are  being trafficked unnecessarily.   It also has the support of an extraordinary coalition of law  enforcement organizations, anti-trafficking advocates, survivors,  faith-based groups, civil rights communities, major businesses, and  even some members of the tech community that initially pushed back  against this legislation. Looking at it, I think many of them realized  this is not a defensible position to say we shouldn't amend this  Federal law that is providing immunity to these bad actors.   Members of the U.S. Senate who have cosponsored the bill, including  colleagues of mine who are in the Senate Chamber this afternoon, are  saying: I want to be part of the solution. They are showing some  courage, and I appreciate that. People who have really shown courage  are these survivors--these children and these women who have been  trafficked--and they need our help.   We need 60 votes to pass most things around here. In this case, we  will have some objections, apparently, and so having 66 or 67  supporters of this legislation is a key number. It enables us to ensure  that we can get this onto the floor and passed on the floor. So why are  we waiting? We shouldn't wait. We should move this month, during Human  Trafficking Awareness Month, Human Trafficking Prevention Month. We  should move because it is the right thing to do for these victims and  those who might be victims between now and when we act. It is the right  thing to do because it will create a safer and a better and a more just  society. Elected officials like us are elected to do just that.   There were hundreds of sex trafficking survivors on Capitol Hill last  week, and I met with them. The stories will break your heart. Some were  the parents, some were trafficking victims themselves. They have shown  great courage by sharing their stories, bringing their tragedy public,  and now we owe them the opportunity to get this legislation passed, to  ensure that we can protect some of the most vulnerable among us.
