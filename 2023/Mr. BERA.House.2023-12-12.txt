 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the safe, timely,  and sufficient delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians in the Gaza  Strip.   The actions that Hamas took on October 7 were horrific and led to the  tragic loss of life and displacement of millions.   When I talk to the families of victims of the October 7 tragedy who  were killed or taken hostage, you can hear the agony and despair in  their voices. I also hear that same agony and despair when I talk to my  constituents who are Palestinian Americans who have lost relatives in  this war.   Now, I can't change the prosecution of this war. Israel has a right  to defend itself. Israel has a right to make sure Hamas no longer  presents a security threat to its civilians. It also has the right to  degrade Hamas' ability to be a viable governing and political entity if  we ever want to find a lasting peace.   That is the horror of war. I can't prevent that. What we can do is  prevent what we are watching unfold in front of our eyes right now.   I am a doctor, and I am hearing horrific reports of the humanitarian  and public health crisis that is taking place--the lack of clean water,  the lack of food, and the starvation that is unfolding in front of us.  Winter is coming.   We must do everything we can to prevent the humanitarian crisis if we  ever want to find eventual peace in the region. That is something that  we can do. That is not about war. That is about relieving the suffering  of individuals and civilians. The folks who are most vulnerable are  infants and the elderly. Let's get them that clean water.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I am introducing my resolution calling for  the safe, timely, and sufficient delivery of humanitarian aid to  civilians in the Gaza Strip.   This resolution urges the Biden administration to facilitate a scale- up of the safe and continuous flow of aid to civilians that includes  medications, food, and clean water. It asks for the ability of  humanitarian organizations to deliver this aid in Gaza without  impediment or interference. It encourages the distribution of fuel to  humanitarian organizations working in Gaza and for the proper oversight  to ensure the aid is appropriately delivered and not commandeered by  Hamas.   Mr. Speaker, I also recognize the urgency of passing President  Biden's supplemental funding because it does contain funding for  humanitarian aid.   We have to get this done. We must do everything we can to pass this  funding request to support our allies and prevent this humanitarian  catastrophe in Gaza.   Mr. Speaker, in this time when many religions and faiths are  reflective, let's do everything we can. We are all God's children here.   We can do this. This is not about war. This is about saving lives.  This is about allowing humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza on a  continuous basis to provide food, clean water, medications, fuel to  keep hospitals operating, and energy to make sure we save these lives.                            ____________________
