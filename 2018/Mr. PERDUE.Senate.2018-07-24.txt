 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, what we  have here is another distraction from what we in this body need to be  focused on today; that is, funding the Federal Government and  confirming this President's nominees.   Right now, we have just 23 working days, as a result of the way the  Senate operates, between now and the end of the fiscal year--just 23  days. Meanwhile, we have 329 nominees. These are Presidential nominees  waiting for this body to confirm them. We need to stay on track.   This resolution is no more than political theater. This resolution  was previously objected to by Senator Cornyn just last week. It will  continue to be objected to again because it is unnecessary.   The Senate, the House of Representatives, and our intelligence  community have all thoroughly investigated this matter. In fact, the  Senate Intelligence Committee has held 16 open hearings, dating back to  January of 2017. They all found that Russia did, in fact, attempt to  interfere in the U.S. election. We all take that very seriously.   However, let's be crystal clear. They also found there is no evidence  this interference impacted the outcome of the Presidential election in  2016 at all.   This President and this body have consistently been tough on Russia.  I have personally cosponsored strong sanctions on Russia and introduced  legislation condemning Russian military aggression around the world. We  are currently debating additional economic sanctions to hold Russia  further accountable, and we will continue to do so as long as their  nefarious activities continue.   What we don't need are more political distractions, and that is all  this is. Therefore, I object.
