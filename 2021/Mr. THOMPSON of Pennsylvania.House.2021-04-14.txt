 Mr. Speaker, last month, the House  Agriculture Committee hosted its first, or at least more fulsome,  attempt at publicly reviewing the pandemic and Congress' response.   This pandemic has infiltrated our lives in every sense possible.  Unfortunately, the brunt of it was borne by our communities and, in  particular, families already living paycheck to paycheck. In too many  instances, arrogant career politicians issued statewide, indiscriminate  edicts, forcing businesses and schools to shut their doors, plummeting  our communities into a deep recession.   As the end of the pandemic nears, I hope we can use what we learned  in that hearing to provide these families with more holistic services,  particularly as they engage in a postpandemic economy that will look  wildly different.   The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, currently  provides nutrition assistance to 43 million individuals, with an  average individual benefit of $183. Total SNAP-related spending in  fiscal year 2020 was $78.9 billion, which includes benefits,  administration, nutrition education, employment and training, and  program integrity. Of that $78.9 billion, $74.2 billion was solely for  benefits.   By way of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, the  Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, and the  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, more than $37.8 billion has  been appropriated to respond to the supplemental nutrition assistance  needs of our communities.   This monumental response is in addition to the more than $7.7 billion  per month in standard SNAP benefits. Beyond direct funding from  Congress, the former and current administrations have issued more than  4,000 administrative waivers to States. These waivers impact operations  related to program eligibility, distribution of benefits, employment  and training, and more.   These facts are startling. Combined with myriad social service  policies, including those found in the shortsighted, outrageously naive  American Rescue Plan, we are in the midst of our Nation's second- largest expansion of entitlements.   Unsurprisingly, leading economists and Wall Street analysts have said  key parts of that bill are poorly targeted to the specific needs of the  crisis. As a friend in southwest Missouri recently said, unnecessary  rescue diminishes a person's dignity and, if repeated enough, gives way  to debilitating dependency.   The witnesses who joined us for the hearing are our everyday heroes.  They are the folks who responded without hesitation to the needs of  their communities infested by a pandemic that took the lives of  hundreds of thousands of our friends, neighbors, and family members.  Whether it be the farmer who chose to donate their crop or the food  bank that opened additional sites to be more accommodating, the  witnesses who testified deserve our thanks.   I must also applaud the Department, particularly the former  administration. Like it or lump it, the bulk of the  [[Page H1742]]  response originated in the last Congress under President Trump. Quick- thinking folks implemented Pandemic-EBT and the Farmers to Families  Food Box Program, two projects that remain remarkably beneficial to  families in need.   The latter, apparently terminating this morning, as I found out  through the press, fell victim to inconceivable criticism. There is  always room for more solutions to the needs of our Nation.   The Farmers to Families Food Box Program had open eligibility, making  certain anyone and everyone in need, regardless of status, income, or  household size, has supplementary access to meat, dairy, and produce in  an unprecedented time of crisis. This program provided more than 156  million boxes to households across the United States. With this  program, farmers were able to redirect their products, and American  workers were able to sustain their employment or join new ventures, all  to ensure fresh foods found their way into the homes of millions in  need.   Regardless of the cherry-picked hiccups this committee and USDA's  listening sessions were made aware of, the program worked exactly as  intended. Shamefully, and because this was the brainchild of President  Trump, the Biden administration has decided again to ignore rural  America and continue to fund programs that favor billion-dollar  organizations in the cities that they serve.                            ____________________
