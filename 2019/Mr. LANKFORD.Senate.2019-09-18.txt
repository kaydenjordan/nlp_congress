 Mr. President, on September 17, 1787, this great  experiment was finalized to try to form what they considered a more  perfect Union, and the birth of our Constitution happened. This was a  radical experiment in self-government, and most of the rest of the  world at the time stared at those whom we now call our Founding Fathers  and thought, that will never work.   It wasn't a parliamentary system. It wasn't a monarchy. It was a  representative republic, and it was pulling something out of the  thoughts and the hearts of people to say: This is inherently what we  think would work.   It began with the simple concept of checks and balances--that one  person would check another person who would check another person. They  were able to put that into a governmental structure that had three  coequal branches--an executive, a legislative, and judicial branch--so  that we don't have one over the other. The three stand on equal  footing. Each of them watches the other.   It was a unique system of putting a legislative branch together that  had one body made up of the House of Representatives that would be  large, boisterous, and up for election every two years.   The most painful parts of government--that are required of  government--are put into the hands of the people who are closest to the  people. Those are the power of impeachment, the power of the purse, and  the power of things that need to be done by government but can be done  only by people who are closest to the government.   Then they were able to create a Senate with longer terms, closer to  the States, and a larger perspective on how we would structure together  to make sure that we protect the rights of the individual States and  the uniqueness of, at that time, those 13 States all joining together.  It was a radical idea and a complete shift from where we had just been.   As Americans, occasionally we forget that this wasn't our first time  to try to  [[Page S5558]]  put a government together. Prior to 1787, we had Articles of  Confederation that basically had 13 different States that were very  loosely connected to each other, that continued to spar with each  other, and that didn't cooperate together. Eventually, they determined  that we had to do something different.   After our practice round of the Articles of Confederation, we put  together this Constitution. But even after the Constitution was put  into place, when the very first Congress came into session, they  immediately began work on 12 amendments that, at that time, they called  the Bill of Rights. That is right; there were 12 amendments. We are so  used to hearing about the 10 amendments in the Bill of Rights, but they  started with 12. They debated and they edited and they worked it  through, and those 12 ended up becoming 10. Those 10 amendments were  added as our Bill of Rights, but we continue to be able to edit and to  be able to work together as a country.   Eventually, we fought a civil war--one of the most tragic parts of  the entire history of our Nation. Yet this Constitution still kept us  together at the end, and we still function together.   Since the original 10 Bill of Rights, we have added 17 different  amendments to the Constitution. This enduring document, after more than  two centuries, continues to be the foundation of every single law in  the United States. It is unlike many parts of the world even still  today.   In much of the world, they change constitutions every time their  Monarch changes. They change constitutions every time their government  changes. And when an executive branch decides they don't particularly  like what is happening in the legislative branch, they just demand a  new constitution and shift the laws of the entire country.   We don't. We started with a Constitution and started with the simple  principle that the law matters. We continue to build on that basic law.  When our preferences change, the law still exceeds our preferences. And  if there is a change that we need to make in law, we agree together to  make a change in law.   We still continue to respect the uniqueness of, now, all 50 States  and of local authorities. We still have counties and cities and  parishes and municipalities. They oversee school boards. They make day- to-day decisions. They provide local first responders, garbage  collection, recycling, public transportation, parks and recreation.  They manage utilities. They decide street names, deal with local roads,  street signs, and zoning laws. It is all done locally; it is not done  federally. The Federal Government has nothing to do with that.   Then, larger than the local municipalities, we have the States. They  establish local governments. They establish public schools, issue  teaching certificates, and licenses for professionals like doctors,  lawyers, psychiatrists--as many types of professions as they choose.  They decide the time, manner, and places of elections because those are  the responsibilities of the States. They determine motor vehicle  registrations, driver's licenses, marriage licenses, business licenses.  They regulate commerce within their State.   Our simple system is not only broken up into three different branches  of government, but it is also broken up into local governments, State  governments, and unique responsibilities for the Federal Government.  That begins with our national defense, which is uniquely a role that we  can do together as a Federal Government. Then there are interstate  commerce and managing treaties with foreign entities. It is the  responsibility of the larger government.    This unique experiment that was radical in its day is still the envy  of the world to this day, and there is a reason we pause each year in  September and remember Constitution Day.   I think about how often we celebrate the Declaration of Independence  every Fourth of July and think about Thomas Jefferson--his writing and  all of the editing that then happened with his document after he wrote  it. We sometimes lose track of a day in September when we can pause and  think of that second document in our founding after the Declaration-- the U.S. Constitution--that remains the foundation of every law that we  still continue with today. We could not be more grateful for a stable  foundation for our Nation.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the  motion.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 417.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, September 19; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, and the  [[Page S5582]]  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  morning business be closed, and the Senate proceed to executive session  and resume consideration of the McGuire nomination.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:09 p.m., stands adjourned  until Thursday, September 19, 2019, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
