 Madam Speaker, I want to first thank Congressmen Rush and  Davis for allowing us to be here to honor the legacy of Fred Hampton.   Fifty years ago today, a 21-year-old American revolutionary was  murdered in his own home by 14 Chicago police officers who were found  to be colluding with the FBI as part of the COINTELPRO initiative.   Scholars now widely believe that the Hampton death was under the  FBI's initiative. This initiative was a series of covert and often  illegal projects aimed at surveilling, infiltrating, and disrupting  civil rights organizations, feminist organizations, peace activists,  the environmentalist movement, and native groups.   Common tactics used by COINTELPRO were perjury, witness intimidation,  and withholding evidence to falsely imprison and assassinate leaders of  the Panther Party. Among those on the list was the young Fred Hampton.   Fred actively fought against the corruption and injustice Black and  Brown people were being subjected to on a daily basis. He sought to  build a multicultural movement, the Rainbow Coalition, seeking to end  the violence among street gangs.   Let us teach our children and the new generation of his legacy and  fight against racial inequalities, police violence, and mass  incarceration.   Yes, the same problems Black and Brown men and women face today still  continue as they did back then. Today, our criminal justice system and  the failed war on drugs continue to disproportionately impact  communities of color, and it is time we join together to fight  continuously for a more just society.                            ____________________
