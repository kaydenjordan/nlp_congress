 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support  of the Veterans Rapid Retraining Assistance Program Restoration and  Recovery Act. I introduced this bill with Senator Durbin and  Representative Underwood to ensure veterans receive the rapid  retraining benefits they earned.   I thank Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Takano and Subcommittee  on Economic Opportunity Chairman Levin for their leadership in  advancing this bill quickly to meet the urgent need of affected  veterans.   I also thank the multiple veterans' advocates for their support for  swift passage to assist affected students.   Veterans serving our country with honor have earned their rapid  retraining assistance education benefits. The American Rescue Plan  established these benefits, known as VRRAP, to help veterans gain new  skills to meet the changing workforce demands during the pandemic.                                time  1315    Unfortunately, the Veterans Administration lacks the authority to  restore benefits to veterans who attended institutions that closed or  experienced a disapproval of educational programming.   This legislation emerged from casework in Illinois, where more than  300 Illinois veterans were scammed out of their benefits by an  unaccredited for-profit institute.   I am indeed proud to work with Senator Durbin and Representative  Underwood to restore these benefits to these Illinois veterans and  protect any other veteran in similar circumstances.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legislation. I urge my  colleagues to support it, and I thank the Committee on Veterans'  Affairs for bringing it to us so quickly.
