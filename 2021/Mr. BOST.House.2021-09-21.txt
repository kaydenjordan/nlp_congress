 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Speaker, the NDAA is one of the most important bills  Congress passes annually. In fact, the past decade, the NDAA has been  enacted every year. As such, the NDAA often becomes a grab bag for a  variety of priorities. To protect the integrity of this process, I  believe the NDAA should focus on strengthening the Department of  Defense--its systems, its programs, and its personnel. This amendment  would provide an unprecedented $25,000 one-time payment from the VA to  World War II merchant marines. Therefore, we should not be discussing  this proposal as part of the NDAA.   I thank Representative Green for his advocacy on behalf of the  merchant marines, and I support the merchant marines. I am also  grateful for the bravery of these men who served during World War II.  They faced danger, and some made the ultimate sacrifice in service to  our country.   That said, their service has been recognized. The GI Bill Improvement  Act of 1977 provided a pathway to VA care benefits for civilian groups,  known as active duty designees, who supported the Armed Forces in World  War II. The merchant marines are considered active duty designees and,  as such, received veteran status and eligibility for VA benefits  decades ago.   However, this amendment carves out a new benefit for merchant marines  unlike anything Congress has authorized in the past, not even for our  most highly decorated veterans.   I have heard that merchant marines feel they were shortchanged  because they did not receive the GI Bill benefits. However, this bill  creates an inequity among other veterans and active duty designees by  providing a thank-you payment for merchant marines.   Ultimately, this amendment unfairly singles out one group of service  above another. I also have questions about how many merchant marines  would be covered under this amendment and why $25,000 was deemed as the  appropriate amount.   Considering this bill under regular order before the House Committee  of Veterans' Affairs would allow us to ask those questions. It makes  more sense to have it done that way. This is why I cannot support this  amendment's inclusion in the NDAA tonight.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, as I mentioned, this amendment would provide  an unprecedented $25,000 one-time payment for VA World War II merchant  marines. It did not go through regular order. It did not go through the  committee of jurisdiction. This amendment  [[Page H4815]]  should be placed in the committee that has jurisdiction to justify so  that if not only this group but other groups would be able and should  be able to receive benefits, as this amendment requires, we would be  able to do that.   Madam Speaker, I support our merchant marines. I always have. My 20  years in the State legislature, I did just that. As a matter of fact,  at every veteran ceremony, I mentioned and brought up our merchant  marines as our veterans.   That being said, this is not the way to handle this bill. I plead  with the Members of this body not to accept this. I am adamantly  opposed. I would love to take it up in the committee, not in this bill  where it is not the proper place.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  2245
