 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  the Head Start program on its 54th anniversary and the 25th anniversary  of Early Head Start.   I had the proud distinction of serving with Dr. Edward Zigler of Yale  University, who passed away this past year. He was a leader in this and  worked with every President from John Kennedy to Barack Obama.   He is generally regarded as the father of the Head Start program but  also regarded for his longstanding work with children. In fact, it was  Ed Zigler who said, ``My politics are children,'' and then proceeded to  dedicate a lifetime to creating remedies for childcare, which he  labeled, in America, ``a cosmic crapshoot.''   So many young people today experience the dilemma of balancing their  work with bringing up their children. But it was Ed Zigler's leadership  that recognized we should utilize our schools. He promoted School of  the 21st Century as a way for us to get our arms around the whole issue  of having safe, affordable childcare.   I rise today to commemorate his memory and congratulate the Head  Start program.      [[Page H3851]]                                ____________________
