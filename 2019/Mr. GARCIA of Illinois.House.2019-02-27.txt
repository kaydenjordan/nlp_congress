 Madam Speaker, as a Member of the House  representing a district disproportionately affected by gun violence, I  know firsthand the toll that it takes on our community. That is why,  earlier today, I voted on H.R. 8.   Just a year ago last October, a 27-year-old man was killed in a  senseless  [[Page H2266]]  act right in front of my house in Little Village in Chicago. As of  Sunday, our city had witnessed 241 shootings in 2019 so far, including  two in my neighborhood in the last week.   In fact, in Chicago, five of six homicides remain unsolved, but  Chicago has some of the most stringent gun laws in the U.S. What we  need is Federal legislation that makes it harder to access guns.   It is our responsibility to stand up for the safety of our  communities we serve. I am proud to have voted for the passage of the  Bipartisan Background Checks Act moments ago. Tomorrow, we will vote to  close the Charleston loophole, and I urge my Senate colleagues to  advance these efforts immediately.                            ____________________
