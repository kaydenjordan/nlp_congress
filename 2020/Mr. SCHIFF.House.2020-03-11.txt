 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the USA FREEDOM  Reauthorization Act of 2020.   This bill makes a number of critical and important reforms to  strengthen civil liberties and privacy protections under the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act while simultaneously protecting the  national security of the United States. In addition, the bill provides  for greater transparency and increased oversight and accountability to  ensure the integrity of the FISA process.   Over the past several weeks, Chairman Nadler and I, along with  Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer, have worked with Members from  across the caucus and the aisle to develop a set of reforms that our  Democratic Caucus could be proud to support. This bill is a result of  that effort. It builds on the achievements of the USA FREEDOM Act of  2015, which passed with 338 votes in the House and the overwhelming  support of the Democratic Caucus to put in place long-sought reforms to  FISA.   The three expiring provisions that this bill would reauthorize are  vitally important to protecting national security. One of those  measures, the roving wiretap provision, authorizes continued court- approved surveillance of targets, even if they change their phones or  other devices. Its expiration, or that of the other two provisions,  would be to no one's benefit. Our counterterrorism and national  security activities would be severely hamstrung, and we would have lost  the opportunity to press for reforms that we are seeking.   At the outside of this process, administration officials, like the  Attorney General, along with Senate Republican leadership, made it  clear that they preferred a clean and permanent reauthorization of  these authorities. On a bipartisan basis, this bill rejects that  demand, producing a bill that holds firm to our commitment to civil  liberties, oversight, and transparency, and, importantly, has an  important sunset.   Let me describe just a few of the reforms included in this  legislation:   The bill would end, once and for all, NSA's authority to collect call  detail records on an ongoing basis, and destroy all records previously  obtained under these authorities.   This bill would require that the government get a warrant under FISA,  if one would be needed in the law enforcement context.   This bill would prohibit the government from retaining business  records for more than 5 years, with exceptions, such as an imminent  threat to human life.   This bill would expand the appointment of amici in FISA court  proceedings, permit amici to seek access to more information, and  creating a framework for amicus to seek higher court review of  questions of law to the FISA courts.   The bill would also strengthen the requirement for the  declassification and release of FISA court opinions and apply the  requirements retroactively to prior to the enactment of the 2015 USA  FREEDOM Act.   Madam Speaker, I recognize there are additional reforms that Members  would like to see in the bill. I sought additional reforms as well. As  with any negotiation, no one side is getting everything they want, but  I believe it is important to enhance transparency and privacy  safeguards whenever possible.   But this is a strong result that makes substantial reforms that so  many members of our caucus, myself included, have worked hard to secure  for many years. And I will continue to work to secure further  protections for privacy and civil liberties and to provide vigorous  oversight of FISA.   Madam Speaker, I support the bill, which makes important reforms to  the FISA process and urge Members to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Himes).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren).    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I want to, for my Democratic colleagues, provide a reality check on  some of what they have heard during this debate.   It is important to remember that the inspector general report--which,  by the way, doesn't go to the expiring provisions that we are here to  authorize today. But the inspector general report found no evidence of  spying on the Trump campaign.   The inspector general found no evidence of political bias influencing  decisionmaking in the investigation of the Trump campaign and its  connections to Russia during the 2016 election.   The inspector general found that the investigation, in fact, was  properly predicated, that investigation into many of the more than 100  unexplained and often falsely denied contacts between the Trump  campaign and the Russians during the 2016 campaign, including a  notorious secret meeting in Trump Tower between the President's son,  son-in-law, and campaign chairman with a Russian delegation that was  set up by a series of emails in which a Russian delegation offered dirt  on Hillary Clinton to the Trump campaign, and the President's son, on  behalf of that campaign, said that he would love it and set up that  secret meeting. Now, my colleagues don't think that is collusion; the  American people do.   Bob Mueller, for his part, much as his report has been  misrepresented, makes it clear in the very first pages of the report  that he does not address the issues of collusion, only whether he can  prove criminal conspiracy.   So it is important, with that reality check, to once again return to  the bill before us. With respect to the bill before us, we do make  important changes to strengthen the privacy protections, the civil  liberties protections. We also retain the important tools necessary to  help protect the country, the business records provision, the lone-wolf  provision, as well as the roving wiretaps.   The roving wiretap provision, for example, allows the government,  when someone, for example, in the midst of planning a crime of  terrorism uses phones disposably and goes from one phone to another, it  is not necessary to go and get a new warrant every time they change  phones. The warrant can follow the individual rather than the phone.   The business records provision has also been very important in terms  of our efforts at foreign intelligence gathering as well as  counterterrorism. Those authorities would be retained, but new  protections would be put in place such that business records couldn't  be retained more than 5 years unless certain exceptions applied,  protections where, if business records gathered in the FISA context are  used in a criminal proceeding, there is notice given to people that  they are being used in a criminal proceeding.   There is expansion of the amicus authorities so that we have the  amicus  [[Page H1636]]  involved in a broader scope of cases so the court has the advantage of  independent judgment.   Some of those reforms come out of the inspector general's  recommendations and looking into the FISA application involving Carter  Page. Many of those recommendations have nothing to do with Carter Page  and are longstanding interests of the privacy community in trying to  strengthen some of the privacy protections.   I also want to take this opportunity to thank Representative Lofgren  and Representative Jayapal. We worked extensively, have spent hours  ourselves, our staff, consulting and trying to make this a better and  stronger bill. While I regret that we couldn't get it to the point  where those two esteemed Members felt they could support the bill,  nonetheless, their input made this bill better, and I am grateful for  their hard work and advocacy on behalf of a stronger privacy and civil  liberties protection.   This vote today is the culmination of many months of negotiations.  Therefore, with our diverse Caucus, with our friends in the other party  who, as you have heard today, we have strong disagreements over the  Russia investigation, the Trump campaign's conduct, as well as the FISA  process, but, nonetheless, in the interest of our Nation's security, we  were able to get to common ground on this measure, giving the  government the critical tools it needs to protect the country while  advancing civil liberties and privacy rights.   This bill creates a much-needed change to the way government uses  FISA, ensures the government is more transparent and accountable, and I  urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
