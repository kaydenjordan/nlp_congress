 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of a  one-of-a-kind event being held in the heart of our Nation's Capital.  Earlier today, I visited A Celebration of Construction on The National  Mall.   This event, hosted by the Association of Equipment Manufacturers and  more than 40 manufacturers and trade groups, brings together larger- than-life machinery to the steps of the U.S. Capitol and is enjoyed by  both adults and many children alike.   For 3 days, visitors to The National Mall will have the opportunity  to see this equipment up close. This is a unique opportunity for  policymakers to learn about the manufacturers across the country,  including some Iowa manufacturers like Vermeer, Cemen Tech, and John  Deere, who are creating American jobs and contributing billions  annually to our economy.   Iowa's Third District is home to more than 34,000 equipment  manufacturers, more than any other district in the country. I applaud  AEM for showcasing this work on The National Mall, and I encourage my  colleagues to take time to visit this exhibition.                            ____________________
