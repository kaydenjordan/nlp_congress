 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 998.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 998, the Searching for and Cutting Regulations  that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act, also known as the SCRUB Act, was  introduced by our colleague Jason Smith. I happen to be a cosponsor of  this bill, as well as the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), the  chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, and the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Sessions), the chairman of the Committee on Rules. We rise  in support of this bill, the SCRUB Act.   Regulatory accumulation is a significant problem for the Federal  Government. Year after year, Federal agencies add regulation after  regulation, piling on to an already very complex and crowded regulatory  system. The Code of Federal Regulations, also known as the CFR, has  some 178,000 pages. These are the regulations that you are supposed to  understand if you are in a business--small business, big business,  medium-sized business. It contains more than 1 million regulatory  restrictions. Every year the Federal Government adds, on average,  nearly 12,000 new regulations on top of those.   The regulatory accumulation has considerable impact upon our economy.  According to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, regulatory  compliance hurts economic growth by pulling nearly $1.8 trillion out of  the economy. Regulations are particularly hard on small businesses that  don't have the legal resources and the wherewithal to understand all of  the complexities. Many small- and medium-sized businesses will be doing  things that they don't necessarily even know or understand could be  problematic.   There is room for regulation, don't get me wrong. I am not suggesting  there should be no regulation, but we are trying to clean up some of  this regulation and weed out the good from the bad. The SCRUB Act will  enable the government to do so, and that is why I appreciate our  colleague Jason Smith for championing and bringing this bill to the  floor again.   The SCRUB Act establishes a bipartisan--and I can't say that enough,  a bipartisan--Retrospective Regulatory Review Commission to conduct a  comprehensive review of Federal regulation. The commission's goal is to  reduce regulatory costs to the economy by at least 15 percent.   The act charges the commission with identifying outdated, obsolete,  and unnecessary regulations in need of repeal or amendment. The  commission gives priority to those regulations that are 15 years old  and older. I think that is an appropriate direction that they should  go.   The commission will consist of regulatory experts chosen on a  bipartisan basis and confirmed by the United States Senate. They will  take a governmentwide look at the regulatory system, allowing for  impartial and wide-ranging review of outdated and unnecessary  regulations.   This is not a new or a partisan concept. In fact, in 1978, President  Jimmy Carter issued an executive order requiring agencies to  ``periodically review their existing regulations to determine whether  they are achieving the policy goals.'' In addition, every President  since has required some level of retrospective regulatory self-review  by those agencies themselves. In fact, it was President Obama who  issued three executive orders on regulatory review. He required  agencies to develop retrospective review plans and to set priorities  for implementing that review.   The commission is tasked with identifying regulations that ought to  be repealed or amended. The commission will use commonsense criteria to  determine whether regulations are overlaps, duplicates, or just flat- out conflicts with existing regulations. After expedited congressional  approval, agencies are required to repeal some regulations based on the  commission's recommendations. So you have people who are selected, they  are Senate confirmed, then they bring forward a package that is allowed  to be viewed by Congress.   Some have said, well, you know, this is excusing Congress from its  duties. Quite to the contrary. The committees, Members, everybody  should be paying attention to this, but to have a bipartisan group go  out and look and make a recommendation, then it is up to Congress  whether or not to accept it. We need to go through the House, the  Senate, and be signed on by the President in a bipartisan way because  there  [[Page H1371]]  will be Members from both sides of the aisle who will be able to  appoint members.   Other regulations would be subject to innovative, regulatory CutGo  procedures. The CutGo process gives agencies flexibility on how to  prioritize regulatory elimination. It allows agencies to choose which  regulations to repeal or amend and at what time. However, new  regulations may not be promulgated until equally costly regulations are  repealed.    The SCRUB Act gives agencies the direction and momentum needed to  implement the regulatory reform our economy needs. We all know that  regulations can improve health and safety; but sometimes, with the best  intention, these outdated and excessive regulations hurt our economy  and put other people in jeopardy. The accumulation over decades is  something that should just simply be reviewed. I think it is pretty  hard to argue that a review process is unwarranted or unneeded, given  the amazing and impactful status that it puts upon those things that  are damaging our economy.   I again want to thank Jason Smith for his leadership on this issue. I  also want to thank Chairman Bob Goodlatte and the Judiciary staff for  their dedicated work on this, as well as Chairman Pete Sessions for his  good work on this. A lot of good people have worked on this. I do  support it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and             Government Reform,                                 Washington, DC, February 16, 2017.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: On February 14, 2017, the Committee on       Oversight and Government Reform ordered reported without       amendment H.R. 998, the ``Searching for and Cutting       Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act of 2017''       (SCRUB Act) by a vote of 22 to 17. The bill was referred       primarily to the Committee on Oversight and Government       Reform, with an additional referral to the Committee on the       Judiciary.        I ask that you allow the Committee on the Judiciary to be       discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it       may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no       way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the       bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future       referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be       necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee       on the Judiciary represented on the conference committee.       Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any       response in the bill report filed by the Committee on       Oversight and Government Reform, as well as in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration, to       memorialize our understanding.        Thank you for your consideration of my request.            Sincerely,                                                    Jason Chaffetz,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                  Washington, DC, February 21, 2017.      Hon. Jason Chaffetz,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Chaffetz: I write with respect to H.R. 998,       the ``Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are       Unnecessarily Burdensome Act.'' As a result of your having       consulted with us on provisions within H.R. 998 that fall       within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the       Judiciary, I forego any further consideration of this bill so       that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for       consideration.        The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 998 at       this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our       committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our       committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation and asks       that you support any such request.        I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 998 and would ask       that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of H.R. 998.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Ross).
