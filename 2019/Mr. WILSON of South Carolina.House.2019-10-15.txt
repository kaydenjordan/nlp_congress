 Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, I  participated as the ranking member with Co-Chairman Congressman Alcee  Hastings and Co-Chairman Senator Roger Wicker of the Joint Commission  on Security and Cooperation in Europe--the Helsinki Commission--to  attend the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly in Marrakech, Morocco, with  fellow Congressmen Emanuel Cleaver and   Andy Harris.   We were warmly received into North Africa by President Mohamed  Ennaceur of Tunisia in Tunis. We saw firsthand the vibrant democracy  conducting parliamentary and presidential elections. We placed a wreath  at the North Africa American Cemetery and Memorial, where over 6,500  Americans are memorialized for liberating North Africa from Nazi  occupation.   In Jerusalem, we met with our dedicated U.S. Ambassador to Israel,  David Friedman, who presented an update on the U.S.-Israeli Alliance.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu enthusiastically reviewed the ever- changing political situation. We were inspired with an audience with  the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Theophilos III.   Chief of Staff Alex Johnson provided well-researched briefing  materials for the assembly in Marrakech.   With parliamentarians from 57 nations, it was refreshing that  opportunities were available for full participation, led by Assembly  President  [[Page H8116]]  Tsereteli of Georgia with Secretary General Roberto Montella of Italy.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th and the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
