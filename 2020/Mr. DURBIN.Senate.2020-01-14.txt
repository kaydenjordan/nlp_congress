 Madam President, the Senate as it is currently meeting is  in the normal course of business, but in just a few days, this Senate  Chamber will change. It will no longer be the Senate considering  resolutions and legislation; it will be a Senate considering an  impeachment proceeding. It will be a piece of history for those who  watch. This will be only the third time in the history of the United  States of America that the Senate will be convening for an impeachment  proceeding relative to the President of the United States. It is a  matter of the most serious constitutional gravity, and I hope all of us  as Members of the Senate will consider it and approach it that way.   Under the Constitution, we have a unique role as Members of the  Senate. We are the jurors; we are the jury. There are 100 Senators who  will decide whether the Articles of Impeachment should be voted on and  whether the impeachment of the President of the United States should  proceed.   We are also in a unique role under the Constitution in that we aren't  just jurors sitting silently in the jury box. We are also judges in one  respect. We set up the procedure, the way the trial moves forward.   Before I was elected to Congress, I used to practice trial law, and  jurors had the ultimate word in terms of the fate of my clients, but  the jurors didn't decide the procedure of the trial. That was decided  by a judge. When it comes to an impeachment proceeding under the  Constitution, the actual process or the procedure of the impeachment  trial is decided by the jurors, the Senators. It is very unusual, but  it was a decision made by our Founding Fathers to put this ultimate  test of impeachment in the hands of the Senators.   Why pick the Senate? It could have gone to the Supreme Court or some  other tribunal. Alexander Hamilton said that there were two reasons  they wanted to bring the impeachment trial to the floor of the Senate.  He said that the Senators, by their nature and political composition,  would be ``independent and dignified''--his words, ``independent and  dignified.'' I hope he is right.   I was here 20 years ago during the Clinton impeachment trial, and I  can remember very well how the temperament and mood and environment on  the floor of the Senate changed when the impeachment proceedings began.  There was the arrival of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in his  judicial role to sit where the current Presiding Officer of the Senate  is sitting and to preside over the trial. Instantly, when you walked  into the Chamber and saw the Chief Justice, you knew this was  different. This was a new challenge. This was being treated differently  by the Constitution.   Then, of course, each of us, having been sworn in to be Senators  representing the States that sent us, take a separate oath when it  comes to our responsibilities under impeachment. That oath is fairly  routine, but it includes one phrase that stands out when I read it. We  swear that we will impart ``impartial justice'' as impeachment jurors-- impartial justice. We hold up our hands and swear. We sign the book on  the desk at the front of the Senate, as a matter of history, that we  have made this oath for impartial justice. That is why I have been  troubled, as we lead up to this impeachment proceeding, when I hear  some of the statements and speeches that have been made on the floor of  the Senate.   The Republican leader from Kentucky said very openly several weeks  ago that he was going to work with the President's defense team to  prepare for how he would handle the impeachment proceedings in the  Senate. I understand there are some elements of this that just make  sense that there would be conversation with the managers of the  impeachment as to the procedure to be followed. But what we have heard,  even today, on the floor of the Senate is more than just cooperation in  setting up the workings of the impeachment proceeding. What we have  heard from the Republican majority leader is nothing short of an  opening statement at a trial. He has come to the floor even today to  question, challenge, diminish, even ridicule the entire impeachment  proceeding. To me, that steps over a line--a line where we were sworn  to show impartial justice in this proceeding. When the Senator from  Kentucky comes to the floor and says, for example, that this is a  hurried process, he raises the question as to whether the impeachment  proceedings in the House were appropriate. He is correct when he says  that the previous impeachments have had lengthy investigations leading  up to them. In fact, one I recall before I was elected to Congress  involving President Nixon went on for months on questions of the  Watergate scandal, which was at the heart of the proposed Nixon  impeachment. There were special prosecutors and investigators and  people who worked  [[Page S172]]  constantly for month after month after month before the Articles of  Impeachment were being prepared. You may recall that President Nixon  resigned before the actual impeachment proceeding.   But, then again, there was the Ken Starr investigation under  President Clinton. It, too, went on for months with sworn testimony and  depositions and videotaped proceedings of witnesses that led up to the  impeachment.   This is different. The case is being brought to us by the House of  Representatives for the impeachment of President Trump. It is true that  in comparison it had a shorter investigative process, shorter than the  two I just referenced. But it is also true that the second count of the  Articles of Impeachment raises the question as to whether the President  cooperated in providing witnesses and evidence that led to the Articles  of Impeachment in the House, and that is one of the counts of  impeachment against him--that he didn't participate and cooperate.   For the Senator from Kentucky to stand here and say that it should  have been a lengthier proceeding in the House--there should have been  more witnesses; there should have been more evidence--is to ignore the  obvious. One of the counts of impeachment raises the question as to  whether the President appropriately denied any cooperation with the  House impeachment proceeding.   Secondly, the Senator from Kentucky comes to the floor and  consistently says that the suggestion that we should allow witnesses  and evidence to be considered is evidence of the weakness of the case  coming out of the House of Representatives. Well, there aren't an exact  number of parallels between ordinary civil and criminal litigation and  impeachment proceedings, but in the world of law and trials, there is  usually an opening pleading or proceeding through a grand jury that  leads to charges against an individual. I have been through that many  times on the civil side--rarely, but once in a while, on the criminal  side. The trial itself takes that initial pleading, that initial  statement of a case, and elaborates on it, opens up, brings in evidence  and witnesses on both sides.   When we talk about witnesses and evidence coming before the Senate on  any impeachment proceeding with President Trump, it isn't just on one  side of the case. What we are suggesting is there should be witnesses  from both sides. Let the President bring those who he believes can  speak most convincingly to his innocence. Let the House managers  supporting impeachment take the opposite position and find those  witnesses who they think tell the story from their side of the case.  That is the nature of a trial. The American people have seen it over  and over again in their personal lives and in what they have witnessed  on television and other places. Both sides put on their best evidence,  and, ultimately, the jury decides the truth of the matter. That is all  the Democrats are asking for here.   We are asking that the impeachment proceeding witnesses be allowed on  both sides, evidence be allowed on both sides, and, ultimately, as  Senator Schumer said earlier, we get to the truth of the matter; we  make our decision in the Senate; and the American people get to witness  this democratic process.   Senator McConnell has said in many different places that he resists  this idea of witnesses and evidence, but I hope he will reconsider. I  hope at least four Republican Senators will reconsider--if they are in  Senator McConnell's position--and opt, instead, for the historic  precedent of witnesses and evidence at a trial.   The Senate will change this week. If you are witnessing it through C- SPAN or in the audience in the Galleries, you will notice it. First,  the Senators will be on the floor of the Senate, which is rare, and  second, with the Chief Justice presiding, there is a much different air  in the proceedings and business of the Senate.   The final point I want to make is that I am troubled by the continued  suggestion that the prospect of an impeachment trial is holding the  Senate hostage, that we cannot consider serious legislation because of  the possibility of an impeachment trial. It is true that once the trial  starts, we devote ourselves to it. But that hasn't happened.   So how do the leaders of the Senate on the Republican side explain  the year 2019? It was a unique year in the history of the Senate. It  was unique for what we failed to do. During the course of the entire  year, the Senate considered 22 amendments total. There were 22  amendments on the floor of the Senate. Six were offered by the junior  Senator from Kentucky, all of which, I believe, failed. But there were  22 amendments in a year. I can tell you that it is not unusual if you  look at the history of the Senate for us to consider 22 amendments in  the course of a week, sometimes in the course of a day. But in the  entire year, there were only 22 amendments. Why? Because Senator  McConnell, who has the power under the Senate rules, decided there  would be no business before the Senate but for the filling of judicial  vacancies and other Executive appointments. That was it. A handful of  other pieces of legislation were considered--the Defense authorization  bill and, finally, a massive spending bill--but never with amendments.  So to suggest that the impeachment trial has something to do with the  inactivity in the Senate is to ignore the obvious.   Last year, before there were any Articles of Impeachment, Senator  McConnell, under his leadership, called for virtually nothing to be  debated and considered on the floor of the Senate. I have said this  before, and I stand by it. This is a Senate Chamber, but too many days,  in too many respects, it is a storage facility. We are storing the  desks of the Senate, once occupied by Senators who came here to work.  They offered bills, offered amendments, had real debates and votes. We  look at these desks and say: Boy, it must have been a great day in the  Senate when you actually did that.   For the Republicans to blame the impeachment process for the  inactivity of last year defies common sense. For that reason, I hope  that when the impeachment trial ends, Senator McConnell of Kentucky,  the Republican majority leader, will consider at least 1 of the more  than 200 bills that the Democratic House of Representatives has sent us  to consider--bills relating to healthcare, bills relating to the price  of prescription drugs, bills relating to student loans, bills relating  to immigration. They are all sitting somewhere in a file cabinet and a  computer somewhere in Senator McConnell's office. Maybe we can be the  Senate after the impeachment trial. It is in the hands of Senator  McConnell to make that decision.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Klobuchar), the Senator from  Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Murphy),  the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from  Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.  [[Page S195]]    There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3190         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Domestic Terrorism       Prevention Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Recent reports have demonstrated that White       supremacists and other far-right-wing extremists are the most       significant domestic terrorism threat facing the United       States, including--        (A) a February 22, 2019, New York Times op-ed, by a Trump       Administration United States Department of Justice official,       who wrote that ``white supremacy and far-right extremism are       among the greatest domestic-security threats facing the       United States. Regrettably, over the past 25 years, law       enforcement, at both the Federal and State levels, has been       slow to respond. . . .Killings committed by individuals and       groups associated with far-right extremist groups have risen       significantly.'';        (B) an April 2017 Government Accountability Office report       on the significant, lethal threat posed by domestic violent       extremists, which--        (i) explained that ``[s]ince September 12, 2001, the number       of fatalities caused by domestic violent extremists has       ranged from 1 to 49 in a given year.''; and        (ii) noted that ``[F]atalities resulting from attacks by       far right wing violent extremists have exceeded those caused       by radical Islamist violent extremists in 10 of the 15 years,       and were the same in 3 of the years since September 12, 2001.       Of the 85 violent extremist incidents that resulted in death       since September 12, 2001, far right wing violent extremist       groups were responsible for 62 (73 percent) while radical       Islamist violent extremists were responsible for 23 (27       percent).''; and        (C) an unclassified May 2017 joint intelligence bulletin       from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department       of Homeland Security, which found that ``white supremacist       extremism poses [a] persistent threat of lethal violence,''       and that White supremacists ``were responsible for 49       homicides in 26 attacks from 2000 to 2016 . . . more than any       other domestic extremist movement''.        (2) Recent domestic terrorist attacks include--        (A) the August 5, 2012, mass shooting at a Sikh gurdwara in       Oak Creek, Wisconsin, in which a White supremacist shot and       killed 6 members of the gurdwara;        (B) the April 13, 2014, mass shooting at a Jewish community       center and a Jewish assisted living facility in Overland       Park, Kansas, in which a neo-Nazi shot and killed 3       civilians, including a 14-year-old teenager;        (C) the June 8, 2014, ambush in Las Vegas, Nevada, in which       2 supporters of the far-right-wing ``patriot'' movement shot       and killed 2 police officers and a civilian;        (D) the June 17, 2015, mass shooting at the Emanuel AME       Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in which a White       supremacist shot and killed 9 members of the church;        (E) the November 27, 2015, mass shooting at a Planned       Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in which an       anti-abortion extremist shot and killed a police officer and       2 civilians;        (F) the March 20, 2017, murder of an African-American man       in New York City, allegedly committed by a White supremacist       who reportedly traveled to New York ``for the purpose of       killing black men'';        (G) the May 26, 2017, attack in Portland, Oregon, in which       a White supremacist allegedly murdered 2 men and injured a       third after the men defended 2 young women whom the       individual had targeted with anti-Muslim hate speech;        (H) the August 12, 2017, attacks in Charlottesville,       Virginia, in which--        (i) a White supremacist killed one and injured nineteen       after driving his car through a crowd of individuals       protesting a neo-Nazi rally, and of which former Attorney       General Jeff Sessions said, ``It does meet the definition of       domestic terrorism in our statute.''; and        (ii) a group of 6 men linked to militia or White       supremacist groups assaulted an African-American man who had       been protesting the neo-Nazi rally in a downtown parking       garage;        (I) the July 2018 murder of an African-American woman from       Kansas City, Missouri, allegedly committed by a White       supremacist who reportedly bragged about being a member of       the Ku Klux Klan;        (J) the October 24, 2018, shooting in Jeffersontown,       Kentucky, in which a White man allegedly murdered 2 African       Americans at a grocery store after first attempting to enter       a church with a predominantly African-American congregation       during a service;        (K) the October 27, 2018, mass shooting at the Tree of Life       Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in which a White       nationalist allegedly shot and killed 11 members of the       congregation;        (L) the April 27, 2019, shooting at the Chabad of Poway       synagogue in California, in which a man yelling anti-Semitic       slurs allegedly killed a member of the congregation and       wounded 3 others;        (M) the August 3, 2019, mass shooting at a Walmart in El       Paso, Texas, in which a White supremacist with anti-immigrant       views killed 22 people and injured 26 others;        (N) the December 10, 2019, shooting at a Kosher supermarket       in Jersey City, New Jersey, in which 2 men with anti-Semitic       views killed 3 people in the store and a law enforcement       officer in an earlier encounter; and        (O) the December 28, 2019, machete attack at a Hanukkah       celebration in Monsey, New York, in which a man who had       expressed anti-Semitic views stabbed 5 individuals.        (3) In November 2019, the Federal Bureau of Investigation       released its annual hate crime incident report, which found       that in 2018, violent hate crimes reached a 16-year high.       Though the overall number of hate crimes decreased slightly       after three consecutive years of increases, the report found       a 4-percent increase in aggravated assaults, a 15-percent       increase in simple assaults, and a 13-percent increase in       intimidation. There was also a nearly 6-percent increase in       hate crimes directed at LGBTQ individuals and a 14-percent       increase in hate crimes directed at Hispanic and Latino       individuals. Nearly 60 percent of the religion-based hate       crimes reported targeted American Jews and Jewish       institutions. The previous year's report found that in 2017,       hate crimes increased by approximately 17 percent, including       a 23-percent increase in religion-based hate crimes, an 18-      percent increase in race-based crimes, and a 5-percent       increase in crimes directed against LGBTQ individuals. The       report analyzing 2016 data found that hate crimes increased       by almost 5 percent that year, including a 19-percent rise in       hate crimes against American Muslims. Similarly, the report       analyzing 2015 data found that hate crimes increased by 6       percent that year. Much of the 2015 increase came from a 66-      percent rise in attacks on American Muslims and a 9-percent       rise in attacks on American Jews. In all 4 reports, race-      based crimes were most numerous, and those crimes most often       targeted African Americans.        (4) On March 15, 2019, a White nationalist was arrested and       charged with murder after allegedly killing 50 Muslim       worshippers and injuring more than 40 in a massacre at the Al       Noor Mosque and Linwood Mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand.       The alleged shooter posted a hate-filled, xenophobic       manifesto that detailed his White nationalist ideology before       the massacre. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern labeled the       massacre a terrorist attack.        (5) In January 2017, a right-wing extremist who had       expressed anti-Muslim views was charged with murder for       allegedly killing 6 people and injuring 19 in a shooting       rampage at a mosque in Quebec City, Canada. It was the first-      ever mass shooting at a mosque in North America, and Prime       Minister Trudeau labeled it a terrorist attack.        (6) On February 15, 2019, Federal authorities arrested U.S.       Coast Guard Lieutenant Christopher Paul Hasson, who was       allegedly planning to kill a number of prominent journalists,       professors, judges, and ``leftists in general''. In court       filings, prosecutors described Lieutenant Hasson as a       ``domestic terrorist'' who in an email ``identified himself       as a White Nationalist for over 30 years and advocated for       `focused violence' in order to establish a white homeland.''.
