 Mr. President, for more than 100 years, throughout times of  change, tumult, and uncertainty, there has been a constant: the special  relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom.   The UK has been one of our staunchest and most loyal allies. We have  stood beside each other through two World Wars and the Cold War. In the  21st century, the United States and the United Kingdom have become even  stronger friends and partners, both in the fight against global  terrorism and for freedom, peace, and prosperity.   Now an opportunity lies before us to strengthen the relationship more  than ever by securing a free-trade agreement between our two nations,  which is the purpose of the resolution before us today. The trading  relationship between our countries is already really strong. For  hundreds of years, it has been a force for economic prosperity and  security for us both.   In just 2019, the total trade in goods and services between our two  countries totaled $273 billion, and the United Kingdom was the seventh  largest trading partner of the United States in goods. Figures from  that same year show that U.S. trade with the United Kingdom resulted in  a $21.8 billion trade surplus.   The United States and the United Kingdom, in fact, share the single  largest bilateral trade and investment relationship in the world. And  now, with the UK's newfound ability to negotiate independent free-trade  deals, we have the opportunity to grow that relationship even more.   A free-trade agreement would allow even more goods and services to  flow even more easily between our two countries. It would allow for  expanded commercial partnerships and greater investments in emerging  industries. It would serve as an even greater engine of prosperity and  economic liberty on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.  [[Page S4541]]    This is a no-brainer, and it would be a tremendous asset in the midst  of the economic and geopolitical challenges we face today. The pandemic  and supply chain turmoil have proven that friends are invaluable in a  pinch. While many global relationships have been unsteady and many  governments don't know what their future trading relationships will  look like, the United Kingdom has been a stalwart and secure partner  with the United States.   Furthermore, it could not be a better move in the age of great power  competition with China. We will not beat China by trying to be like  China in imposing centralized command-and-control grips on the economy  that will strangle trade and trample free enterprise. Instead, we  should do what we have always done best: prioritize free, open, and  fair commerce with friendly nations, as the G7 this past weekend  confirmed.   At the conclusion of the summit, the group, as a whole, agreed to  ``secure our future prosperity by championing freer, fairer trade  within a reformed trading system.'' And the United States and the  United Kingdom signed a New Atlantic Charter in which both countries  committed to take actions ``enabling open and fair trade between  nations.''   Securing a mutually beneficial trade agreement with one of our oldest  and closest allies would be in the best interest of us all. As  President Biden himself recently said: ``America's alliances are our  greatest asset, and leading with diplomacy means standing shoulder-to- shoulder with our allies and key partners once again.''   On this point, I could not agree with President Biden more. Congress  can seize this opportunity by supporting the resolution before us  today. It is a simple, straightforward resolution declaring the sense  of the Senate that the United States has and should have a close and  mutually beneficial trade relationship with the United Kingdom without  interruption and that the President, with the support of Congress,  should lay the groundwork for a future trade agreement between the  United States and the United Kingdom.    Borrowing a phrase from Prime Minister Boris Johnson, after his first  face-to-face meeting with President Biden at the summit this past  weekend, the United States-United Kingdom relationship is  ``indestructible.'' No two nations have worked more closely together.  No two peoples have done more to expand and defend liberty or to  achieve peace and prosperity.   Throughout history, this partnership has steadied the world through  some of its greatest perils. It can continue to do so today if only we  let it. The American and British peoples have the opportunity to once  again join forces and emerge from the challenges we face stronger than  ever for the benefit of our countries and nations across the globe. To  that end, I urge each of my colleagues to support this resolution.   And I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee be discharged  from further consideration, and the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 134.  I further ask that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed  to, and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table.    Mr. President, I appreciate the comments and the insight  provided by my friend and colleague, the distinguished Senator from  Oregon.   As to the point regarding our relative negotiating power and the  wisdom of approaching this task right now, it is important to remember  this resolution doesn't purport to offer the details of any such deal.  It calls for a free-trade agreement. There is nothing surrendered by  that. There is, however, a lot to be gained by that in signaling that  we want to continue to have an open, free, and fair relationship with  the United Kingdom.   As to the process concerns articulated by my friend and colleague,  while he has expressed some concerns about the process, I must provide  some evidence to the contrary.   Over the past year, my staff has communicated with the Senate Finance  Committee staff, staff on both sides of the aisle, upward of half a  dozen times. They have also pitched changes to assuage concerns about  language multiple times but never received any definitive responses.   Furthermore, I have worked with colleagues on the other side of the  aisle to craft almost identical draft language on United States-United  Kingdom trade that was included in S. Res. 117, on the Good Friday  Agreement, which passed before this body without objection. There is no  reason why we can't reach a similar compromise on this legislation, and  I stand ready and willing to work with my colleague from Oregon to do  so   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
