 Mr. Speaker, I rise to share the  incredible experiences from my recent ``Live the Dream Down East''  tour, a journey focused on creating economic opportunities for young  professionals in eastern North Carolina.   I was privileged to engage with local businessowners, medical  professionals, and community stakeholders throughout my tour. We  discussed the challenges they face.   In Rocky Mount, local businessowners tell me about their hopes and  inspiring aspirations for the future. By supporting our entrepreneurs  and making them aware of available resources, we can foster an  environment where businesses thrive and communities flourish.   Let's continue to showcase the true spirit of the American Dream down  East.                            ____________________
