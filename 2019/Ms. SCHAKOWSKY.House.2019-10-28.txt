Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on H.R. 2781.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2781, the EMPOWER  for Health Act of 2019, or Educating Medical Professionals and  Optimizing Workforce Efficiency and Readiness for Health Act, which I  introduced with my colleague, Congressman Burgess, in May. This  legislation advanced out of the Committee on Energy and Commerce by  unanimous vote.   By 2032, the United States may see a shortage of up to 122,000  physicians, but we already have a significant physician shortage. If  healthcare access were equitable across all races, socioeconomic  statuses, and geographic locations, the United States would need almost  100,000 more doctors immediately.   This legislation is one solution to this real problem. The EMPOWER  for Health Act will spur growth in our healthcare workforce and ensure  increased funding for several title VII health, education, and training  programs over the next 5 years.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, for decades title VII programs have assisted students  from minority and economically disadvantaged backgrounds to enter the  health professions by focusing on development, retention,  matriculation, and graduation, but we still have a lot of work to do.   In 1998 about 7 percent of the medical school matriculants were  Black, and 5 percent were Hispanic and Latino. In 2016 those numbers  only increased to 8.2 percent for African Americans and 6.2 percent for  Hispanics and Latinos. I believe the extreme racial health disparities  in this country are directly linked to the lack of underrepresented  minorities in medicine. This legislation reflects our commitment to a  diverse workforce by authorizing higher funding levels for these  diversity programs.   We also have a rapidly growing population of older Americans, as Mr.  Burgess mentioned. This legislation will address the extreme shortage  of health professionals expertly trained for care of the rapidly  growing and diverse population of older Americans.   As well, the pediatric workforce is at a crisis point right now. In  my home State of Illinois, for example, we face severe shortages of  child and adolescent psychiatrists. Children with special or complex  health issues often have to wait months before a specialist can see  them, and this is unacceptable. So this legislation will encourage  physicians to specialize in pediatric care by authorizing funding for  this critical program for the first time since 2010.   Finally, this bill also creates a new program to increase diversity  in the professions of physical therapists, occupational therapists,  audiologists, and speech-language pathologists. This was a section that  was added by my colleague from Illinois, Bobby Rush, and we appreciate  that.   This bill assures almost $2 billion in funding over the next 5 years  for these essential programs.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I will close with this: I thank all the Members who worked together  to produce this great legislation, especially my colleague, Congressman    Michael Burgess, who has been a champion of these issues and  introduced the bill along with me and the chairman of our Energy and  Commerce Committee, Mr. Pallone.   I also would like to give a quick thank you to the Energy and  Commerce Health Subcommittee staff on both sides of the aisle and my  health policy advisor, Osaremen Okolo.   Madam Speaker, I would also like to include in the Record a few  letters and statements from the Association of American Medical  Colleges, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Eldercare Workforce  Alliance, the American Geriatrics Society, the National Association for  Geriatric Education and the National Hispanic Medical Association all  urging strong support for this legislation.                   association of american medical colleges         ``The HRSA Title VII programs improve access to care for       rural and underserved communities and create a diverse and       culturally competent health workforce, which can enhance       patients' health outcomes,'' said the AAMC (Association of       American Medical Colleges). ``We applaud the House of       Representatives for passing bipartisan Title VII       reauthorization and recognizing the need to increase federal       funding in our nation's health workforce infrastructure.''  [[Page H8513]]                              american geriatrics society         ``The future we're working for at the AGS--a future when       all older Americans have access to high-quality, person-      centered care--begins by building the workforce to make that       possible, and by ensuring that workforce can connect us to       the tools and supports we need as we grow older together,''       observed Nancy E. Lundebjerg, MPA. CEO of the AGS. ``The       EMPOWER for Health Act will make that possible by supporting       two training programs that are as critical to our future as       they are widely supported, thanks in large part to the       bipartisan efforts that will make this bill law.''                         Eldercare workforce alliance         ``Our nation faces a severe and growing shortage of       eldercare professionals with the skills and training to meet       the unique healthcare needs of older adults,'' said Amy York,       Executive Director of the Eldercare Workforce Alliance. ``EWA       supports the EMPOWER for Health Act of 2019 because it       expands the only federal geriatrics training program. That's       an investment in an eldercare workforce that can support       well-coordinated, high-quality care for all older       Americans.''                 national association for geriatric education         ``NAGE is please to support the EMPOWER Act which will       enable the GWEP and GACA programs to continue to train health       care professionals and caregivers across the nation to care       for older adults with the most effective and efficient       practices. We are particularly indebted to Representative       Schakowsky who is a true leader in aging and health care       policy.''                        american academy of pediatrics         ``Across the country, there are significant shortages of       pediatric subspecialists, which lead to long commutes for       parents seeking care for their children and appointment wait       times that can last more than three months. For a child with       a complex, serious health condition, three months can seem       like a lifetime. Children with complex medical conditions are       among the most vulnerable; their ability to see the right       doctor in a reasonable amount of time should not be       determined by where they live. The EMPOWER for Health Act       reauthorizes the Pediatric Subspecialty Loan Repayment       Program, which is an important step toward addressing the       shortage and geographic disparities that impact a child's       ability to access subspecialty care. The American Academy of       Pediatrics thanks Rep. Schakowsky (D-Ill.) and Rep. Mike       Burgess (R-Texas) for their leadership advancing this       important legislation.''--American Academy of Pediatrics       President Kyle Yasuda, MD, FAAP                                   ____           National Association for Geriatric Education, National             Association of Geriatric Education Centers,                                                  October 28, 2019.      Hon. Jan Schakowsky,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Schakowsky: On behalf of the HRSA Title       VII and Title VIII funded Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement       Programs (GWEPs) across the country, thank you for your past       support of geriatric education and for introducing the       EMPOWER for Health Act of 2019, which is scheduled to come to       the floor of the House for consideration today. The National       Association for Geriatric Education (NAGE) is pleased to       offer our full support for the EMPOWER Act, which will       reauthorize the GWEP and once again make the Geriatrics       Academic Career Award program (GACA) a part of the effort to       prepare the geriatrics workforce for the aging of our       population. We and the growing numbers of older adults,       caregivers, and clinicians caring for elders are pleased that       you have been able to move this bill forward and will urge       the Senate to follow this lead and provide the resources to       address our nation's growing demand for geriatric care.        We appreciate the many discussions that your staff       facilitated with NAGE, as well as with the Eldercare       Workforce Alliance, the American Geriatrics Society, and The       Gerontological Society of America during the process of       developing this legislation. This authorization and related       funding are needed for the development of a health care       workforce specifically trained to care for older adults and       to support their family caregivers. The modest increase in       the authorization in your bill will have an important impact       on training in geriatric care. Likewise, the funds you have       authorized for the GACA program complement the GWEP, and       support faculty that will teach and lead geriatrics programs.       The bill will also assist in ensuring that rural and       underserved areas will have geriatrics education programs.        NAGE is a non-profit membership organization representing       GWEP sites, Centers on Aging, and Geriatric Education Centers       that provide education and training to health professionals       in the areas of geriatrics and gerontology. Our mission is to       help America's healthcare workforce be better prepared to       render age-appropriate care to today's older Americans and       those of tomorrow.        Thank you for your continued support for geriatric       education programs.            Sincerely,      Catherine Carrico, PhD,        President NAGE/NAGEC; Associate Director, Wyoming Geriatric       Workforce Enhancement Program, Wyoming Center on Aging;       Clinical Assistant Professor, College of Health Sciences,       University of Wyoming.                                   ____                                                   National Hispanic                                             Medical Association,                                      Washington, DC, July 21, 2019.      Hon. Jan Schakowsky,      Committee on Energy & Commerce, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Schakowsky: On behalf of the National       Hispanic Medical Association (NHMA) Board of Directors, we       strongly support H.R. 2781 ``Educating Medical Professionals       and Optimizing Workforce Efficiency and Readiness for Health       (EMPOWER for Health) Act of 2019''.        We support the amendment of Title VII of the Public Health       Service Act to reauthorize certain programs relating to the       health professions workforce from FY 2020 through FY 2024.       Critical health professional development programs revolving       around the underserved, Hispanic communities of this country       have been a staple of our organization. The programs listed       in this document are essential to furthering patient       population, physician parity.        The Centers of Excellence program award recipients, who       recruit, train, and retain underrepresented minority students       and faculty at health professional schools, achieve the       ultimate goal of producing a quality healthcare workforce       whose racial and ethnic diversity is representative of the       U.S. populations.        Health Professionals Training for Diversity has provided       scholarships for disadvantaged students, loan repayments, and       fellowships regarding faculty positions. These programs have       assisted students from minority and economically       disadvantaged backgrounds to enter the health professions for       decades by focusing on student development, retention,       matriculation, and graduation.        Past health professional school, graduate medical education       enjoys funds and accreditation authorized by this       legislation. The Primary Care Training and Enhancement       program accredits and funds residency and internship programs       in the fields of family medicine, general internal medicine,       and general pediatrics, and provides a need-based financial       assistance.        The National Hispanic Medical Association strongly supports       H.R. 2781 ``Educating Medical Professionals and Optimizing       Workforce Efficiency and Readiness for Health (EMPOWER for       Health) Act of 2019''. We are especially supportive since       this bill reauthorizes the aforementioned programs and       generally furthers a healthcare workforce that represents the       U.S. patient population.            Sincerely,                                        Elena Rios, MD, MSPH, FACP,                                                   President & CEO.     Madam Speaker, I certainly urge all my colleagues to  support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 728) to amend title VIII of the Public Health Service  Act to extend advanced education nursing grants to support clinical  nurse specialist programs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 728         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 728.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in great support of H.R. 728, the Nursing Workforce  Reauthorization Act introduced by Representatives Joyce, Gabbard,  Davis, Bonamici, Matsui, Castor, McKinley, and Underwood.   The title VIII nursing workforce program ensures that we have a  skilled, competent, and diverse nursing workforce, and the Nursing  Workforce Reauthorization Act will go a long way in strengthening these  programs.   This bill provides grants to nursing schools, academic health  centers, and other entities to help in training graduate-level nurse  practitioners and clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse-midwives  and certified registered nurse anesthetists and public health nurses.  The bill also reauthorizes the successful Nursing Workforce Diversity  grant program which has been shown to reduce health disparities and  improve outcomes for patients.   As our population ages we are seeing a growing demand for qualified  nursing. H.R. 728 helps us prepare for the future by training the next  generation of nurses and nurse educators.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1815     Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close with this.  Nurses are the backbone of our healthcare system. It looks like, in a  bipartisan way, everybody loves nurses. They provide frontline care in  a  [[Page H8516]]  variety of settings and often work to supervise and coordinate care for  patients. We couldn't live without them, and so we are helping them  today.   Madam Speaker, I urge the passage of this legislation with all of my  colleagues, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 2115) to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to  provide greater transparency of discounts provided by drug  manufacturers, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2115         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) commercially available drug pricing comparison       platforms can, at no cost, help patients find the lowest       price for their medications at their local pharmacy;        (2) such platforms should be integrated, to the maximum       extent possible, in the health care delivery ecosystem; and        (3) pharmacy benefit managers should work to disclose       generic and brand name drug prices to such platforms to       ensure that--        (A) patients can benefit from the lowest possible price       available to them; and        (B) overall drug prices can be reduced as more educated       purchasing decisions are made based on price transparency.

[[Page H8518]]         Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close now just by  saying the cost of prescription drugs is an issue on the minds of all  of our constituents, in a bipartisan way, all across the country, and  this bill will provide much-needed transparency around the activity of  pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs.   You heard very eloquent statements from our colleagues on this issue.  I am going to close now and just say I hope that all of our colleagues  will vote for this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.R. 647.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Engel), the author of this important legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 647, the  Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act.   This bill, introduced by Representatives Engel, Reed, Clarke, and  Carter, would establish palliative care and hospice education centers  to improve training of interdisciplinary professionals and faculty  members in palliative care.   The bill would promote career development of physicians who practice  hospice and palliative medicine. It also helps train the next  generation of practitioners by authorizing funds to train and retain  nurses, social workers, pharmacists, and others who are pursuing  advanced degrees in palliative care and related fields.   H.R. 647 will help patients facing serious conditions at the end of  their lives and improve hospice care availability and treatment.   I just want to say this bill is personal to me. My father, who lived  with me at the end of his life, we were the beneficiaries of hospice,  and it made all the difference in the final days of his life.   This bill has the support of 294 bipartisan cosponsors, as well as 89  different organizations. I would certainly urge all of my colleagues to  endorse, support, and vote for this important piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1930     Mr. Speaker, I think what you heard from Mr. Reed and  myself, and those people who have experienced the use of hospice care,  what a great and wonderful blessing it can be to our families.   Mr. Speaker, I support the legislation, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I think you could hear from the factual  and the heartfelt testimony you have heard about this bill that will  make hospice and palliative care more available that we all here urge  passage of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1781) to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security  Act to provide the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and the  Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission with access to certain  drug payment information, including certain rebate information, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1781         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1781.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1781, the Payment Commission  Data Act of 2019.   This bill will provide the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission,  otherwise known as MedPAC, and the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access  Commission, MACPAC, with access to drug pricing and rebate data under  Medicare parts B and D, as well as under Medicaid.   MedPAC and MACPAC are independent, nonpartisan commissions that  advise Congress on issues affecting the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Currently, MedPAC and MACPAC lack access to this drug pricing data and  are limited in their ability to provide information to Congress on the  skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs.   H.R. 1781 is a simple but critical fix to ensure that the commissions  have access to this data in order to analyze and report to Congress on  these urgent issues.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out that this evening, early  evening and now, we have passed a total of five pieces of legislation,  a couple of which were also out of the Ways and Means Committee. I  think it is a tremendous success and a bipartisan success.   So I want to thank Chairman Frank Pallone and the chair of the Health  Subcommittee, Anna Eshoo; Ranking Member Walden and ranking member of  the Health Subcommittee, Mr. Burgess, for their hard work.   But I also do want to just take a moment to thank the staff on both  sides of the aisle. On the Democratic staff we have: Stephen Holland,  Jacquelyn Bolen, Kimberlee Trzeciak, Una Lee, Tiffany Guarascio, and  Waverly Gordon.   These bills will strengthen our healthcare workforce and increase  transparency in prescription drug prices. They are all critical. I am  very proud that we were able to work in a bipartisan way to, hopefully,  right now, have them pass.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
