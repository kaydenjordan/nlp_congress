 Mr. President, I object to the certificate from the  State of Georgia on the grounds that the electoral votes were not--   The VICE PRESIDENT. There is no debate. There is no debate.   Section 15 and 17 of title 3 of the United States Code requires that  any objection be presented in writing, signed by both a Member of the  House of Representatives and a Senator.   Is the objection in writing and not only signed by the Member, but by  a United States Senator?    Mr. President, even as people waited hours in Georgia--   The VICE PRESIDENT. There is no debate. There is no debate.   If there is not one signed by a Senator, the objection cannot be  entertained.    Mr. President, the objection is signed by a Member of  the House, but not yet by a Member of the Senate.   The VICE PRESIDENT. It is over.   Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. President, the certificate of the  electoral vote of the State of Hawaii seems to be regular in form and  authentic, and it appears therefrom that Hillary Clinton of the State  of New York received 3 votes for President, and Bernie Sanders of the  State of Vermont received 1 vote for President, and Tim Kaine of the  Commonwealth of Virginia received 3 votes for Vice President, and  Elizabeth Warren of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts received 1 vote  for Vice President.   Senator BLUNT. Mr. President, the certificate of the electoral vote  of the State of Idaho seems to be regular in form and authentic, and it  appears therefrom that Donald J. Trump of the State of New York  received 4 votes for President and Michael R. Pence of the State of  Indiana received 4 votes for Vice President.
