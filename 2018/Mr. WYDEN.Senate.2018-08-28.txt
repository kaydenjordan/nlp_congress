 Mr. President, the Trump administration is engulfed in  scandal. The President has been implicated in at least one felony. His  former campaign chief, former deputy campaign chief, longtime personal  lawyer, and former national security adviser are all confessed or  convicted felons. With every passing week comes a shocking new  revelation about Russian interference in the 2016 election, another  bombshell report detailing their infiltration of conservative circles,  or another story about how woefully underprepared the United States is  to defend against another attack.   Here in Congress, Republicans have their heads buried in the sand. It  sure seems like they are going to keep on pretending it is business as  usual.   A year ago, I placed a hold on a Treasury nomination--Isabel  Patelunas to be Assistant Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis-- because of the Department's refusal to turn over documents related to  follow-the-money issues and other key investigative questions. Since  then, colleagues, Treasury's stonewalling has not changed. In fact, in  light of all that has been revealed in the last year, their  stonewalling is even more unpardonable.   The Treasury Department is participating in the coverup of criminal  activity. The least the Congress can do--the very least--is hold  nominees until the administration changes its behavior. It ought to  happen on a bipartisan basis. Republicans ought to stand up with  Democrats and say, ``This is dangerous. This is corrosive to our  democracy. This is wrong.''   Leader McConnell has gone ahead, filed cloture, and called votes on  the Patelunas nomination without doing any of that.   For me, this started a year ago, when I asked the Treasury to provide  the Finance Committee with key documents related to follow-the-money  and Russia. I am the ranking Democrat on the committee, which has  jurisdiction over the Treasury Department. We have a team of skilled  investigators who are highly adept at digging into the kinds of  questions that had been raised about Russian oligarchs like Alexander  Torshin and about shell companies and other forms of money laundering  and illicit finance. That is why I requested these documents from the  Treasury, but the Treasury essentially blew us off.   Russia's interference in our democracy has been thoroughly covered in  news reports, and many of those reports get right to the heart of why I  have called for investigators to follow the money. I will quote from an  article in Buzzfeed about Alexander Torshin, the accused Russian spy  Maria Butina, and her American associate Paul Erickson.   ``[Butina's] indictment said that she was communicating with Russian  intelligence while here and was `acting at the direction of a high- level official in the Russian government.'   ``That person, federal authorities told BuzzFeed News, is Alexander  Torshin--Butina's former boss, once a member of Russia's upper house of  parliament, and a close confidant of President Vladimir Putin.   ``In 2015, Torshin was appointed deputy governor of the Central Bank  of the Russian Federation and Butina was hired as his special  assistant. Torshin is believed to have close ties to gun rights  activists in the US, and McClatchy reported that the FBI is  investigating whether Torshin illegally funneled money to the NRA.  [[Page S5975]]    ``According to her indictment, Butina worked for Torshin until May  2016, and she came to the US on a student visa later that summer. The  same month, Spanish authorities reported that Torshin had been  laundering money for [a] Moscow-based . . . crime syndicate.   ``This year, Torshin was among the Russian oligarchs sanctioned by  the US Treasury Department for playing a key role in `advancing  Russia's malign activities.' Law enforcement sources told BuzzFeed News  that tens of millions of dollars in his suspicious financial  transactions were flagged by Treasury officials working on the FBI's  counterintelligence investigation into Russian influence.   ``These transactions included large, round-number wire transfers--a  hallmark of money laundering--from Istanbul and Dubai, the sources  said.''   Elsewhere in the report, Buzzfeed outlined how anti-fraud  investigators at a major bank flagged transactions by Erickson and  Butina as suspicious. Again, I will quote from the article.   ``The two also appeared to use a company, Bridges LLC, to conduct  suspicious transactions. Bank officials said they couldn't determine  the purpose of the company, which was incorporated in South Dakota in  February 2016. Butina was listed as the `sole signer' on its checking  account, but Erickson wrote and signed checks from it. He told  McClatchy that Bridges was formed to help Butina obtain financial  assistance for her graduate studies . . .   ``About $89,000 passed between Erickson's US accounts and one held by  Butina at Russia's Alfa Bank. In 2014, Erickson received $8,000 from  Butina's Alfa account. Between June 2016 and March 2017, Erickson sent  a dozen wires to her Alfa account totaling $27,000.   About $93,000 was sent or received during a single four-month  period--from May to August 2017 . . . Bank officials discovered wires,  checks, transfers, and cash deposits totaling that amount, including  checks made out to cash, between the duo's accounts last year.   ``In June and July 2017, Erickson wired $45,000 to an unidentified  law firm in Washington on Butina's behalf. It is not known why Butina  retained an attorney at that point, and her current lawyer, Robert  Driscoll, told BuzzFeed News that his firm was not the recipient of the  money.   ``. . . Investigators from Wells Fargo flagged dozens of other  suspicious transactions involving Butina and Erickson for FBI agents  and the Treasury Department's financial crimes division. Bank  investigators told Treasury officials they were suspicious about where  the money came from and that they could find no `apparent economic,  business, or lawful purpose' for the transactions.''   I am not going to comment on any classified material, and I am not  confirming these reports, but these articles are right out in the open.  The information reported by Buzzfeed alone ought to have been enough to  convince Senators that the administration needs to be forced to comply  with oversight requests from the Congress--just that one report--and  that is far from the only bombshell that has dropped in the last year  since I announced a hold on the Patelunas nomination. Still, Treasury  is stonewalling. They are blocking our oversight and our investigations  at every turn.   It is an outrage that Senate Republicans are apparently A-OK with  this stonewalling.   So colleagues, here is what I want to know: When does it become too  much? How many reports detailing election interference does the Senate  need to stand up and take action? How many stories about shell  companies and shadowy payments from oligarchs need to come out into the  open? Maria Butina is sitting in a jail cell in northern Virginia--how  many other spies need to be arrested before Senate Republicans stand up  to an administration that is hiding the facts?   A year ago, the President's son confirmed meeting with Russians in  Trump Tower during the campaign, at least one of them connected to  Russian intelligence. Senate Republicans did not try to get answers.   On the morning of Monday, July 16, Maria Butina was charged with  being a Russian spy. It was revealed she had infiltrated a ``gun rights  organization'' and woven herself into prominent conservative circles to  manipulate our politics. That same day, the Trump administration  announced a pro-dark money rule that would make it easier to get away  with this kind of lawbreaking the next time. Republicans did nothing  about it.   Last Tuesday afternoon, Paul Manafort was found guilty on five counts  of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud, and one count of failure to  disclose a foreign bank account. Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to  charges of tax evasion, bank fraud, and two felony campaign finance  violations he said he committed at the President's direction.   Again, Donald Trump has been implicated in a felony campaign finance  violation. Manafort and Cohen, who are convicted and confessed felons,  are both deeply enmeshed in the broader investigation into Russia's  interference in our election and potential collusion with the Trump  campaign.   The very same day, Senator Warner, as part of his questioning on the  U.S. Senate Banking Committee, had to repeatedly press Sigal Mandelker,  the Treasury Department's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial  Crimes, during a hearing on the effectiveness of Russian sanctions, to  be more responsive to bipartisan requests from the Intelligence  Committee. Treasury is 8 months behind in their responses to some  requests.   To her credit, Ms. Mandelker said she would respond in a timely  manner, though she noted she would have to consult with people back at  her office. The problem is that, pretty much every time anyone from  this administration has uttered such a promise, it has been broken  faster than it takes a wildfire to spread in the arid West.   Regardless of the promises made, the very next day, Leader McConnell  went ahead and filed cloture on a nomination I have been holding due to  the Treasury's stonewalling over those exact issues.   Colleagues, the President is routinely attacking the rule of law in  this country. He is attacking the Justice Department, which is run by  people he appointed. He has mused about pardoning people who are  unquestionably guilty of committing crimes. He said that perhaps it  should be illegal for individuals to cooperate with law enforcement by  providing information that can bring criminals and coconspirators to  justice.   When is enough enough?   In my view, nobody in this body, in their heart of hearts, could  possibly believe that the ties between the President, his associates,  the Trump organization, and Russia do not warrant thorough  investigation. You could not possibly have kept up with the news over  the last 18 months and come to any other conclusion. Everybody can  smell the smoke, but you would have to blind yourself not to see the  fire.   By stonewalling our investigations, the Treasury is complicit in the  coverup. They are hiding the facts from the Congress and the American  people. The Senate's powers of oversight and investigation are derived  from the Constitution of the United States, and the Trump  administration is trampling all over it. Every member of this body,  Democrat and Republican, ought to be outraged.   That is why it is wrong to proceed with the Patelunas nomination. I  drew the line here, with this nominee, but Leader McConnell filed  cloture against my known wishes, scheduling the vote to collide with  Members' plans to attend Senator McCain's memorial.   Furthermore, what the Treasury Department is doing to keep this  information about follow-the-money hidden in the shadows is wrong. The  Senate should not stand for it.    Mr. President, today the Senate confirmed the nomination  of Lynn Johnson to lead the Administration for Children and Families.  In less chaotic times, she would be running an office that few people  outside of Washington would hear much about. In the coming months,  however, she will be responsible for undoing a lot of the damage this  administration has done with respect to separating immigrant children  from their parents.   There are a few key matters I want to discuss today as this debate  closes.   As the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, I voted against  sending Ms. Johnson's nomination to the Senate floor. There were far  too many unanswered questions and misleading statements from the  administration regarding its family separation policy.   In the last week, I spoke with Ms. Johnson at length about what she  needs to accomplish if she is confirmed. She committed to me that she  would change how the Administration for Children and Families, and  particularly the Office of Refugee Resettlement, handle several key  policies. I want to guarantee that those commitments are laid out on  the record.   First, Ms. Johnson made several commitments to improve the treatment  of the kids in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement or in  facilities that receive grants from ORR. Those changes include  prohibiting solitary confinement as a punishment or an attempt to  change behavior; prohibiting arbitrary restraint policies; prohibiting  the distribution of psychotropic medications or sedatives outside of  emergency situations; unless the agency or facility has the informed,  written consent of a parent or guardian; prohibiting any security  measures that are not necessary for children's protection, such as  denying children access to drinking water or preventing them from  making private phone calls; and guaranteeing the confidentiality of  information disclosed by children to therapists and counselors during  treatment.   Ms. Johnson also committed to ensuring that separated children can  call their parents or legal guardians as frequently as they wish. Calls  can be monitored if there are documented safety concerns, but  otherwise, ORR and private facilities cannot prevent kids from talking  to their parents or guardians. If the parent or guardian is in the  custody of Homeland Security, the agencies must establish a way to  connect them by phone.   Finally, Ms. Johnson committed to conducting a full review, within 90  days, of the oversight, staffing, training, medication, and licensing  policies for ORR-funded facilities. She will issue a report to Congress  describing  [[Page S5988]]  the oversight of those facilities, as well as the actions the  Administration for Children and Families will take to correct any  problems.   That review will include a stem-to-stern examination of the policies  related to services offered to immigrants after their release. That  includes legal services and healthcare, including reproductive  healthcare.   If Ms. Johnson's agency cannot complete that review in 90 days, they  will provide a summary of their work to date and give the Congress a  new timeline and a guarantee of when the process will be finalized.   Let me be very clear: These are not suggestions from me or from the  Finance Committee. These are commitments set in stone. The Finance  Committee is going to watchdog this every day going forward. We will do  everything in our power to hold Ms. Johnson to these commitments.   This administration's continuing mistreatment of migrant children and  their parents is cruel and inhuman. Separating kids from their parents  has harmful, long-lasting effects to these kids' physical and mental  well-being. There is a lot of work left to be done reunifying the  families that were broken apart as a result of the administration's  ``zero tolerance'' policy. I believe Lynn Johnson will be an  improvement. I supported her nomination today, but you can bet my  colleagues and I are going to go to every length to hold her to the  commitments she has made.    Mr. President, today I am introducing the Clean Air  Refugee Assistance Act of 2018 to help Americans who have been driven  away from their homes by choking, hazardous wildfire smoke. Western  wildfires are getting bigger, hotter, and more difficult to fight and  scientists says it's only likely to get worse.   Folks back home in Oregon and across the Pacific Northwest already  know what I'm talking about because they're on the front lines of these  disasters. With dryer summers and lower snow packs, wildfires rage  across the West. They're threatening lives, homes, and businesses and  generating so much smoke that they're creating what I call clean air  refugees.   These are people who can't go outside and, in some cases, who must  flee their homes and communities to find pockets of fresh air.   I'm talking about children suffering from asthma and other conditions  and seniors who need a respirator to breathe.   In some cases, Oregonians lacking access to safe, clean air are being  told to seek shelter in public places like libraries and government  buildings.   My legislation would help provide some relief by opening the Federal  Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Transitional Sheltering Assistance  program to people seeking temporary shelter from wildfire smoke.   This program already permits FEMA to pay for temporary lodging for  people who can't immediately return home following a disaster.   My bill would permit clean air refugees to apply if they live in an  area where the air quality index is determined to be unhealthy for at  least three consecutive days as the result of a wildfire declared to be  a major disaster by the President or Governor of the affected state.   FEMA-approved applicants would pick from a list of participating  hotels and motels and FEMA would pay the lodging costs.   Mr. President, the Federal government needs to step up and be a  better partner on these wildfires and it can start by helping Americans  who have been driven from their homes find some refuge.   Passing the Clean Air Refugee Assistance Act would be a breath of  fresh air for folks struggling to escape the choking smoke, and I urge  my colleagues to support this important bill.                                  ______                                          By Mr. BOOKER:    S. 3404. A bill to impose a moratorium on large agribusiness, food  and beverage manufacturing, and grocery retail mergers, and to  establish a commission to review large agriculture, food and beverage  manufacturing, and grocery retail mergers, concentration, and market  power; to the Committee on the Judiciary.   Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Food and Agribusiness Merger  Moratorium and Antitrust Review Act of 2018, a critical bill that would  put a pause on the largest, most consequential acquisitions and mergers  in the food and agriculture sector, and give Congress an opportunity to  update our antitrust laws in order to protect America's farmers,  workers and rural communities who are being harmed by the ever  increasing levels of corporate concentration.   Almost 20 years ago, Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota introduced  the Agribusiness Merger Moratorium and Antitrust Review Act of 1999.   Senator Wellstone introduced that bill out of a concern that growing  concentration in the agricultural sector was harming our farmers and  rural communities, and was causing agricultural commodity markets to  become stacked against the farmer.   Senator Wellstone was right to be concerned, and over the past two  decades concentration has only gotten worse--much worse. Today a small  number of giant companies control every link of the food chain.   Consolidation has now reached a point where the top four firms in  almost every sector in the food and agriculture economy have acquired  abusive levels of market power.   Recently I traveled and met with farmers and ranchers in rural  America. I heard firsthand how excessive levels of concentration and  market power hurt our independent family farmers, who are being forced  to sell into ever more concentrated marketplaces that unfairly reduce  the prices they receive for their crops and livestock.   The data paints a grim picture: The farmer's share of every retail  dollar has plummeted from 41 percent in 1950 to approximately 15  percent today. Since 2013, net farm income for United States farmers  has fallen by half and median farm income was negative in 2017 and is  expected to be negative again in 2018.   Excessive market power has led to price gouging of both farmers and  consumers. For example, in 2016 the largest pork producer in the U.S.,  Chinese-owned Smithfield Foods, credited its enhanced profits to the  14-year low prices paid to farmers for live hogs and the higher selling  prices for pork to consumers.   In the past three decades, the top four largest pork packers have  seized control of 71 percent of the market, up from 36 percent. Over  the same period, the top four beef packers have expanded their market  share from 32 percent to 85 percent. The top four flour millers have  increased their market share from 40 percent to 64 percent. The market  share of the top four soybean crushers has jumped from 54 percent to 79  percent, and the top four wet corn processors control of the market has  increased from 63 percent to 86 percent.   The top four grain companies today control nearly 90 percent of the  global grain market.   During the past two years, there has been a wave of consolidation  among global seed and crop-chemical firms, and three companies now  control nearly two-thirds of the world's commodity crop seeds. Those  same three companies now also control nearly 70 percent of all  agricultural chemicals and pesticides.   In the United States, the four largest corn seed sellers accounted  for 85 percent of the market in 2015, up from 60 percent in 2000. Over  the past 20 years, the cost for an acre's worth of seeds for an average  corn farmer has nearly quadrupled, and the cost of fertilizer has more  than doubled. Yet corn yields increased only 36 percent over that time,  and the price received for the sale of a bushel of corn increased only  31 percent.   71 percent of the contract poultry growers who depend on the income  from their poultry contracts live at or below the federal poverty  level.   The United States is losing farmers at an alarming rate, agricultural  jobs and wages are drying up, and rural communities are disappearing.   These problems can be mitigated by more active use of our antitrust  laws, and allowing an opportunity for U.S. farmers and ranchers to  compete in fair and open markets.   The Food and Agribusiness Merger Moratorium and Antitrust Review Act  provides the opportunity to stop increased consolidation through  acquisitions and mergers until such time as a full review of the impact  of concentration is completed and government responses are formulated.   Specifically, this bill would halt large mergers in the food system  for 18 months and would set up a commission to study how to strengthen  antitrust oversight of the farm and food sectors and publish  recommended improvements to merger enforcement.   This moratorium would provide needed time to develop new tools to  strengthen merger enforcement and antitrust rules to address the unique  conditions in the farm and food economy and protect farmers, workers  and consumers.   The federal government needs to provide safeguards to the  agricultural marketplace so that farmers and workers have the  opportunity to share in the prosperity that open, transparent and fair  markets can provide them.   Senator Wellstone was prescient when he put forward this legislation  almost twenty years ago. The problem of concentration was apparent  then, and has grown even worse. What would  [[Page S5994]]  have been had the Senate passed this legislation then?   I did not have the opportunity to serve alongside Senator Wellstone,  but I know from my colleagues who did, that there was no better  advocate, no better organizer, who understood the power of coalitions,  who understood the power of taking an issue to the Senate floor and  demanding action. I look forward to working with my colleagues,  educating others about this issue, and continuing the work he started  to defend farmers, workers, and consumers from the harms being posed by  corporate concentration.
