 Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the retirement  of my friend, Dr. Jim Naramore. Dr. Naramore is retiring after 40 years  of service practicing family medicine in Gillette, WY. He has been an  outstanding doctor to many patients in Gillette, including myself, and  will be  [[Page S432]]  remembered for his excellence in medical care and helping out in the  community.   I know Dr. Naramore not only as a leader in my hometown of Gillette  but also as my personal doctor. About 25 years ago, I wasn't feeling  well and went to see Dr. Naramore. He ran some tests and soon  discovered that I had a torn heart valve. By that night, I was in open  heart surgery to repair my heart valve, and it has served me well  since. I credit Dr. Naramore with saving my life.   Dr. Naramore has spent his entire career helping people and giving  back to the community. Born and raised in Gillette, WY, Dr. Naramore  received his bachelor's degree from John Brown University, his medical  degree from the University of Utah, and completed a family practice  residency at the University of Nebraska affiliated hospitals. After his  residency, Dr. Naramore returned to Gillette to work in the emergency  room at the Campbell County Memorial Hospital.   In 1980, Dr. Naramore began his practice and became a full-time  member of the medical staff of Campbell County Memorial Hospital. In  1981, he moved to private practice at Family Health in Gillette. His  family health clinic has provided excellent care to residents of  Gillette for years and has attracted much needed providers and  specialists to the area.   Dr. Naramore has served in countless leadership positions both in  Gillette and around Wyoming. He has received many awards for his hard  work and outstanding achievements, most recently receiving the 2019  Outstanding Healthcare Award. Dr. Naramore is a committed man of faith.  He is actively involved in his church, serving as an elder, deacon,  worship leader, and Sunday school teacher.   The University of Wyoming has a slogan saying that the world needs  more cowboys. Well, I would also say that Wyoming needs more doctors,  especially doctors like Dr. Naramore. If his past is any indication of  his future, I think it is clear that he will be closing the door on  this great chapter of his life and moving on to something new. Whatever  that may prove to be, I am certain it will make good use of his  abilities, background, and experience. Diana joins in sending our best  wishes to Dr. Naramore and his family. We thank him for his hard work  and dedication to his patients and community throughout his career.                            ____________________
