 Madam Speaker, the Biden administration  wants to defend Ukraine's border but doesn't want to protect our own;  leaving our southern border exposed to an invasion coordinated by drug  cartels and human traffickers.   I visited the border with President Trump and saw firsthand how  Biden's border policies have contributed to a crime wave and a drug  overdose epidemic. I supported Articles of Impeachment for President  Biden because he is intentionally violating our immigration laws and  the security of our border, jeopardizing Americans' lives for political  purposes.   If President Biden is actually worried about the threat posed by  Russia, why isn't he concerned that in December 2,000 Russian nationals  illegally crossed America's southern border?  [[Page H348]]    My constituents miss President Trump and his policies that put  America first.
