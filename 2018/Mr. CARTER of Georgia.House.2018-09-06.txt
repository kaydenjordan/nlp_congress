 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  University of Georgia's College of Pharmacy's dean, Svein Oie, who  stepped down as dean on July 31 after 18 years.   Dean Oie's tenure led to great strides in the reach and capabilities  of UGA's College of Pharmacy. Also my alma mater, Dean Oie increased  the college's class size, added satellite campuses across the State,  began training residents, and created the Center for Drug Discovery to  develop new drugs to combat diseases that are, so far, incurable.   Although Dean Oie is stepping down as dean of the college, I am glad  that he is going to continue with his teaching profession. With a  shortage of healthcare professionals in the United States, his ability  to train these individuals is more important than ever.   Thank you, Dean Oie, for your service to the University of Georgia,  the field of pharmacy, and healthcare overall in the State of Georgia.                        Recognizing Pastor Bill Ligon     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  work of Pastor William T. Ligon, who is retiring from the ministry  after 60 years.   Pastor Ligon's dedication to the Word of God is unparalleled, taking  him not only throughout the First Congressional District of Georgia,  but across the globe. In the early part of his career, Pastor Ligon  served as a Southern Baptist missionary in Barcelona and Valencia,  Spain, where he was a professor in the Spanish Baptist Theological  Seminary.   When he returned to Georgia, he founded the Christian Renewal Church  in Brunswick. A testament to his abilities, Pastor Ligon's new church  grew rapidly and now includes seven congregations in three different  States. He has been the pastor of the Brunswick location for the past  44 years.   However, much of this would not be possible without Pastor Ligon's  wife, Mrs. Dorothy Jean Ligon, whom he has been married to for 60  years.   Thank you, Pastor Ligon, for the wonderful work you have been doing  in Georgia and across the world.                      Recognizing Edgar M. Edwards, Sr.     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Edgar M. Edwards, Sr., who passed away on August 1 at the age of 92.   Known as Mr. Ed to those around him, he will be remembered for his  unending passion to give all Georgia students the best possible  education.   Mr. Ed began teaching at the Bradwell Institute in Hinesville in  1950, beginning a career that took him through many different  perspectives in educating students. He quickly rose from teacher to  principal at Bradwell Institute and was rapidly elected superintendent  of the Liberty County School system, where he earned the Georgia  Superintendent of the Year Award.   Even when he retired from direct involvement with students, Mr. Ed  began work for an architecture company to build numerous schools  throughout the State of Georgia until he was 90 years old.   Perhaps most importantly, Mr. Ed had perfect attendance for 38  straight years at Bradwell football games.   I truly believe that Mr. Ed's passion and energy to impact the lives  of all students who step foot into the Liberty County School system is  a model we can all learn from.                           Recognizing Bob Warnock     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Bob  Warnock on both his 40-year anniversary practicing as a licensed  pharmacist and his retirement from the field.   Mr. Warnock is a talented pharmacist who made an impact not only on  countless patients, but also numerous aspiring pharmacists. He once  said to future pharmacists not to ``accept a diminished role. Make sure  every day when you go home you can say the life of at least one patient  is better because of your efforts.''   I have firsthand experience with Mr. Warnock's drive to improve the  lives of those around him, as he inspired me to do the same. He was one  of the first people to help me when I was trying to start my small  pharmacy business, and he remains a lifelong friend to this day.   Now Mr. Warnock oversees PruittHealth's entire pharmacy business,  employing thousands of workers and operating in multiple States, a  testament to hard work and a compassion for others. I am proud to know  Bob Warnock, and I know his expertise and kindheartedness will be  missed in the world of pharmacy.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I rise today in support of my  good friend, Mr. Johnson's bill, the Ensuring Small Scale LNG Certainty  and Access Act.   As many Members are aware, we are currently in the midst of a natural  gas boom, with liquefied natural gas more of a resource than ever  before. We have seen how this increase in production has benefited not  only the United States, but some of our closest allies and trading  partners. Now we have an opportunity to continue to build and foster  those relationships while stimulating American industries.   For over 60 years, the United States has been a net importer of  natural gas, relying on other countries to supply our LNG needs. I have  seen it firsthand, as I have a facility in my district that was once an  import facility for natural gas. That has changed as they are  undergoing a massive overhaul to allow for the export of natural gas.   This bill will help to address backlogs and delays in the application  process by allowing small shipments of LNG to be exported, so long as  they don't go over the threshold set forth in this legislation. That  would have major implications for our regional trading partners,  especially those in the Caribbean and Latin America, which don't have  access to consistent and reliable forms of energy production.   I applaud my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee for  their bipartisan work on this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to  support this bill.
