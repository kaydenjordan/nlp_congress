 Madam Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 5, the Equality  Act.   I have to stop for a second and take in this momentous occasion, for  I have the honor of being on the floor of the U.S. House of  Representatives, speaking in favor of a bill that I have worked on for  the past 5 years that will finally give full legal equality to the  LGBTQ community here in America. This is truly historic.   I want to thank Chairman Nadler, who has been an unwavering ally in  support of LGBTQ rights throughout his career, and thank Speaker  Pelosi, Leader Hoyer, and our whip,   James Clyburn, who have all  showed tremendous leadership in helping to get this bill to the floor.   I want to acknowledge and thank my LGBTQ Equality Caucus co-chairs,  who have shown extraordinary leadership, not just in blazing a trail  for future LGBTQ leaders, but in being friends and partners in this  fight to get where we are today.   I also want to thank our colleagues in the Senate for their  extraordinary leadership. And, most importantly, we wouldn't be here  today without the determined efforts of the advocates and allies in the  civil rights and LGBTQ rights community who banded together to fight  for the common values of dignity and equality under the law.   Throughout my life, I have seen, firsthand, the struggles that many  in my community have faced in achieving the American Dream. The right  to live freely, without fear of persecution or discrimination, is one  many in the LGBTQ community felt was an impossibility for so long.   The fact that we are here today about to vote on this legislation,  which has the bipartisan support of 241 Members of the House is, in and  of itself, an achievement. It was not easy to get here.   It was only 4 short years ago that the Supreme Court struck down the  Defense of Marriage Act, finally allowing members of the LGBTQ  community to marry in every State.   Don't Ask, Don't Tell was the law of the land until 6 years ago, and  today, the Trump administration is forcing the men and women in our  Armed Forces back into the closet and taking steps to target the LGBTQ  community in a variety of ways.   The forces working against progress are strong, but together, we are  stronger. We have made great strides in fighting for LGBTQ rights under  the law, but make no mistake, there are many people in this country,  including in this administration, who are actively working to undermine  our hard-fought gains.                                time  0930    That is why it is so significant that we have such strong and diverse  support for the Equality Act.   And I don't just mean 241 bipartisan cosponsors in the House. Look at  the 47 bipartisan sponsors in the Senate, the more than 200 businesses  in every State in the country who have endorsed the bill, and the  dozens of associations, advocacy groups, civil rights groups, and faith  groups that back it.   The Equality Act has the support of a majority of the American people  in every State. Let that sink in. In every single State in the country,  the American people think it is time to protect the LGBTQ community.   There is nothing more central to the idea of America, nothing that  has contributed more to the exceptionalism of our country and the  prosperity of America than the guarantee of equal protection of the law  for every single American.   They support this bill all across this country because it makes  sense, it is common sense. It adds sexual orientation and gender  identity as protected classes through existing civil rights law,  ensuring that the LGBTQ community enjoys the same protections as  everyone else, nothing more and nothing less.    Madam Speaker, I want to take a moment to talk about  what the Equality Act doesn't do. There has been a lot of  misinformation about this bill floating around, and I want to ensure  that my colleagues and the American people understand the facts.   The Equality Act doesn't force priests or other clergy to perform  same sex marriages or any other religious ceremony against their  beliefs.   It doesn't eliminate women's colleges, fraternities, or sororities,  or other nondiscriminatory sex-segregated program.   The Equality Act doesn't prevent parents from having control of their  children's medical decisions or force doctors to provide treatment  against their best judgment or religious beliefs.   And the Equality Act doesn't eliminate women's sports.   The Equality Act doesn't force churches to act as public  accommodations or eliminate the ability of religious institutions to  accept Federal money.   Here is what the Equality Act does. It ensures that every child of an  LGBTQ parent will not be turned away from the pediatrician's office.   It ensures that transgender teenagers can attend school without fear  for their safety.   And it ensures that LGBTQ employees can't get married on Saturday,  post pictures on social media on Sunday, and they get fired on Monday.   The Equality Act is quite literally a life-saving bill that addresses  some of the fundamental inequalities that still exist in the American  legal system.   The time is now. The moment is here. Future generations will look  back on this day as the moment where our elected leaders showed what  side of history they are on.   We are on the right side of history. Let's pass the Equality Act  today with overwhelming bipartisan support.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the additional  time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Yes, I would be happy to engage my colleague from  Utah.    Yes, that is correct. H.R. 5 adds protected classes to  title II of the Civil Rights Act but does not revise the exception for  private establishments not open to the public, meaning houses of  worship can continue their practices as before, including limiting  admission or attendance to members of their faith.    Yes. H.R. 5 does not, nor could any legislation,  supersede the First Amendment. H.R. 5 allows the standard set by prior  civil rights law to not interfere with worship and religious practices  by religious organizations.
