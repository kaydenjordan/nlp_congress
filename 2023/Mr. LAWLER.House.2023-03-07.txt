 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on this body to work in  a  [[Page H1134]]  bipartisan way to preserve Social Security and Medicare.   As I have said time and again when meeting with constituents, I am  fully committed not only to protecting Social Security and Medicare for  current and near retirees but also strengthening and preserving these  programs for future generations.   I was proud to sign on to H. Res. 109, which reaffirms this  commitment, and to cosponsor H.R. 82, the Social Security Fairness Act,  another important measure.   Those who have paid into Social Security should not have their  benefits reduced, especially given the affordability crisis impacting  so many families across my district and the country, including our  seniors, who are among the hardest hit by inflation and rising costs.   It is incumbent on all of us to never cease fighting for the millions  of Americans who have paid into and rely on these crucial programs. We  must preserve them for future generations.                            ____________________
