 Madam Chair, I thank my colleague from Nebraska and my  colleague, Mr. Bishop, for including this amendment in the en bloc.   I rise to support my amendment to support our dairy industry. I have  visited farms across southeast Wisconsin, and time and time again,  farmers have explained to me the challenges they have with consistently  low milk prices.   That is why we need this amendment, so we can continue to invest in  business development within the dairy industry and encourage new  markets for our farmers.   This amendment provides $1.5 million to support our Nation's dairy  industry in a budget neutral way.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support our dairy industry, to  support our farmers, and to support this amendment.
