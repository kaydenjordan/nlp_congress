 Madam Chair, I thank my friend for yielding me the time.   Madam Chair, let me begin my remarks, first of all, by welcoming to  our Capitol today Miss Jennifer Pinckney and her two daughters. They  are the wife and children of Reverend Clementa Pinckney, who, along  with eight of his Bible study parishioners, lost his life to a demented  white supremacist who said that he was interested in starting a race  war.   He entered their church, participated in the Bible study, into which  they welcomed him. And, as they closed their study that evening and  prayed for what they had experienced and for their next meeting, this  gentleman, while their eyes were closed, opened his and slaughtered  them.   I find it interesting that my colleague has talked about the  inconvenience of waiting longer than 3 days to purchase a weapon,  without mentioning those poor souls of Emanuel AME Church.    He has talked about people who might be inconvenienced; he has talked  about something he read in the newspapers; but he has not mentioned  them. Well, I am here today to say that the Members of this august body  need to think a little bit about the value of those lives.   Are they more valuable than the inconvenience a gun purchaser may  have by having to wait 10 rather than 3 days to make a purchase?   What would make one so anxious to purchase a gun in the first place?  If you have got to have a gun right now, chances are you have no useful  purpose, no redeeming value, in the purchase of that gun.   Maybe we ought to participate here, as Members of this body, in  helping this purchaser with a cooling-off period, which is all we are  asking to do here.   Charleston, South Carolina, is nicknamed the ``Holy City.'' Churches  and steeples dominate the skyline of this historic city, which, until  recently, had an ordinance that no building could be constructed higher  than 55 feet, wanting nothing to obstruct its steeples.   Faith is fundamental to the Charleston community. However, that faith  was rocked in June 2015 when this lone gunman rushed into this Bible  study, after having studied the most historic African American churches  in the State of South Carolina and developing a list of five churches,  one of which was Emanuel AME.   He, by his own admission, selected this church because of its  importance to the African American community, being the first organized  place of worship in the South for African Americans.                                time  0930    He selected this. This was a hate crime of the first order, and we  are saying we should not inconvenience him. And we did not  inconvenience him. We allowed him to get that gun after 3 days, when it  was around the fifth day that they found the glitch in the system and  found him to be ineligible to own a gun.   We just had a gunman go into his workplace in Aurora, Illinois. He  was ineligible to have a gun, but he was allowed to purchase the gun.  When they found out that he was ineligible to have a gun, they then  sent him a letter and said: Please bring us the gun back. You are not  eligible to have a gun.   Give me a break. No, he didn't return the gun, because he had no  redeeming value in having a gun. And he murdered his coworkers. And you  are telling me we should not inconvenience him.   Well, my colleague, the chair of the committee, has laid out for you  the procedure in this bill, a procedure that makes it a maximum,  irrespective of what my colleague may say, it is a maximum of 20  working days, business days, that one would have in order to purchase a  gun.   I would hope, as we move forward here today, we would think about  those poor souls of Emanuel AME Church, and we think about those 4,000  people, 4,200 people, who purchased guns in 2016 using this loophole,  and the 4,800 people who purchased guns in 2017 using this loophole.  Think about their families. Think about their children. And think about  what we are about to do here today.    Let me just take this minute to go back to what I had  prepared to say here today.   In troubling times, many of us find solace in the Serenity Prayer:  God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the  courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom--wisdom--to know the  difference.   The Charleston loophole is something all Members of Congress should  have the courage to change and, by doing so, grant the American people  the serenity they deserve in their schools, in their entertainment  venues, in their neighborhood streets, and, God forbid, in their places  of worship.   Madam Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 1112, the Enhanced  Background Checks Act of 2019.   Charleston, South Carolina, is nicknamed the Holy City. Church spires  dominate the skyline of this historic city, which, until recently, had  an ordinance that no building could be constructed higher than 55 feet.  In this city, faith is foundational. It is a source of strength and  community that dates back centuries.   However, that faith was rocked in June 2015 when a lone gunman  punctuated his participation in a Bible study at Emanuel AME  [[Page H2279]]  Church with gunshots fired upon the parishioners who had welcomed him,  killing nine and wounding three others. The shooter targeted this place  of worship because of its historic significance to the African-American  community. This egregious hate crime shattered the sanctity of the Holy  City, and in response Congress observed a moment of silence and all  Americans offered thoughts and prayers.   While a moment of silence and our thoughts and prayers are  appreciated in times of tragedy, they do nothing to solve the  underlying problem. The real tragedy in Charleston is it could have  been prevented. The gunman acquired the weapon used in the massacre  because of a fault in the law that is now known as the Charleston  Loophole. The gun purchase was subject to a background check; however,  when a glitch in the system caused the background review to take more  than the three-day limit allowed by law, the gunman was able to  purchase the weapon, although it was later found that he was ineligible  to purchase a gun. The system failed to stop this gun sale to an  ineligible purchaser and 4,864 others in 2017.   It has been 25 years since the Brady Bill became law, and there has  been no significant legislation enacted since to stem gun violence. Yet  in 2017, 100 people were killed each day in this country with a  firearm--which touches every district represented in this august body.   A vote in support of the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019  extends the time allowed for law enforcement to conduct background  checks. Under this bill, if the background check isn't concluded within  10 business days, the purchaser can request an expedited background  check, which notifies law enforcement of the urgency of the review and  starts an additional 10 business day period for the background check to  be completed. While more than 96 percent of background checks are  completed within three days--and 90 percent of Americans support  background checks--this expedited review allows for law enforcement to  complete the small percentage that may take longer than three days. If  at the end of the expedited review the background check is  inconclusive, then the purchase may proceed.   Restricting the Charleston Loophole doesn't prohibit law abiding  citizens from purchasing a gun, but it does provide more time, if  needed, for law enforcement to ensure weapons are not sold to those  with criminal convictions or mental illness. This is an important first  step our country should take to protect our citizens and their first  amendment rights.   In troubling times many of us find solace in the Serenity prayer-- God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change;  courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the  difference.'' The Charleston Loophole is something all Members of  Congress should have the courage to change and grant the American  people the serenity they deserve in their schools, entertainment  venues, neighborhood streets and--God forbid--their places of worship.    Madam Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman so much for  yielding the time.   Madam Speaker, let me just take this 1 minute to welcome to this  Capitol Ms. Jennifer, Ms. Malana, and Ms. Eliana Pinckney, the widow  and two surviving daughters of Reverend Clementa Pinckney.   They hid under his desk in the basement of Emanuel AME Church while a  demented gentleman who wanted to start a race war, was welcomed into  their Bible study--at the end of that hour, Reverend Clementa asked all  of the worshippers to bow their heads and close their eyes as he prayed  for what had occurred that evening. While their heads were bowed and  their eyes closed, Dylann Roof opened his, after having been welcomed  into their midst, and he slaughtered Reverend Pinckney and his eight  worshippers.   Why? Because he was allowed to get this gun when he was not eligible  to get one. They found out on the fifth day that he was ineligible but,  by that point, it was too late. As a result, those poor souls lost  their lives.   Let's give the FBI, let's give the authorities, enough time to do  their jobs. We will save lives and we will be better off for it.
