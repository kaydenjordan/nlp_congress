 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the George  Floyd Justice in Policing Act.   In the weeks since Mr. Floyd's murder, over 25 million Americans have  marched to defend our founding promise of equality for all.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all those who marched. Their demands for  equality have made today possible. I am proud to be a citizen of a  country where so many of my fellow citizens are forcing that arc of  history to bend a little faster towards justice.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank them all for reminding us of how  far we still have to go.   No justice, no peace; because a country founded on the rule of law  cannot guarantee peace if that law does not apply equally to all.   Black lives matter; because we still live in a country where the  health, wealth, and social disparities between the races make equality  anything but a self-evident truth.   Say their names; because the victims, they are not just Black bodies.  They were human beings with families and dreams, talents, and flaws.   In a truly colorblind world, the only thing that all these victims  would have in common, really in common, is that they shouldn't be dead.   We are not going to end systemic racism today, but we do have the  opportunity to correct just a few of our sins, the opportunity to end  chokeholds, the opportunity to end no-knock warrants, to make lynching  a Federal crime--can you believe we haven't done that yet?--the  opportunity to hold police departments to the same standards of  equality and fair play that all other employers do.   Mr. Speaker, I implore my colleagues on both sides of the aisle,  please, please, please vote ``yes'' on this bill, not because it means  our work is done, not because it means that we are going to end  systemic racism, not because what needs to be done is synonymous with a  bill that can pass this body in the Senate and get the President's  signature.   Vote ``yes'' on this bill so that you can tell your children that  George and Breonna and Tamir--Tamir Rice, who would have turned 18  today--and Trayvon, and Amadou, and Ahmaud, and Emmett, and so many  others, vote ``yes'' so that you can tell your children that they did  not die in vain.                            ____________________
