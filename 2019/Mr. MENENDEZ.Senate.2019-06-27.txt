 Mr. President, I rise to explain the context in which I  will vote for the Romney amendment.   First, I am grateful for Senator Romney's substantive contributions  and his collegiality as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee.   The plain text of the amendment states the obvious--that funds  authorized by the NDAA may be used to ensure the ability of our Armed  Forces to defend themselves and U.S. citizens.   I believe every Member of this body certainly shares the fundamental  understanding that our Armed Forces must have the ability to defend  themselves and our citizens against foreign enemies. Indeed, the  purpose of the NDAA is to provide the authorizations that are necessary  to ensure the Department of Defense is in a position to defend the  United States and our citizens.   In my opinion, in that respect, this amendment is not necessary. For  anyone who argues that the Romney language is somehow necessary because  of the Udall amendment that we will be voting on tomorrow, I say reread  the Udall amendment. It includes an explicit exception for self- defense.   I am concerned that this administration will seek to twist the Romney  amendment into something that is completely unrecognizable, something  that we are not voting on today, and something that has no basis in  law. As a legal matter, the amendment does nothing more than to  explicitly provide the authority to use funds under the act to ensure  this ability.   Let me be clear. This amendment does nothing more than that. Either  implicitly or explicitly, it does not authorize the use of military  force. Let me repeat. It is not an AUMF. An explicit authorization  would have to come to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee following  serious and substantive engagement by the executive branch.   It is no secret that there are some in this administration who are  eager to engage militarily with Iran. This week, the President himself  argued that he does not have to go to Congress to seek authorization.  But those who don't want to completely bypass our congressional  prerogative will be grasping at any purported source of authority that  could justify, in their minds, that Congress has authorized these  actions.   Look no further than the Secretary of State, who is purportedly  pushing the bogus legal theory that the 2001 AUMF, which Congress  passed in the wake of 9/11, somehow provides authority to use force  against Iran. Apparently, Secretary Pompeo is not dissuaded by the  facts. The plain language of the 2001 AUMF does not extend to Iran.  Congress did not intend for the 2001 AUMF to cover Iran, and neither  Republican nor Democratic Presidents who have operated pursuant to this  AUMF have claimed such authority.   Against this backdrop and a President who has evaded Congress in  unprecedented and unlawful ways, we must make crystal clear that the  Romney amendment cannot be abused by those in this administration who  appear to be desperate to build a case that the President has all of  the authority he needs to take us into war with Iran.   We cannot leave anything up to chance when it comes to the choice of  whether we send our sons and daughters into war. I believe we should be  having a serious conversation about our use of military force and about  what constitutes self-defense and attacks on our allies.   I am pleased that the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee has  previously committed to holding these hearings, and I believe we should  commence with hearings with multiple stakeholders, including the  administration itself. Previous administrations have sent up  representatives to explain to Congress their rationale for war or to  explain the type of authorizations they are seeking. We should demand  nothing less from this administration.   I support the amendment, and I look forward to continuing appropriate  oversight over the executive branch's pursuit of military action around  the world.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I come to the floor once again to speak  about a humanitarian crisis that is not taking place in Yemen or in  Syria or in any foreign country but, rather, right here at the southern  border of the United States.   They say a picture speaks a thousand words, but I think it is even  more than that. Photographs have the power to cut through noise, speak  the truth, and invoke action.   We all remember the heartbreaking image of a little boy who was  covered in ash while he sat in an ambulance in Syria. It told us all we  needed to know about acts of mass murder committed by Bashar al-Assad.  Likewise, we remember the look in the eyes of the malnourished girl who  was on the brink of death in Yemen--one of more than 85,000 children to  have succumbed to hunger during Saudi Arabia's disastrous bombing  campaign. Yet the photo I have brought to the floor today has shaken me  to the core as a father, as a grandfather, as a son of immigrants, and  above all else, as an America.   Like the other photographs I mentioned, this one tells a story too.  This one speaks an ugly truth, and that truth is that President Trump's  cruel, inhumane, and un-American border policies have failed. They have  failed to make us safer. They have failed to reduce migration to our  border. They have also failed to live up to the American values that  define our leadership around the world.   We will never forget this heartbreaking photo. More importantly, we  will not forget the names of Oscar Alberto Martinez and his 23-month- old daughter, Valeria. They drowned in a desperate attempt to claim  asylum in the United States.   Oscar, Valeria, and Tania, her mother, fled El Salvador in the hopes  of seeking asylum in the United States.   The Washington Post reported:         They traveled more than 1,000 miles seeking it. . . . But       the farthest the family got was an international bridge in       Matamoros, Mexico. On Sunday, they were told the bridge was       closed and that they should return Monday. Aid workers told       The Post the line to get across the bridge was hundreds long.        The young family was desperate. Standing on the Mexican       side of the Rio Grande, America looked within reach. Martinez       and Valeria waded in. But before they all made it to the       other side, the river waters pulled the 25-year-old and his       daughter under and swept them away.    Later, when Mexican authorities recovered their bodies, Oscar and  Valeria were still clinging to each other.   Here in the United States, it is hard to imagine what kind of  desperate conditions would propel you to flee your home and embark on a  perilous journey in search of protection from a foreign nation.   Most of these families who arrive at our border come from Guatemala,  El Salvador, and Honduras--three countries that are collectively known  as the Northern Triangle. It is a region that is plagued by  transnational gang violence, weak institutions, and poverty. Young boys  are forced into servitude by gangs. Young girls are beaten and raped if  they refuse to become their girlfriends. Parents who try to protect  their children end up getting killed. These countries are among the  most dangerous in the world. In El Salvador, a woman is murdered every  19 hours, and in Honduras--the country with the highest homicide rate  in the world for women--a woman is killed every 16 hours.   To be blunt, these families face an impossible choice. It is either  stay and die or flee for a chance to live.   Well, if this horrific and tragic photograph does anything, I hope it  dispels us of the ludicrous notion that you can deter desperate  families from fleeing their homes in search of safety. That is how the  Trump administration describes its cruel policies at the border-- deterrence.   In the name of deterrence, it is tearing children and babies away  from their mothers and fathers. In the name of deterrence, it is  shutting down legitimate ports of entry, effectively encouraging  migrant families to seek more dangerous methods of getting into the  United States, like crossing the Rio Grande. In the name of deterrence,  children are being housed in unsanitary conditions, which leaves  infants in dirty diapers and children without soap or toothpaste.    Let me share with our colleagues just a few of the statements that  the children who have been kept in these abhorrent conditions have  made.   Said one 8-year-old boy:         They took us away from our grandmother, and now we are all       alone. They have not  [[Page S4611]]       given us to our mother. We have been here for a long time. I       have to take care of my little sister. She is very sad       because she misses our mother and grandmother very much. . .       . We sleep on a cement bench. There are two mats in the room,       but the big kids sleep on the mats, so we have to sleep on       the cement bench.    Consider the words of a 16-year-old girl:         We slept on mats on the floor, and they gave us aluminum       blankets. They took our baby's diapers, baby formula, and all       of our belongings. Our clothes were still wet, and we were       very cold, so we got sick. . . . I have been in the U.S. for       6 days, and I have never been offered a shower or been able       to brush my teeth. There is no soap, and our clothes are       dirty. They have never been washed.    Finally, here are the words of a 17-year-old mother:         I was given a blanket and a mattress, but then, at 3 a.m.,       the guards took the blanket and mattress. My baby was left       sleeping on the floor. In fact, almost every night, the       guards wake us at 3 a.m. and take away our sleeping       mattresses and blankets. . . . They leave babies, even little       babies of 2 or 3 months, sleeping on the cold floor. For me,       because I am so pregnant, sleeping on the floor is very       painful for my back and hips. I think the guards act this way       to punish us.    This is not the America I know. Yet this administration wants us to  forget who we are. This administration wants us to believe that if the  Government of the United States is cruel enough, that if it denies  those who seek asylum all semblances of humanity, that if we ignore  basic standards of child welfare, and that if we abandon fundamental  American values like respect for human rights, then desperate families  who flee Central America will stop coming here.   It is not true. The entire doctrine of deterrence is grounded in  hideous lies, beginning with the lie the President has fed the people  from the moment he launched his campaign in 2015--the lie that  immigrants are a threat to our security. President Trump has cast  immigrants as criminals and rapists and drug dealers when the truth is  that these migrants are the ones who are fleeing the criminals, the  rapists, and the drug dealers.   I am sick and tired of these lies, like when the President repeatedly  says he inherited the policy of family separation from the Obama  administration. That is a lie. The Trump administration masterminded  this despicable policy, pure and simple.   These cruel policies are not working. They have done nothing to stem  the tide of families who seek asylum in the United States. They have  done nothing to stabilize Central America and to alleviate the  conditions that force families to seek refuge here.   It is time to turn the page. There are so many alternatives to  detention that are available to the DHS that are far more humane and  far less costly to the taxpayers.   Consider the Obama administration's pilot program known as the family  case management system. It established procedures to treat migrant  families humanely as their cases moved forward. Pregnant women, nursing  mothers, or mothers with young children were given caseworkers who  helped to educate them on their rights and their responsibilities. They  were connected to community resources or to family in the country who  could help them.   According to an inspector general's report, the program was an  enormous success. It had a compliance rate of 99 percent. That means  that 99 percent of the time, families in the program showed up for  their ICE check-ins and appointments. Likewise, they showed up 100  percent of the time for their immigration court hearings. Tell me--how  many government programs work 100 percent of the time? It is very rare.  This one did, but that didn't stop President Trump from terminating it.  Even though it had a 99-percent compliance and check-in rate and had  100 percent who showed up for their hearings, oh, no. Evidently, that  was not good enough for the Trump administration, for it was far more  humane and far less costly to the taxpayers.   Beyond embracing alternatives to mass detention, we must ramp up  humanitarian assistance at the border. That is why I voted yesterday  for the House's emergency supplemental bill, which would provide  desperately needed support to on-the-ground organizations and would  better ensure the humane treatment of children who are in CBP custody.   The House bill included strong guardrails to prevent this White House  from using these funds to pursue its draconian detention practices and  mass deportation agenda. While the Senate bill fell short in these  areas, I hope the administration uses whatever money it receives to  ensure that the children are properly cared for--in a way that respects  basic human rights.   Solving this crisis will take more than humanitarian funding. If  President Trump were serious about reducing migration, he would be  working day and night to improve the conditions that are driving  families to flee Central America in the first place. Instead, he has  cut off aid to the Northern Triangle and has undermined critical U.S.  efforts to work with Central American governments to crack down on gang  violence, strengthen the rule of law, and alleviate poverty.   These programs were working, and the Trump administration knows it.  Why do I say that? In recent years, Congress has not only increased  funding for foreign assistance to Central America, but it has required  these governments to meet clear benchmarks in order to demonstrate  their progress in areas like combating drug trafficking and  strengthening their legal systems.   The Trump administration has acknowledged the effectiveness of these  programs on several occasions. In fact, it has sent Congress not one,  not two, but nine different reports that have certified these  benchmarks have been met.   Here is just one of them that has been signed by Secretary of State  Mike Pompeo:         I hereby certify that the central government of El Salvador       is informing its citizens of the dangers of the journey to       the southwest border of the United States; combating human       smuggling and trafficking; improving border security,       including preventing illegal migration, human smuggling and       trafficking, and trafficking of illicit drugs and other       contraband; and cooperating with the United States Government       agencies and other governments in the region to facilitate       the return, repatriation, and reintegration of illegal       migrants arriving at the southwest border of the United       States who do not qualify for asylum consistent with       international law.    This one is dated August 11, 2018. There are nine certifications by  the Secretary of State saying that the programs we had going on and  working in Central America were, in fact, working.   But we all know this President has no respect for facts or evidence- based reality. His decision to punish Central American governments for  the migration crisis by slashing aid is only making the crisis worse.  It absolutely makes no sense.   If we want to reduce migration from Central America, we need a bold  strategy to address the root causes driving families in fear from their  home. That is why my colleagues and I have introduced the Central  America Reform and Enforcement Act. Our bill would dramatically expand  U.S. engagement in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala through proven  programs that help strengthen the rule of law, combat violence, and  build prosperity. Our bill would also minimize border crossings by  expanding refugee processing centers in the region in an effort to  reduce demand at the border, and, finally, it includes several measures  to protect the welfare of children and ensure efficient, fair, and  timely processing of asylum seekers.   Now, this administration may wish the Northern Triangle's serious  problems would just go away, but the longer we let these conditions  fester, the greater this migration crisis will become.   There is a very real possibility that President Trump views a growing  crisis at the border as an asset in his path to reelection in 2020. The  President believes his best shot at winning elections is to stoke fear  of migrant children who pose no threat but desperately need the safe  embrace of Lady Liberty.   After all, President Trump cannot campaign on solving the student  loan debt crisis or providing Americans with better, cheaper  healthcare, or making sure that big corporations pay their fair share.  He has failed on all these fronts and more. The only play left in the  Trump playbook is to blame immigrants for America's problems instead of  solving America's problems.   That is what I call the politics of hate. The politics of hate is  what led  [[Page S4612]]  President Trump to attempt to ban Muslims from traveling to the United  States. The politics of hate is what led President Trump to end DACA  and threaten 800,000 Dreamers with deportation to countries they have  never called home--young people who through no choice of their own were  brought to the United States, the only country they have ever pledged  allegiance to is the United States and to the flag of the United  States. The only national anthem they know is the Star Spangled Banner.  The only place they have ever called home is America.   The politics of hate is what led President Trump to attack TPS  holders and jeopardize thousands of parents to American-born children.  The politics of hate is what led the administration to forcibly  separate nearly 2,800 children from their parents--and maybe thousands  more, because they don't even have a recordkeeping system of where all  of these children are. That is a policy that will forever be a stain on  our history.   The politics of hate is what led President Trump to tweet out his  plan to send ICE agents into our communities to terrorize our towns and  cities with mass arrests and mass deportations. It is a plan that would  leave millions of U.S.-born American citizen children wondering: Why  mom never came to pick me up at school or why dad never made it home  for dinner. It is a plan that would inflict traumatic and irreparable  harm on American children who would not only have to reckon with the  loss of a parent but the loss of the income provided by that parent.  The politics of hate led to the remain-in-Mexico policy, which forces  asylum seekers to remain in Mexico amid dangerous conditions.   Indeed, just yesterday, U.S. asylum officers requested that the  courts block the Trump administration from requiring migrants to stay  in Mexico, stating it is ``fundamentally contrary to the moral fabric  of our Nation and our international domestic legal obligations.''   Now, in the latest action, I fear it is the politics of hate that  explain the awful press reports we heard today suggesting that  President Trump plans to end a program that protects undocumented  members of U.S. military families from deportation. Imagine that-- someone who wears the uniform of the United States, who may serve  halfway around the world in service to the Nation, who risks their  lives, and now you are going to take the one program that put their  mind at ease--that their spouse or child, who may be undocumented in  the country and had the ability to stay because of that servicemember's  service, and now you are going to say you are going to deport their  children, their spouse.   Well, if someone is willing to wear the uniform of the United States,  pledge allegiance to our flag, and risk their life to defend this  Nation in battle, the last thing we ought to do is to deport their  loved ones.   The Trump administration's policies at our border have brought us  nothing but chaos, despair, and shame. We cannot let the politics of  fear and hate degrade the values that make America great.   We cannot wall off our country from the strife gripping Central  America. We cannot tweet our way out of this problem. We must lead our  way out of this problem with real solutions and strategies that bring  sanity, dignity, and order back to our border and prevent the kind of  tragic loss of human life we saw earlier this week on the banks of the  Rio Grande. We are just better than this. We are just better than this.   If my colleagues do not raise their voices, then, they are complicit  to this. History will judge us poorly.   I hope we will have bipartisan voices who say: This is not who we  are; this is not what we stand for. And we can work toward making sure  this tragic photograph never ever happens again.   I yield the floor.
