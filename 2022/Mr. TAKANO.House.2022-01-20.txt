 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 860, I call up  the bill (H.R. 4673) to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide  for the automatic enrollment of eligible veterans in patient enrollment  system of Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, and  ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 4673, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4673, as amended, my  bill, the Ensuring Veterans' Smooth Transition, or EVEST Act.   I have made suicide prevention a top priority for the House Veterans'  Affairs Committee. Last Congress, we passed bipartisan, bicameral  mental health legislative packages, including the Commander John Scott  Hannon Veterans Mental Health Improvement Act and the Veterans COMPACT  Act. This Congress, we continued this work by passing the Sergeant  Ketchum Rural Veterans Mental Health Act into law, but there is always  more to do.   EVEST builds on our work and finally closes one of the most glaring  gaps for veterans being able to successfully access high-quality VA  health services, the enrollment process. We shouldn't be trying to hide  VA care from those who earned it.   We know that the months following transition out of the military can  be very stressful and particularly risky for new veterans in terms of  mental health. With the EVEST Act, servicemembers will be automatically  enrolled in VA care during their transition out of the military, with  the choice to opt out. This helps simplify the process and prevents  veterans from potentially missing out on lifesaving care. It also keeps  veterans from having to opt into VA care later and attempt to navigate  a new bureaucracy all on their own.   The symptoms of PTSD can be significantly improved in veterans who  receive prompt mental healthcare. A 2014 study led by researchers at  the San Francisco VA Medical Center looked at nearly 40,000 Iraq and  Afghanistan veterans who received VA mental  [[Page H258]]  healthcare between 2001 and 2011 and had a post-deployment diagnosis of  PTSD. They found that veterans who sought and received care soon after  the end of their service had lower levels of PTSD upon follow-up a year  after they initiated care. Each year that a veteran waited to initiate  treatment, there was about a 5 percent increase in the odds of their  PTSD either not improving or getting worse.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the study from the San Francisco  VA Medical Center.                   [From Psychiatric Services, Dec. 2014]   Timing of Mental Health Treatment and PTSD Symptom Improvement Among                       Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans   (By Shira Maguen, Ph.D.; Erin Madden, M.P.H.; Thomas C. Neylan, M.D.;  Beth E. Cohen, M.D., M.A.S.; Daniel Bertenthal, M.P.H.; Karen H. Seal,                               M.D., M.P.H.)                                  Objective         This study examined demographic, military, temporal, and       logistic variables associated with improvement of       posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among Iraq and       Afghanistan veterans who received mental health outpatient       treatment from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)       health care system. The authors sought to determine whether       time between last deployment and initiating mental health       treatment was associated with a lack of improvement in PTSD       symptoms.                                   Methods         The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of existing       medical records of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who enrolled       in VA health care, received a postdeployment PTSD diagnosis,       and initiated treatment for one or more mental health       problems between October 1, 2007, and December 31, 2011, and       whose records contained results of PTSD screening at the       start of treatment and approximately one year later       (N=39,690).                                   Results         At the start of treatment, 75% of veterans diagnosed as       having PTSD had a positive PTSD screen. At follow-up, 27% of       those with a positive screen at baseline had improved, and       43% of those with a negative screen at baseline remained       negative. A negative PTSD screen at follow-up was associated       with female gender, older age, white race, having never       married, officer rank, non-Army service, closer proximity to       the nearest VA facility, and earlier initiation of treatment       after the end of the last deployment.                                 Conclusions         Interventions to reduce delays in initiating mental health       treatment may improve veterans' treatment response. Further       studies are needed to test interventions for particular       veteran subgroups who were less likely than others to improve       with treatment. (Psychiatric Services 65:1414-1419, 2014;       doi: 10.1176/appi.ps.201300453)        Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most       common mental disorders among veterans returning from recent       deployments. Yet, despite the availability of evidence-based       treatments, there are multiple barriers to initiating mental       health treatment. Many military personnel and veterans who       report barriers to mental health care do not seek treatment       or postpone seeking it.        Among veterans who do seek mental health care, the time lag       is quite significant. In a previous study, we found that       recently returning veterans with psychiatric diagnoses had       delayed initiating mental health care at the U.S. Department       of Veterans Affairs (VA) by a median of over two years after       their last deployment ended. Delays in care can translate       into delays in symptom and functional improvement, hindering       readjustment to civilian life, family, and community.        Some studies have examined predictors of PTSD symptom       worsening, but outside of randomized treatment trials, only a       few studies have examined variables that are associated with       PTSD symptom improvement. In other words, few studies have       examined variables that are associated with PTSD symptom       improvement in a naturalistic fashion, by allowing treatment       initiation or engagement to vary among participants.       Furthermore, even fewer studies have examined these questions       among military personnel or veterans, particularly among       those who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Existing       studies have found a few variables that were associated with       PTSD symptom improvement. For example, service members       serving in multiple deployments demonstrated greater symptom       improvement than those serving in a single deployment. For       other demographic variables, the association with improvement       is unclear. For example, although we know that female gender       may be associated with the development of PTSD, it is not       clear how gender is related to PTSD symptom improvement.        If we can better understand why some individuals improve,       we can better understand the course and trajectories of PTSD       and how to best contribute to individuals' recovery. This       study evaluated demographic, military, temporal, and logistic       variables that may be associated with PTSD symptom       improvement. We were particularly interested in whether       seeking mental health treatment sooner was associated with       improvement in PTSD symptoms.                                   Methods       Data source and extraction        We conducted a retrospective analysis of existing medical       records from the VA's Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)/      Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)/Operation New Dawn (OND)       roster, a national database of veterans who have separated       from OEF/OIF/OND military service and who have enrolled in VA       health care. Veterans of OEF served predominantly in       Afghanistan, and veterans of OIF and OND served predominantly       in Iraq. We linked the OEF/OIF/OND roster database, which       contains veterans' demographic and military service       information, to the Decision Support System's National Data       Extract of pharmacy data and the VA National Patient Care       Database, which provides VA visit dates and associated       diagnostic codes from the International Classification of       Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM).       These data are derived from electronic medical records       generated during clinical visits. Visits to mental health       outpatient and primary care services are categorized by       clinic stop codes. Mental health outpatient services include       visits to integrated care clinics providing primary care and       mental health care. Fee basis codes designate care that is       rendered at non-VA facilities and reimbursed by the VA but do       not capture all non-VA care, such as care reimbursed by       private insurance. The results of PTSD screening were       extracted from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse.        All analyses were restricted to OEF/OIF/OND veterans who       had received a diagnosis of PTSD (ICD-9-CM code 309.81)       during two or more clinical encounters that occurred after       the end of their last deployment and before December 31,       2012; had utilized mental health outpatient care between       October 1, 2007 (beginning of nationwide primary care       screenings), and December 31, 2012, and had not made any       prior use of VA care; and had received PTSD screenings at       both the start of treatment (up to three months before and       one month after the first mental health visit) and on at       least one other occasion occurring at least one year later       (N=39,690). Of veterans who newly entered mental health       treatment, 83% had a baseline screen for PTSD, and of those       with a baseline screen, 50% had a follow-up screen during the       period beginning one year later. The follow-up screen that       was closest in proximity to the one-year follow-up date was       utilized.      Measures        PTSD symptoms were assessed by using the Primary Care PTSD       Screen (PC-PTSD), the PTSD Checklist (PCL), or both. Both       measures were included in order to capture the most       representative sample, given that the PC-PTSD screen is       mainly used in VA primary care settings and other non-mental       health settings and the PCL is used primarily in VA mental       health settings. The PC-PTSD, a brief four-item screen given       annually and after each deployment, is designed to detect       possible PTSD symptoms. The screen yields binary responses       (yes or no) for each of four PTSD symptom clusters:       reexperiencing, avoidance, emotional numbing, and       hyperarousal; a score of 3 designates a positive PTSD screen       for veterans.        The PCL is a 17-item measure, with each item rating the       presence of a different symptom over the past month on a 5-      point Likert scale, from not at all to a little bit,       moderately, quite a bit, and extremely. The PCL has been       shown to have very good internal consistency, and it       correlates strongly with other measures of PTSD symptoms. The       PCL also demonstrates high diagnostic efficiency (.90).       Within the VA, the PCL is mainly administered at the       discretion of treating clinicians, typically to track patient       progress during the course of mental health treatment. For       the purposes of this study, symptoms rated as moderately or       above on the PCL were considered present. PTSD symptoms from       the PCL were combined in order to create indicators that       paralleled each of the four symptom cluster proxies from the       PC-PTSD. The validity of the mapping of PCL questions onto       PC-PTSD items was tested by examining concordance between the       two screens given at the VA on the same date. For the       purposes of validation, all OEF/OIF/OND veterans who were       administered the PCL and the PC-PTSD on the same date (not       restricted to our study sample) were included (N=53,756),       with a total of 57,889 instances in which a given veteran had       both a PC-PTSD and PCL administered on the same day. [A table       describing the mapping of the PCL to the PC-PTSD and       agreement between the two instruments is available online as       a data supplement to this article.]        We created a composite variable, referred to as the PTSD       screen result; endorsing three or more symptoms on either       measure constituted a positive screen for PTSD.      Dependent variable        The binary dependent variable, a negative (versus positive)       PTSD screen result, was defined as a score of <3 at follow-up       on the PTSD screen. This outcome comprised PTSD screen       results that had improved or had remained negative compared       with baseline results (versus having worsened or remained       positive).      Independent variables        The main independent variable was time until initiation of       mental health outpatient treatment, which was defined for       each person as the time (in years) from the end of the last       deployment until the first mental health  [[Page H259]]       outpatient visit. Other independent variables included date       of birth, gender, race-ethnicity, marital status, and       military characteristics. Details about each person's       military characteristics (armed forces branch [Army, Marines,       Navy or Coast Guard, or Air Force], rank, component type       [National Guard and reserves or active duty], and number of       deployments [one or multiple deployments]) were extracted       from the OEF/OIF/OND roster. Information about the type of       VA facility nearest to the individual and the distance to       the closest facility was derived from the OEF/OIF/OND       roster by the VA planning and system support group.        The following independent variables were treated as       potential confounders because each could account for change       in PTSD symptoms: mental health outpatient treatment       utilization, defined as the number of mental health clinic       visits between the start of mental health treatment and the       follow-up screen; regular use of primary care services,       defined as a mean interval between visits of six months or       fewer; and use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor       (SSRI) for 12 consecutive weeks or more, as encoded in VA       outpatient pharmacy data.      Analysis        We used logistic regression analysis to examine the       association of independent predictor variables with a       negative PTSD screen result. In separate logistic regression       models, we examined predictors of PTSD screen results for       each of the four PTSD symptom clusters (reexperiencing,       avoidance, emotional numbing, and hyperarousal). The main       predictors of interest included time from the end of the last       deployment to initiation of mental health outpatient       treatment, gender, age, race-ethnicity, marital status,       military component, rank, branch, number of deployments, and       distance to and type of nearest VA facility. The multi-      variable analysis adjusted for potential confounders of the       association between changes in PTSD symptoms and predictors.       Potential confounders included baseline PTSD screen result,       timing of follow-up screen, regular utilization of primary       care services, total mental health outpatient treatment       utilization, and SSRI use. Primary care and mental health       service utilization and antidepressant use were included only       for adjustment purposes because of potential biases due to       confounding by indication. More specifically, persons who are       more symptomatic are more likely to utilize health services       and antidepressant medications.        We tested interactions of demographic and military       predictors with each other and, separately, with time to       initiation of mental health outpatient treatment. As       mentioned above, the study combined results for veterans       whose PTSD screen result had improved from baseline with       those for veterans whose screen result had remained negative.       To determine whether it was valid to combine these scores, we       tested interactions of baseline screen results with       demographic and military factors and, separately, with time       from the end of the last deployment to initiation of mental       health outpatient treatment. All tests were two-tailed.       Analyses were performed by using SAS, version 9.3. The study       was approved by the Committee on Human Research, University       of California, San Francisco, and the San Francisco VA       Medical Center.                                   RESULTS         The sample was 90% male, with a meanSD age of       30.58.16; 57% were white, 11% were black, 11%       were Hispanic, and 21% were of other or unknown race-      ethnicity. At the time of initiation of mental health       outpatient treatment, 75% of the veterans screened positive       for PTSD, having endorsed at least three of the four PTSD       symptom clusters on the PTSD screen (Table 1). After at least       one year (mean follow-up=2.37.93 years), 27%       (N=7,908) of those with a positive screen at baseline had       improved, and 43% (N=4,329) of those with a negative screen       at baseline continued to screen negative.        Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the       following characteristics were associated with a negative       PTSD screen result: women compared with men, older versus       younger age at first mental health outpatient visit, officer       rank compared with enlisted rank, service in branches of the       military other than the Army, and negative PTSD screen at       baseline (Table 2).        Blacks were less likely than whites to have a negative       screen result (Table 2), and this difference persisted after       adjustment for time from the end of the last deployment to       mental health outpatient treatment. Similar to findings of       previous studies, the median interval between the end of the       last deployment and the use of services was about three       months longer for blacks than for whites (p<.001; data not       shown). The reduced likelihood among blacks versus whites of       a negative PTSD screen result was partly driven by the 7%       greater probability that blacks would screen positive for       PTSD at follow-up after having screened negative at baseline       (p<.001; results not shown).        Veterans who were married were slightly less likely than       those who were never married to have a negative PTSD screen       result. Veterans who lived more than ten miles away from the       nearest VA facility were less likely than veterans who lived       closer to have a negative screen result. Veterans who lived       closer to a community-based outpatient clinic than to a VA       medical center were also less likely to have a negative       screen result.        Notably, veterans who waited longer to initiate mental       health outpatient treatment were less likely to have a       negative screen result. Figure 1 illustrates the decreasing       probability of a negative screen result with each year that       passed after the end of the last deployment.        Logistic regression analyses found similar patterns of       association between predictor variables and PTSD screen       results for each of the four PTSD symptom clusters (results       not shown).                                  DISCUSSION         A number of demographic, military, temporal, and logistic       variables were associated with symptom improvement or with       continuing to score below the threshold for a positive PTSD       screen. Although temporal variables are rarely examined, we       found that greater time to mental health outpatient treatment       engagement was negatively associated with PTSD symptom       improvement. More specifically, veterans who waited longer to       get mental health treatment were less likely than veterans       who sought treatment sooner to experience PTSD symptom       improvement during the study period. This finding sheds light       on the importance of continuing to better understand barriers       to mental health treatment, particularly given that less than       half of veterans with mental health problems seek care and       those who seek care do so after significant delays.        Outreach efforts to help veterans engage in treatment in a       timely manner are critical and may, in turn, help with PTSD       symptom improvement over time. Intervening early when mental       health problems are first detected should be a priority.       Given that integrated primary and mental health care is now       becoming available at many VA health care facilities, this       ``one-stop shop'' model provides an optimal way to decrease       time to seeking mental health care. Veterans in primary       care who screen positive for any mental health problems       can receive immediate mental health assistance within an       integrated care model, which may assist with the stigma of       receiving care in a mental health setting. Indeed,       veterans who received integrated primary care were more       likely to receive a mental health evaluation or care       within a month.        We also found that female gender was associated with       greater PTSD symptom improvement compared with male gender.       Although civilian studies found that females are at greater       risk of PTSD, findings in military samples have been mixed,       with some studies finding no gender differences. In addition,       we recently found that although both genders experienced a       delay in engaging in minimally adequate mental health care       (eight mental health outpatient visits within a year), female       veterans received minimally adequate mental health care about       two years sooner than male veterans, which may explain why       they achieved greater symptom improvement.        Black veterans were less likely, but only modestly so, to       demonstrate PTSD symptom improvement, compared with their       white counterparts, and this difference was not explained by       longer time from the end of the last deployment to mental       health outpatient treatment initiation. That is not       surprising, given that studies have consistently found that       unmet treatment needs are greatest in underserved groups,       including racial-ethnic minority groups). It may be that       veterans from racial-ethnic minority groups face particular       barriers to treatment that are important to acknowledge, and       more research is needed in this area in order to optimize       outcomes. Furthermore, other variables, such as differential       rates of traumatic stressors and preexisting conditions, are       important to further explore and may explain some of these       differences.        Officers were more likely than enlisted personnel to       experience PTSD symptom improvement. One possible explanation       is that officer status may be a proxy for higher education;       research has shown that lower levels of education are       associated with chronic trajectories of PTSD. However, other       variables that we were not able to measure, such as social       support in the aftermath of trauma, may also explain some of       these findings.        A number of limitations should be considered when       interpreting these findings. First, this study was conducted       with a population of treatment-seeking veterans who had at       least one visit to a VA health care facility. Therefore, our       results should not be generalized to all OEF/OIF/OND military       personnel or veterans. Second, we selected a population of       veterans who served in support of OEF/OIF/OND, and,       therefore, these results should not be generalized to       veterans of other eras or to veterans from other countries.       Third, ICD-9-CM diagnoses were acquired from administrative       health records and were not verified with standardized       diagnostic measures. A related concern is the combined use of       two separate validated tools, the PCL and the PC-PTSD. We       used both the PCL and the PC-PTSD in order to obtain the most       representative sample and because they are the measures used       by the VA system. Furthermore, we found that the method we       used was statistically reliable. Nonetheless, combining two       separate validated tools may have resulted in variations in       these data. Future studies should continue to examine the       validity and reliability of this method.        Fourth, because of the ways in which data appear in the VA       administrative database, we were not able to distinguish       between the types of mental health treatments that veterans       were receiving, such as evidence-based treatment for PTSD or       other mental health  [[Page H260]]       problems versus supportive therapy; rather, we could account       only for number of visits. We hope to have better indicators       of evidence-based treatment for PTSD in the future so that       the particular types of care that veterans receive can be       examined more closely in relation to symptom improvement.       Fifth, because we used administrative data, we were not able       to examine third variables that may be associated with our       outcome, including severe avoidance symptoms, interpersonal       difficulties, and poor attachment, among others. Finally, we       were able to include only veterans whose PTSD symptoms were       measured during at least two occasions; those who dropped out       after one visit are not as well represented.                                 Conclusions         Veterans who waited longer to get mental health treatment       were less likely to experience PTSD symptom improvement       during the study period. Furthermore, improving barriers for       black, male, younger, rural, lower-ranking, and possibly less       well educated veterans is an important priority, given our       findings. Models that integrate primary care and mental       health care may be an optimal way to help expedite veteran       treatment engagement.

A smooth care transition from DOD to VA can help support  veterans as they adjust to the next phase of their lives and provide  easy access to healthcare should any challenges arise.   Everyday Americans find it difficult and frustrating to sign up for  healthcare. Now, imagine that you have just come off Active-Duty  military service where, for years you were told when and where to show  up for your healthcare. You probably heard something about VA services  during your transition assistance program but, frankly, you were  focused on everything you had to do to finalize your separation from  the military and possibly looking for new employment and relocating  your family.   Now, after having separated from the military, you are a veteran, and  maybe for the first time you have to figure out how to check your  eligibility for VA healthcare and navigate the system while potentially  also facing some new stress in your personal and family life. This is  completely avoidable with EVEST, which simply enrolls you in the VA  healthcare for which you are already eligible, ensuring that when you  need VA, there aren't any unnecessary roadblocks to seeing a doctor.   Now, let me say that again. This legislation has nothing to do with a  veteran's eligibility, nor does it change VA standards or who is  eligible. It only connects eligible veterans to VA care faster and  easier.   We know that veterans are much more likely to use VA services and  care when the process to enroll is simple, and we know that VA care is  world class. EVEST is a straightforward tool that will allow us to  simplify the transition process and take steps toward preventing  veteran suicide.   Automatic enrollment is something policymakers and veterans service  organizations and stakeholders have been trying to advance for years,  and with EVEST it will finally become a reality.   Paralyzed Veterans of America and Disabled American Veterans have  formally endorsed this legislation. The Nurses Organization of Veterans  Affairs, the American Federation of Government Employees, the Veterans  Healthcare Policy Institute, and the American Psychological Association  also support EVEST.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from  the Nurses Organization of Veterans Affairs and the Veterans Healthcare  Policy Institute.                                             Nurses Organization of                                                Veterans Affairs,                                                   January 14, 2021.      Chairman Mark Takano,      Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Takano: On behalf of the nearly 3,000 members       of the Nurses Organization of Veterans Affairs (NOVA) we       would like to offer our strong support for your bill, H.R.       4673, Ensuring Veterans' Smooth Transition Act (EVEST).        As nurses, caring for Veterans is our number one priority.       Your bill will provide Veterans with the option of enrolling       in VA healthcare during the critical months following their       transition to civilian life and ensure servicemembers       separating from active duty receive the critical health care       to which they are eligible.        Your bill will also help eliminate barriers to care--      including those who may not know they are even eligible to       receive care at VA. It will also help to assure the Veteran       that they are not alone in seeking care for any physical or       mental health condition acquired during their military       service.        Offering automatic enrollment with an opt out will help to       lessen the burden of navigating the VA healthcare system at a       time when they are dealing with many challenges as they       transition to civilian life.        NOVA believes that most Veterans will find care provided       them within the VA is suited to their individual and complex       needs and cannot be matched in the private sector. Many       providers at the VA are Veterans themselves so they       understand what it means to serve and are trained to provide       a Whole Health approach to the Veteran patients' health and       well-being.        Thank you for your leadership on this issue and your       continued support for Veterans and the healthcare       professionals who care for them.            Sincerely,      Taryn-Janae Wilcox-Olson, MHS, RN,        President, Nurses Organization of Veterans Affairs (NOVA).                                   ____                                                 Veterans Healthcare                                         Policy Institute (VHPI),                                                   January 19, 2022.      Endorsement of the ``Ensuring Veterans' Smooth Transition           Act''        The Veterans Healthcare Policy Institute (VHPI) is pleased       to formally endorse House bill H.R. 4673, the ``Ensuring       Veterans' Smooth Transition Act'' or ``EVEST Act.'' The EVEST       Act creates a process to automatically enroll Veterans who       are eligible, upon their discharge from the military, into       the VA for medical care, with an opportunity to opt out. Many       Veterans do not receive the health care they have earned       through their service because they are unaware of their       eligibility or are too overwhelmed during the complex period       of transitioning from active duty. By automatically enrolling       Veterans into the VA system, many more eligible veterans will       be able to utilize valuable VA health care benefits. Many       lives will be saved.        This is one of the most important bills in many years, and       we are pleased to support its passage.     Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank Speaker Pelosi and Leader  Hoyer for considering this legislation today, and I urge the rest of my  colleagues to support this vital legislation to increase access to care  and ensure a smooth transition to civilian life for veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I reiterate that we should not be hiding the care that our veterans  have earned. Let me quickly say that this bill has been in the public  domain for 2 years. It was reintroduced last summer, and the minority  had over 6 months to talk with us and the VA about it.   Furthermore, the committee has held six hearings on suicide  prevention and transition since 2019. The common sense of this bill  shines through.   And let me also add that regarding the capacity of VA--and I am glad  that the ranking member has entered the statement of administrative  support into the Record; that statement clearly says and declares the  administration's support and its willingness to work with the  administration.   Data shows that VA enrollment has been going down in recent years,  and while new enrollment hovers around 400,000 per year, it used to be  double that, around one million per year, and using current  assumptions, VA projects veteran enrollment in VHA to remain relatively  steady from 2019 to 2029.   I am very confident about VA's ability to absorb the additional  veterans that will take advantage of VA's world-class healthcare.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  Mrvan), my good friend and a member of the House Committee on Veterans  Affairs and the chairman of the Subcommittee on Technology  Modernization.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to add that, in response to the esteemed ranking member, VA  formally supports this legislation and has been discussing auto  enrollment for years.   VA has already been working to make transition into VA healthcare  smoother with Solid Start and will soon have data showing that warm  handoffs have a positive impact on veteran outcomes without  overwhelming the VA system.   In response to the criticism that VSOs have not had input, I want to  point out that VSOs, including Paralyzed Veterans of America and  Disabled American Veterans, have already formally endorsed EVEST. Why?  Because the common sense of this legislation shines through.   All VSOs have had a chance to weigh in, and many did. The Nurses  Organization of Veterans Affairs, the American Federation of Government  Employees, the Veterans Health Policy Institute, and the American  Psychological Association also support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Correa), my good friend and a former member of the House Veterans'  Affairs Committee who now serves on the Agriculture Committee, Homeland  Security Committee, and House Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me say that the amendments that we are considering to this bill  today, which I consider friendly, will address many of the ranking  member's concerns about the reaching out.   I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Himes), my  good friend who serves on the Financial Services Committee and the  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me just say, in response to my friend, the esteemed  ranking member, that his MTR, which would delay implementation in order  to avoid harm to our veterans, dare I say that the harm is in the  delay.   I am reminded of a quote from the VFW's Pat Murray that we had at  yesterday's roundtable on toxic exposure: Our pay-for for this bill and  our pay-for, frankly, for all that we do for veterans was the ticket  that we sent servicemembers overseas to serve. I repeat: Our pay-for  was the ticket we sent servicemembers overseas to serve.   And a little further discussion on the pay-for issue: The  Congressional Budget Office does not estimate that this bill will  increase mandatory spending and does not require an offset. These are  the rules we play by.   Again, we are not creating new eligibility here. The only cost of  this bill is veterans seeking care that they are already eligible for.  We are all better off when veterans are seeking the care that they  need, and we should not be hiding that care for which they are  eligible.   Automatic enrollment in VA healthcare for eligible veterans is a  long-needed suicide prevention tool. We cannot put a price tag on  protecting the health and safety of our veterans. Many of these  veterans would go on to use VA healthcare even if they are not  automatically enrolled, and the minority does not give a compelling  reason why we should hinder or make that process more difficult for our  veterans.   Again, I repeat, we should not be hiding the care for which our  veterans are already eligible.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that all my colleagues join me in passing H.R.  4673, as amended, and I anticipate we will see a big bipartisan vote  today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 5 of House Resolution  860, I rise to offer the four amendments en bloc to H.R. 4673.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of these en bloc  amendments. Seamlessly connecting veterans with the benefits and care  they earned through their service is paramount to the transition  process.   The Delgado amendment No. 1 makes sure that VA can easily notify  veterans regarding care and services through mass texting. As  technology and communication methods improve, so should how VA uses  those capabilities to easily inform veterans of their benefits. Texting  eligible veterans to tell them they have been auto-enrolled in VA  healthcare is an effective, simple way to increase awareness of the  care available to them.   The Delgado amendment No. 2 requires GAO to submit a report to  determine the best methods to notify veterans regarding their automatic  enrollment in VA healthcare. This amendment will strengthen the  underlying bill and inform best practices for how VA can ensure  veterans have the information they need regarding their access to care  and services.   Getting information to veterans in an effective manner is crucial to  their transition into civilian life, and the Delgado amendment No. 2  will help improve how VA communicates an eligible veteran's enrollment  in VA healthcare so they can easily access the care they need.   The Hayes amendment requires that VA notify veterans who opt out of  automatic enrollment that they may elect to enroll at a later date. We  understand there will be some veterans who opt out for auto-enrollment  for a variety of reasons, but it is our duty that they know that the VA  will be waiting for them if their future needs change.   Ensuring VA adopts and scales best practices related to auto- enrollment while also learning from any issues that arise during its  rollout is important to the long-term effectiveness of the aims of H.R.  4673.   The Tlaib amendment requires the VA to submit a report a year after  the first veteran is auto-enrolled in VA healthcare to preserve lessons  learned from the rollout. This report will help improve auto-enrollment  for both the VA administrators implementing the program and veteran  users alike.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the en bloc amendments,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), my good friend who serves on the House  Committee on Armed Services as chairman of the Subcommittee on Seapower  and Projection Forces and the Committee on Education and Labor.                                time  1000     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib), my good friend and author of this amendment.  She serves on the Financial Services Committee, the Natural Resources  Committee and the Oversight and Reform Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Green), my good friend and member of the Financial Services  Committee where he is chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and  Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to  close. I ask all my colleagues to support me in supporting these four  amendments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Escobar amendment  to H.R. 4673.   Mr. Speaker, seamlessly connecting veterans with the benefits and  care they have earned through their service is paramount to the  transition process. The Escobar amendment extends the automatic  enrollment in VA healthcare to eligible veterans discharged within 90  days before enactment of the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, many of the 175,000 veterans who served in Operation  Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn are  unaware of their eligibility for 5 years of VA healthcare upon  separation. Automatically enrolling recently separated eligible  veterans into VA healthcare will support our aim to prevent veteran  suicides and improve their access to care during their transition to  civilian life.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Escobar amendment.
