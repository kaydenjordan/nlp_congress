 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the MORE Act.   This legislation is a very simple but very important piece of  legislation. It does three basic things.   Number one, it legalizes cannabis by removing it from the Controlled  Substance Act. Number two, it establishes a process to expunge  cannabis-related convictions. Number three, it taxes cannabis.   Mr. Speaker, it is time.   Thirty-seven States in our Nation have already legalized cannabis.  Even Canada has legalized cannabis, and other nations around the world  are legalizing cannabis. Even the Israelis are selling cannabis-related  medicine.   It is time, Mr. Speaker.   But this is just the start. Cannabis farmers can't enroll in crop  insurance. They can't receive the official organic designation. They  can't access USDA programs.   Mr. Speaker, it is well beyond time. Please vote for this  legislation. Vote for common sense. Let's vote for the MORE Act.
