 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Rutherford, a great friend and  colleague, for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize a bipartisan issue that threatens  the safety of our law enforcement officers and our communities in which  they serve, and we have a solution for it.   Enacted in 2004, the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, known as  LEOSA, established clear guidelines allowing experienced retired or  off-duty officers who maintain proper training to obtain certification  allowing him or her to carry concealed firearms. The desired purpose  was to create a shared national policy between States allowing off-duty  and retired officers to carry their firearms wherever they are, granted  they are qualified and received appropriate credentials.   As many of my colleagues know, LEOSA has enjoyed a long history of  support from both sides of the aisle. When it was first proposed by a  Republican, LEOSA was cosponsored by more than half of the House.   Subsequent amendments signed into law in 2010 and 2013 under  Democratic President Barack Obama expanded LEOSA's coverage to include  law enforcement officers in most Federal agencies as well as military  police. In both instances, reforms were sponsored by Democratic  Senators.                                time  2015    LEOSA has always been a bipartisan priority because it is a law  enforcement and public safety issue. It is not a Second Amendment or  gun rights issue. The same is true about improvements in H.R. 1156, the  LEOSA Reform Act, which I am sponsoring.   The LEOSA Reform Act seeks to correct a number of unintended gaps and  weaknesses in the original LEOSA bill. These gaps and weaknesses are  not due to intentional restrictions in the original statute. Rather,  they are areas in which the original statute is silent, resulting in  conflicting interpretations and unintended restrictions which  effectively limit the ability of off-duty and retired officers to carry  their firearms, and we want them to do it in a manner that is safest  for them and the public.   This lack of specific language defeats the original intent of the  law, which is to allow off-duty and retired officers to carry their  firearms wherever they go. Granted, they have to be qualified and have  to have received appropriate credentials. That is a given.   It also created an inconsistent implementation across States, leaving  many officers to either assume intended risk when carrying in accord  with LEOSA or decide not to carry at all.   The LEOSA Reform Act adds specific language to address these  unintended weaknesses, and in doing so will make existing law stronger  and more workable for those who seek its benefit while maintaining the  rigorous standards that currently apply.   The bill does not put more guns into our communities. Individuals  affected by this legislation already have the authority to carry  concealed weapons in most locations. Rather, H.R. 1156 will help ensure  guns that are already in the hands of trained and certified law  enforcement officers and retired officers can safely and legally be  carried wherever they may be.   In fact, the LEOSA Reform Act will help ensure firearms do not end up  in the hands of criminals by allowing law enforcement officers and  retired officers to keep their firearms safely on their person, rather  than being forced to leave them unattended in vehicles in parking lots  of locations that are currently restricted from carrying.   The public's need for rapid intervention by off-duty and retired  officers is made clear by the recent incident in California, where the  heroic actions of an off-duty Federal officer who ran and shot at the  synagogue gunman saved countless lives. It is an example that we see  repeatedly. With the rise of tragic shootings in our Nation, empowering  trained professionals to carry will allow them to respond more quickly  to emergencies and provide years of expertise to these situations.   I have heard from law enforcement officials throughout Nebraska's  Second District and the Nation on the importance these changes will  have on the lives of our community's heroes and their ability to  protect themselves and others. In fact, the LEOSA Reform Act has been  endorsed by 20 professional law enforcement organizations whose  membership, when combined, is representative of well over half of all  law enforcement in our country.   On National Police Week, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to join me in providing greater public safety for law enforcement  and our communities at home by cosponsoring the LEOSA Reform Act.  Officer safety and public safety is a bipartisan issue, and together we  must and can do better.   Madam Speaker, I will close with this: If I am in a situation where I  am being victimized, who do I want near me?   I would love to have a retired or off-duty policeman who is armed,  and this bill makes that more likely.
