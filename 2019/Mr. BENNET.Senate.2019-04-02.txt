 Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to the  bravery and service of PFC Frank K. Pantleo, a recently passed World  War II veteran from Pueblo, CO, who served with honor in the Pacific  Theater.   Private First Class Pantleo served in the U.S. Army in World War II  from 1943 to 1945 with the 132nd Engineer Combat Battalion. He  fearlessly aided in the Bismarck Archipelago Campaign, the Eastern  Mandates Campaign, the Southern Philippines Campaign, and the Ryukus  Campaign.   Private First Class Pantleo was awarded the American Service Medal,  the Asiatic Pacific Service Medal, the Philippine Liberation Ribbon  with one service star, the World War II Victory Medal, and the Good  Conduct Medal during his time in the service to this Nation.   Every day, men and women in uniform like Private First Class Pantleo  heroically serve on the frontlines of our Nation's defense. I stand  with Coloradans today to honor his sacrifice and his memory.                            ____________________
