 Mr. Speaker, America just went  through the largest health crisis and loss of life event in the modern  era. Due to the pandemic, we lost over 1.3 million Americans, including  my own mom and stepdad. That is why I have introduced the FLASH Act to  help strengthen our Nation's ability to respond to a public health  crisis.   I was the mayor of Long Beach during the pandemic and worked every  single day on the response. Both Governor Newsom and President Biden  called our pandemic response a national model. We moved quickly to  vaccinate 99 percent of seniors, protect frontline workers, and reopen  schools ahead of most major cities, but in the first months of the  pandemic, we struggled to get lifesaving equipment without Federal  help.   My bill will help the Department of Health and Human Services cut  through red tape to quickly buy and distribute PPE, tests, medical  supplies, and vaccines. We need this bill, and that is why I am urging  my colleagues to support this critical legislation.                            ____________________
