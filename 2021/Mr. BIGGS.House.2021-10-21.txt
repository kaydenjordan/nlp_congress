 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman (Mr. Babin), my  colleague on the House Border Security Caucus.   Mr. Speaker, you have heard a lot about numbers today. I want to just  tell you a little bit about some of the faces and individuals. I have  been from the Rio Grande Valley to San Diego, and back again, this  year. I get down to the border incredibly often; just down again last  week, down two weeks before that, down a few weeks before that. And  that is kind of way I live, because I live in Arizona and it is  affected and it is impacted.   I was down in RGV, the Rio Grande Valley, and you can go there in the  area of La Jolla. And you sit at the river, the Rio Grande River runs,  and you can go and you wait--this little fork in the road. We parked  the car. I had a CBP agent with me, had a couple Members of Congress.  It is nighttime. We are looking out and we see about 40 people  literally emerging from the river. They are dressed great.   But you know what? Most of them are kids under age 14, I would guess.  A little girl 7 years old, she is with her brother, 5. There is no mom.  There is no dad. There is no aunt or uncle. There is no one there to  take care of them. The coyote brought them across the river and  deposited them.   Do you know what would happen in the United States for us who are  citizens, who are legally here, if we had a 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-year-old  child and we put that child in the hands of a criminally-violent  person? That is what a coyote is; they are working for the cartels. And  we sewed into their britches a name and a phone number, or a city. We  put that child there; and then we were up in Detroit, or LA, or  Phoenix. And that coyote, the person we gave that child to, then turned  the child over to the Border Patrol to reunite with us.   Upon reunification, we would be charged with child abuse. But our  government is the logistics arm of the cartel, and we don't do that. We  reunite that child and we allow that mom and that child to remain in  the United States of America and we don't bring criminal charges. And  we don't remove from this country. Instead, we release with all the  benefits of our social welfare safety net, our education system, our  healthcare, the free phones, the housing--all of that. That is what we  do.   And down in Yuma, just recently, how about this, I am standing there  with some of my friends. We are standing literally next to the fence.  But the fence ends, and there is a space of several hundred yards. And  literally, we are getting pictures of us standing in front of this hole  in the fence.   Here comes a fellow. He is walking up, and so we stop and talk to  him.                                time  1800    Where are you from? Cuba. Where were you before that? I came from  Russia. I went from Cuba to Russian and then I went to Spain and then  to France and then to Mexico City, and then I got myself to Mexicali. I  took a bus from Mexicali to Yuma--actually, Los Algodones, which is  right across the border, and he walks dry across the dregs of that  point of the Colorado River.   I say: What are you doing here? I want to be in America. He wanted to  be an American.   We say: Well, why don't you sit right here? There is water. There is  a station where you can clean yourself up a little bit. Border Patrol  is going to be along in just a second.   That person is not an economic refugee. There is no credible fear. He  is traveling and wants to come to the United States of America.   Do you know what is going to happen to him if they don't title 42  him, which they are not doing many title 42s anymore? He is probably  already in the country somewhere. That is where that fellow is. He was  an engaging fellow, but, nonetheless, illegally in this country.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I was standing next to many piles--I couldn't even fit  them into the camera shot--of bollard fencing panels taller than me, $2  million worth of those bollard fences right there.   A little further down from where we were, there is another set of  bollard fencing, but they aren't welded together yet. They are not  panels yet. They are getting stolen, by the way.   Where we were was by the temporary headquarters of the contractors  who were there to put up the fence. You know what? They keep going to  work every day. You know why they keep going to work every day? They  got a contract, and they are getting paid to go there. But they can't  put the fence up because President Biden says you can't put the fence  up.    That is exactly right. Think about this, too. It is  inhumane, right, because we entice people to come here, and we know  that the cartels,  [[Page H5781]]  they control. I can't emphasize this enough. I was startled when I  heard this. The cartels control every person coming across the border.   Let me tell you what that fellow from Cuba, the Cuban national, said  to me. He said: Look, I will wait here for the Border Patrol to come  pick me up. Will I be molested while I wait?   Think of that. What kind of country are we that we entice people to  come here, and they put themselves in the hands of some of the most  ruthless criminal gangsters ever.   There are two internecine wars going on between the Gulf Cartel and  the Sinaloa Cartel right now. The brutality is phenomenal. It helps you  to know that they are not humane. These people that are coming over are  paying $700 in the Haitian group, most $4,000 to $7,000. They are  putting their lives in the hands of these very violent criminals.    That is correct. We have seen it all along the border,  whether it is Arizona, Texas, the New Mexico boot, California. The heat  is so great, except for right there at San Diego, but it is even hot  there. When it gets 120 degrees in the desert and they are coming  across, they got one gallon of water that they got somewhere along the  pike, and that is it. It is unrelenting, unremitting heat. We see this.    Here is another question. You got it in Del Rio?    And that was not organic?    It was organized. It was organized.   Down in southern Mexico right now, you have a group of 95,000-plus  forming up, mostly Haitians forming up, waiting. They have announced  that this Sunday is their departure date. We think a good share is  going to go to Yuma this time because we have a 7-mile gap in our  fencing down there.    I agree with you 100 percent. If they would enforce our  law, we wouldn't need to be standing here. We had the Attorney General  today come in.    We asked him some pointed questions. How many  prosecutions? Is it still illegal? Yes, it is still illegal to come  into the country.   Are you prosecuting anybody? Well, I suspect the answer is, no, they  are not prosecuting anybody, but they are not detaining anybody either.  The law, under title 8, says you must detain unless there is some legal  exemption from detention.   The vast majority that are coming across, the Haitians--we heard  about 10,000 to 12,000 that Secretary Mayorkas admitted to. They only  removed 2,000, and the real number was between 26,000 and 30,000 that  actually flowed through Del Rio, Mr. Roy.   What happened to the other 20-some-odd thousand? Well, they are now  released into the interior of the United States of America. That is  what is happening. This catch and release program is another  contravention of our law.    When you say that, I am reminded of the surge of 2019.  That surge in 2019 happened. I know you went down to the border  multiple times.    I went down to the border multiple times. I took codels  down to the border so folks could see how bad it was. That was my  President.    You know what? He was trying to enact policies to stop  that. They brought lawsuits to prevent stopping that.   Now that their administration has basically adopted an open borders  policy, a dangerous policy for the people coming across, a national  security issue for us, a national security threat for us, it is  crickets?    There are several. Title 42 came along a little bit later,  though. The most effective were the remain in Mexico policy and the  agreements with the Northern Triangle states. There were no incentives  in these care packages that came along of $1,400 every time anybody  came in illegally.   He started building the fence. He stopped the catch and release. He  ramped up the due process speed. He tried to get those folks with the  false asylum claims in, get them due process, and get them removed. He  was actually removing people who had removal orders.   We got 1.2 million people who had due process with removal orders in  this country today, and this administration has told the ICE officers:  Don't go out and find them. Don't enforce those removals.                                time  1815    Those policies were actually working, and title 42 when that came in,  that finished it off.   But do you know what you had most of all, Mr. Speaker?   You had a President who said: Do not come, you are not welcome.    Mr. Speaker, when you think about it, in 2018 we swore in  830,000 new U.S. citizens. In 2019 it was about 800,000. That is kind  of where it sits every year.   I had a young man who worked for me; his family were immigrants from  Mexico. Thirteen years it took for them to get citizenship--13 years.  And if they would have crossed the border illegally with the current  Democrat plan, they would have gotten amnesty.   Mr. Speaker, think about that. Good friends of ours, our neighbors,  same situation, 12, 14 years to get citizenship.   And do you know what, Mr. Speaker? I have to get back to this caravan  that is coming up.   Mr. Speaker, what do you think 95,000 people will do to a town of Del  Rio's size, which I think is 30,000, 36,000, something like that; or  Yuma which is a town the size of 80,000; or how about the town of  Douglass; or Naco, about 3,000; or Douglass, about 15,000?   What happens when they come in there?   We don't have facilities. They get processed and released. That is  what happens.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is right, 100 percent. Mr.  Speaker, think about the drug trafficking right now. When the cartels  want to bring in drugs, they flood a zone. Del Rio, they put all the  Haitians there.   Mr. Speaker, 224 miles of border went unprotected--unprotected--for 8  days. They had cameras, but they didn't have any bodies to go arrest  these people bringing the drugs in. We have got places in Arizona for  62 miles with absolutely the only fencing being a vehicle barrier. We  have got people coming in who are going through mountains.   We have mountains filled with scouts watching and telling these drug  carriers where they are coming in. They come on up, they pop out on  Interstate 8 and the intersection of Interstate 10 just south of  Phoenix. It is the number one drug trafficking corridor in the country.  They spit this stuff out all over the country, and now they are moving  into pills. They are moving into pills, counterfeit pills, and we have  no idea--they are made by some dude down in a garage.     Just on that, I have got to comment on this because when  the  [[Page H5783]]  gentleman said he had an American citizen, the driver, as an employee  of the cartel, we see that all up and down the border, and they want to  get youth to do it as well because they are not going to be prosecuted.    They are recruiting youth because they are not going to be  prosecuted as adults. They are going to get off easier.    Mr. Speaker, I agree 100 percent. We have other places  where the employees are fighting back. You have got the Chicago police  union. God bless them.    Guess what is happening, Mr. Speaker?   The mayor there is trying to put pressure on them.   Guess what, Mr. Speaker? Indiana cities are offering jobs to those  Chicago police officers. If they come here, we are not going to mandate  that.    That is what you are seeing, Mr. Speaker. I just got a  tweet just 20 minutes ago, 30 minutes ago. We are seeing one of our big  companies, one of my big defense contractors in Arizona had an employee  walkout today. They don't want this.   Do you know what, Mr. Speaker? If you want a vaccine, go ahead and  get the vaccine.    But doggone it, it should not be mandated by a tyrannical  government. And this is the tip of the spear on a fascist-style  government, in my opinion.    Amen. People say, looking around, they get so depressed  and frustrated when they see the horrible and horrific impacts of the  policies coming out of this administration, not the least of which is  the curtailing of their freedoms.    The gentleman from Texas talks and reminds us of all of  this, and we are seeing it. Like my friend, I keep a folder in my  computer of story after story of people fighting back saying: No. We  are not going to kowtow; we are not going to bow down to this tyranny.   It gives me hope, and it gives us the optimism to carry on and keep  up the fight because this country was born on freedom, and it is going  to continue. We will see a comeback of freedom.   Like Ronald Reagan said, it may not be in your genes, but you have to  fight it. For every generation it is a new fight to keep freedom, and  this is our fight today.    One of the only good things about the COVID outbreak was  that parents got to see what the kids were learning for a change, and  when they saw it, they said: This is not what I want my kid to learn.  And they started standing up.   Do you know what, Mr. Speaker? It is working.   But do you know what is happening?   Right now, we have got an Attorney General who has basically said: We  are  [[Page H5784]]  going to stop those protests, we are going to stop that communication  that is First Amendment messaging that you give as parents to the  school boards.   That is not the American way. That is the tyranny, and that is the  fascism we are fighting about. That is what you and I were fighting  with the Attorney General today about. And doggone it, we have got to  stand up, and those parents need to be able to stand up, express  themselves, and express their protest.    That is where it is. That is where the fire is starting,  right there at the level of the people.   And if we are going to save this country--I tell people all the  time--it is going to come from the grassroots. It is going to come from  the people. It is going to take off into the local jurisdictions in the  States.   If you think that you are going to save this Nation with the United  States Congress, you are sadly mistaken. It is the States. It is the  individuals. It is the families. It is the people who love this  country, and they are going to keep fighting us back. I am with you 100  percent on that.
