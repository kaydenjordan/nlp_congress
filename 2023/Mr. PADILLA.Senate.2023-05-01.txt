 Madam President, I rise to introduce the Citizenship for  Essential Workers Act.   This legislation would provide a pathway to citizenship for these  workers and their families, who have played a critical role in getting  us through the pandemic and are helping with recovery efforts.   A little over 2 years ago, after I was first sworn into the U.S.  Senate, this was the very first bill I introduced.   Every day, over 5 million essential workers without permanent legal  status kept Americans healthy, fed, and safe during the COVID  pandemic--all while risking their own health and the health of their  families.   They couldn't just Zoom into the office.   Many served us while living in constant fear of deportation.   Back then, for the first time, Americans were waking up to a reality  what families like mine knew for years: that not only were these  immigrant workers saving lives in a time of need but that their work  had always been essential to our country.   As the proud son of immigrants from Mexico whose mother worked as a  housekeeper and father a short order cook--two jobs that today would be  deemed essential--I can only imagine the fear and uncertainty my family  would have experienced every day my dad walked out the door or my mom  set off to enter another family's home in the middle of a pandemic.   The Federal COVID-19 public health emergency comes to an end next  month, but we can't forget the sacrifices these workers made--and still  make every single day--for our country.  [[Page S1443]]    My legislation not only honors their sacrifice but also recognizes  how critical essential workers are to our economy even beyond a public  health emergency.   They have earned their place in this country.                                  ______                                         By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Wyden, and Mr.          Whitehouse):   S. 1395.
