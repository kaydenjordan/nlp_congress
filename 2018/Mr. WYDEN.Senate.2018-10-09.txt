 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, while it is perhaps not in line with  official and genuine Senate protocol, I also want to use this  opportunity to congratulate my good friend in the Chair on the  wonderful events of last weekend for his family.   Mr. President, I have come to the floor to discuss my colleague  Senator  [[Page S6718]]  Baldwin's resolution that would protect the millions of Americans in  Wisconsin and Oregon and all across the land who are faced with  preexisting health conditions.   This has been an area I have focused on since my days as codirector  of the Oregon Gray Panthers because preexisting conditions is kind of  fancy lingo that people talk about as it relates to healthcare policy,  but really what it is all about is, if you have cancer or diabetes or  heart disease or asthma or any one of a score of healthcare conditions,  before the Affordable Care Act, you were just in a world of hurt,  literally and figuratively. In effect, the healthcare system then was  for the healthy and the wealthy. If you were healthy, there was nothing  to worry about--no preexisting condition. If you were wealthy, you just  paid the bills, but if you had preexisting conditions, as millions and  millions of Americans have, then you were really out of luck.    So then, along came the Affordable Care Act. I had written a piece of  legislation, the Healthy Americans Act, with seven Democrats and seven  Republicans as cosponsors. It had airtight, loophole-free protection  for Americans against discrimination if they had preexisting  conditions. That provision from the Healthy Americans Act, to a very  great extent, made its way into the Affordable Care Act. That is why  millions of Americans were able to go to bed at night with a sense of  comfort and a sense that if they did have healthcare conditions, the  insurance companies wouldn't be able to just clobber them with higher  costs. Unfortunately, we have the Trump administration's wanting to  bring back the days when healthcare was for the healthy and wealthy and  allow discrimination against people with preexisting conditions.   The flip side of the preexisting condition coin is junk insurance-- selling junk insurance that really isn't worth a whole lot more than  the paper it is written on. Boy, do I know something about junk  insurance because that is how I started my time in public service, when  senior citizens were sold 15 to 20 policies. Again, the rip-offs were  built in. Back then, if you had one policy and you had another policy  that offered similar coverage, they canceled each other out, and the  senior got nothing. It was junk insurance. If we go back to the days  when they discriminated against people with preexisting conditions, we  are going to have junk insurance all over again.   I am going to begin with the Trump administration's record on this.   First of all, if you are a scam artist who is peddling junk plans,  the Trump administration has your back. If you are a person with a  preexisting condition, the Trump administration is advancing policies  that will make both your health and your wallet in far worse shape.  Now, the Trump officials get up and talk about the benefits of short- term plans. They will use buzz words like ``flexibility'' and  ``patient-centered care,'' but I want everybody to be clear that it is  junk insurance, plain and simple. It is putting a whole lot of lipstick  on a frog.   These junk insurance plans the Trump administration has revived  represent the very worst of industry tricks and abuses. They punish  Americans who really need healthcare. If you are young, if you are  healthy, and if you are wealthy, as I have said, there is nothing to  worry about. With junk plans, you have a glide path to put scams on  those with preexisting conditions like heart disease, cancer, and  mental illness. They exist to prey on older Americans--on women, on the  less fortunate--particularly a group that I have thought was the heart  of where healthcare reform ought to go--to the folks between 55 and 65.   As I have indicated, junk plans are not new. Congress and the  American people have rejected them before. I mentioned my history with  the Oregon Gray Panthers. Big, thick stacks of legalese that nobody  could understand were always hyped to the seniors. They were going to  fill the gaps in Medicare. It was called Medigap. Back then, it was  really just A and B. It didn't have D and Medicare Advantage and all  kinds of other things. It was just A and B.   You had seniors frightened that the gaps in Medicare were going to  consume any savings they might have. So every time a fast-talking  salesperson came through, a senior would buy a policy. When I was the  director of the Gray Panthers, it was common to go to seniors' homes,  and they would actually go to a closet and pull out a shoebox full of  these worthless policies. I really fear we are looking at going back to  those days.   The fact is that Congress finally cracked down on those Medigap rip- offs. I had an opportunity to be a part of that effort as a Member of  the other body, the House, but a lot of people got hurt in the process.   Junk insurance was not just a problem for seniors. A few years ago,  the Affordable Care Act was designed, as I mentioned, in terms of the  Healthy Americans Act, to make sure that junk insurance would be  eliminated across the board. Across the board, we would say in our  country, we are going to have ironclad, loophole-free guarantees that  no American would ever face discrimination over a preexisting  condition.   By the way, that used to be a bipartisan proposition. The fact is  that still serving in this body are a number of my colleagues on the  Republican side who are cosponsors of the Healthy Americans Act, with  that ironclad, loophole-free protection for those with preexisting  conditions. So it is not as if somebody just kind of brought this up as  a partisan issue. It was bipartisan then. Republican Members of this  body, distinguished colleagues, were cosponsors of that Healthy  Americans Act proposition. Now the Trump administration is trying to  turn back the clock. It wants to make junk plans great again--a forced  march back to those days that I described that were only for the  healthy and the wealthy.    The open enrollment plan for health insurance is coming up very  quickly. The Trump administration has cut it in half so that it is  going to last only a few weeks this year. That means, during the  holidays, when Americans are traveling, shopping, and spending time  with family, they will also have to make some judgments about health  insurance. Because of the Trump administration's actions, these junk  insurance policies are going to be peddled at the same time as  insurance that would actually cover, meaningfully, the healthcare that  our people need.   What they are going to be doing with these Trump changes is making  life easy for the scam artists but a nightmare for so many Americans  who, day in and day out, walk an economic tightrope just trying to pay  for essentials. These rip-off artists under the Trump plan are going to  have a green light to steal the money Americans pay in premiums and for  other expenses. According to a recent study, sometimes as much as $2  out of every $3 is wasted on overhead with these administrative costs  and junk insurance profits in these flawed policies that the Trump  administration wants to foist off on Americans.   The disastrous effects of junk insurance aren't limited to those who  get conned into buying it. By bringing junk plans back, the Trump  administration, in effect, goes out and swings a wrecking ball into the  private health insurance markets in our country. It raises costs across  the board, and Americans waste their hard-earned dollars.   Senator Baldwin has a resolution, and I commend my colleague from  Wisconsin on her effort on this. She came and talked with me about this  early on, as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. We  have jurisdiction over something like $1 trillion worth of health  spending. I really appreciate the expertise and the passion that  Senator Baldwin has brought to this issue, and we saw it in her very  first presentation on what she wanted to do. Her resolution is the  Senate's best opportunity to put a stop to the scams that I have  described. It would throw the Trump administration's junk insurance  rules out, and with Senator Baldwin's proposal, it would restore the  protections that millions of Americans count on each day.   The Democrats in the Senate are going to stand up for Americans with  preexisting conditions, and I hope colleagues on the other side will  join us. I recognize that the Trump administration will not, but my  hope is that we will have colleagues on the other side supporting us  for Senator Baldwin's resolution.  [[Page S6719]]    In addition, as if this were not enough of an injury foisted on  vulnerable Americans, the Trump administration has put forward a  nominee for a seat on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals who made  healthcare sabotage one of his top priorities at the Trump Justice  Department. Chad Readler, currently the Deputy Assistant Attorney  General, in my view, is the wrong choice to be a Federal judge.   Earlier this year, the Trump administration decided it just wanted to  get out of the business of enforcing the rules that protect Americans  with preexisting conditions. In fact, it had to argue in court that it  could abandon that essential part of the Affordable Care Act, which was  still the law of the land the last time I looked. Who did the  administration turn to when it needed to cook up a dubious legal  argument that it had no obligation to enforce the law of the land? Chad  Readler. In fact, three career attorneys from the Department of Justice  looked at his argument, and they actually withdrew from the case. Three  career lawyers from the Department of Justice refused to participate.   The Judiciary Committee held a hearing on Mr. Readler's nomination  earlier this month. His nomination could be sent to the floor of the  Senate in the coming weeks, but it ought to be clear that this is a  nominee who is not an impartial individual who has the judicial  temperament Americans expect. He is not somebody who ought to be handed  a seat on the Federal bench and have the power to sign off on the Trump  administration's agenda of healthcare sabotage.   I close with this. The Senate has an opportunity to stand up this  week for the millions of vulnerable Americans who have these  preexisting conditions, for the millions of Americans who under the  Affordable Care Act can go to bed at night knowing that if they have  preexisting conditions, they are not going to lose everything. I am  serious when I talk about losing everything. Once you go back to  discriminating against people with preexisting conditions, you are  going to go back to job lock and all of the problems we saw associated  with discrimination. If you were in Montana or if you were in Oregon  and had a preexisting condition and you got offered a better job on the  other side of town, you couldn't go get it because you would not be  able to get coverage because there was discrimination against people  with preexisting conditions.   This week the Senate is going to have an opportunity to stand up to  the Trump administration and go to bat for the millions and millions of  Americans who are watching this debate who have preexisting conditions  and who are just counting on this body not to turn back the clock and  leave them vulnerable again. Senator Baldwin's resolution would prevent  the Trump administration from bringing back the worst abuses of junk  insurance. If it doesn't pass this week, this will be an issue that, in  my view, will come up again and again and again until it is fixed.   Finally, the Readler nomination, in my view, ought to be stopped in  its tracks. The Senate ought to tell the administration that it is not  going to rubberstamp judicial nominees who have proven, demonstrable  track records of twisting the law in a way that harms the most  vulnerable of our citizens.   I note that the majority leader is here.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
