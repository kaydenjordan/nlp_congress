 Mr. Speaker, our Nation is facing a lot of problems:  historic inflation, sky-high prices at the pump, and a shortage of baby  formula.   But it is important not to lose sight of another crisis going on more  than 1500 miles southwest of where we are gathered right now: 2.6  million illegal immigrants have been apprehended at our southern border  since President Biden took the oath of office.   There were more than 234,000 migrant encounters at the border just in  April. That is the most for any month in history. That is also a 1,268  percent increase from April of 2020.   Border Patrol seized more than 340,000 pounds of drugs since last  October, including enough fentanyl to kill more than 2 billion people.   Yet, this administration is still fighting to repeal title 42. It is  past time to put an end to these open border policies and put the  American people first.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   H.R. 2543 will do nothing to resolve the long list of crises the  Biden administration's policies have caused, such as runaway,  devastating inflation; massive Federal debt; unacceptably high gas  prices; a skyrocketing crime rate; and an open border that allows  millions of illegal immigrants and tons of deadly fentanyl into our  country.   This bill, which has no chance of becoming law and is dead on arrival  in the Senate, would impose additional and burdensome reporting  requirements on public companies, reduce access to credit, distract the  Federal Reserve from pursuing its statutory mandate, and further  politicize our regulatory agencies.   Families in middle Tennessee can't find baby formula and are  struggling to pay for groceries and gas while Democrats are jamming  through a partisan bill just to score political points with their  leftwing progressive base. We must do better for our constituents and  for our country.    So true. Thank you, Vice-Chairman Johnson. I appreciate  that.   Madam Speaker, the average cost of a gallon of gas in this country  just passed $5 per gallon for the very first time. I repeat: The  average cost of a  [[Page H5601]]  gallon of gas in this country just passed $5 per gallon for the very  first time.   I would like to remind Americans, especially those on the other side  of the aisle who may not be affected because they drive electric  vehicles, that prices at the pump started to go up well before Vladimir  Putin's disgraceful invasion of Ukraine.   In fact, they started climbing shortly after President Biden took  office. It is not a coincidence. It is not an unintended consequence.  It was the President's intended outcome.   The President doesn't beat around the bush on the topic of fossil  fuels. On the campaign trail, he pledged to get rid of them. I would  say he is well on his way to keeping that promise.   Remember, this country was a net exporter of oil. Now we are stuck  hoping the President has a good meeting with the Crown Prince of Saudi  Arabia, the same country he called a pariah, one that we hope results  in them producing more oil and, hopefully, lowering global prices.   This administration has taken many steps to make it next to  impossible to expand drilling here at home. We all remember how quickly  the President killed the Keystone XL pipeline with no regard for the  impact that would have on those jobs or how dependent it would make us  on foreign oil suppliers.   This administration has also proposed more than $80 billion in tax  increases on energy producers in the first two budget cycles since  being in office.                                time  1730    We know the war in Ukraine has impacted fuel prices, but we  Republicans argue that we didn't have to be reliant on foreign  countries. If we just used the oil we have here at home, we probably  could have kept prices down. Now, we are asking OPEC to produce more.  It makes no sense.   The President calls this moment an incredible transition. I see  nothing incredible about it. In fact, the only transition I see is the  American people going from being able to provide for their families to  being stuck at home because of record inflation and gas prices that  have more than doubled.   We are not going to go from oil to electric consumption overnight.  The grid isn't ready for an all-electric future. We should pursue an  all-of-the-above approach that includes oil. The Tennessee Valley  Authority uses 39 percent nuclear, 19 percent coal, 26 percent natural  gas, 11 percent hydro, and 3 percent wind and solar to power millions  of homes across the Tennessee valley. That is how you make sure you are  not just energy independent, but you are energy dominant.   The answer isn't raiding our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The answer  certainly isn't relying on foreign countries for supply. The answer is  tapping into the resources with which our Nation happens to be  abundantly blessed.
