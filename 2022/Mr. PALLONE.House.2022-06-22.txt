 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1191, I call  up the bill (H.R. 7666) to amend the Public Health Service Act to  reauthorize certain programs relating to mental health and substance  use disorders, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and add extraneous material on H.R. 7666.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7666, the Restoring Hope  for Mental Health and Well-Being Act of 2022, and I thank Ranking  Member Rodgers for working with me these past few months to develop  this comprehensive legislation that will help address the mental health  and substance use disorder crisis facing millions of Americans.   This bill is needed today more than ever. Americans report rising  anxiety and depression and increased use of alcohol, opiates, and other  substances. One in five adults are battling a mental illness. Suicide  is now the second leading cause of death for children ages 10 to 14,  and earlier this year the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  released a report finding that 4 in 10 high school students said they  felt persistently sad or hopeless during the COVID-19 pandemic. The  opioid crisis also continues to devastate families and communities all  around the Nation. 108,000 people lost their lives due to drug  overdoses just last year alone.   The Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being Act will help  restore hope for millions of Americans. The bill strengthens and  expands more than 30 critical programs that collectively support mental  health care and substance use disorder prevention, care, treatment, and  recovery support services in communities across the Nation.   As the Nation prepares for the launch of the 988 National Suicide  Prevention Lifeline dialing code next month, H.R. 7666 provides key  crisis response efforts, establishing the Substance Abuse and Mental  Health Services Behavioral Health Crisis Coordination Office and  requiring the development of crisis response best practices. The  legislation also continues investments in critical mental health and  substance use services block grant funding to States, territories, and  Tribes.   The Restoring Hope Act includes crucial provisions to meet the  challenges of the Nation's opioid epidemic, expanding and ensuring  timely patient access to lifesaving treatment for opioid use disorders  through the elimination of barriers to treatment. It includes  Representative Tonko's MAT Act, which eliminates the X-waiver, a  burdensome registration requirement that establishes arbitrary caps on  the number of patients a provider can treat for opioid use disorder  using buprenorphine.   This bill also establishes a one-time, 8-hour training requirement on  treating and identifying substance use disorders that providers must  complete  [[Page H5774]]  before their first registration or renewal of a license to dispense  controlled substances.   H.R. 7666 also helps bolster the behavioral health workforce capacity  and training. It also increases access to mental health and substance  use disorder care and coverage by applying the mental health parity law  to State and local government workers, such as teachers and frontline  workers.   The legislation also supports the mental health of children and young  people. It continues investment in the integration of behavioral health  into pediatric primary care through Pediatric Mental Health Access  Grants and enhances research at the National Institutes of Health on  the cognitive, physical, and socioemotional impacts of modern  technology and multimedia on infants, children, and adolescents.   I can't stress enough that this is an epidemic that focuses a lot on  children and adolescents. Older youth need help with suicide prevention  and other mental health support and substance use disorder services.  Students in higher education need that help, and they get it through a  program called the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act.   The bill also ensures that State Medicaid programs have resources to  implement and strengthen school-based mental health services while  preserving the continuity of coverage for justice-involved youth. These  important provisions will increase children's access to care.   Mr. Speaker, the scope and reach of this bipartisan legislation--and  I stress that. This was reported out of the Energy and Commerce  Committee unanimously, Mr. Speaker. It is truly bipartisan. It is going  to help to support the mental health and well-being of millions of  Americans, their families, and communities for years to come.   I thank Members on both sides of the aisle, not only Ranking Member  Rodgers, but the subcommittee leadership as well, both Democrat and  Republican.   The reason that we try to do this on a bipartisan level and get  everybody's support is because we have a good chance of passing this in  the Senate, which is also acting on similar legislation. We are hopeful  that as a result of a large vote today, that will spur the Senate into  action, and we can actually get this bill signed into law.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                      Washington, DC, June 10, 2022.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: This letter is to advise you that       the Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 7666, the ``Restoring Hope for       Mental Health and Well-Being Act of 2022,'' that fall within       our Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting with us       on those provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no objection       to your including them in the bill for consideration on the       House floor, and to expedite that consideration is willing to       forgo action on H.R. 7666, with the understanding that we do       not thereby waive any future jurisdictional claim over those       provisions or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                      Washington, DC, June 13, 2022.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Energy and Commerce and agreeing to be       discharged from further consideration of H.R. 7666, the       ``Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being Act of       2022,'' so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the       House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will ensure our letters on H.R. 7666 are included in the       report for this bill and entered into the Congressional       Record during floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate       your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward       to continuing to work together as this measure moves through       the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,                                                          Chairman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), who chairs our Subcommittee on Consumer  Protection and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), who has been involved with these health and  behavioral issues for a long time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Tonko), who chairs our Environment and Climate Change  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. O'Halleran), a member of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster), a member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the House majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  [[Page H5778]]  Washington (Ms. Schrier), a member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Mrs. Fletcher), who is also a member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I just wanted to stress that H.R. 7666  includes programs focused on supporting youth mental health.    I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership on this  issue. In fact, H.R. 7666 includes programs focused on supporting youth  mental health including due to such traumatic events that were  mentioned by the gentlewoman.   The SAMHSA Garrett Lee Smith State/Tribal Youth Suicide Prevention  and Early Intervention Program, for instance, and HRSA's Pediatric  Mental Health Care Access program, which helps integrate behavioral  health into pediatric primary care, extends resources to support  Project AWARE, building student, families, and school behavioral health  resiliency. Further, the bill provides support to complement SAMHSA's  launch of the new 988 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline dialing code  next month that will expand access to crisis care support through call,  text, or chat functions for millions of Americans.   Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Let me just add, I am pleased to work with the  gentlewoman from Texas on this critical matter.   I thank her for her support in ensuring children and families have  access to the mental health support and services they need to lead  healthy and hopeful lives.   Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman  from Texas.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Levin).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Let me just reiterate what the ranking member said. This was really a  bipartisan bill. I thank Mrs. Rodgers, Mr. Guthrie, Ms. Anna Eshoo, and  all the staff that worked so hard on this legislation.   It is important that we have as big a vote as possible because this  bill has a real chance of passing the Senate and getting to the  President's desk and will really address the mental health and  substance abuse concerns that we have and the crisis that we have. So I  urge everyone to vote ``yes.''   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution No. 1191, I  rise to offer amendments en bloc No. 1.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the eight mental health  amendments under this en bloc consideration. Collectively, these  amendments further strengthen the bipartisan nature of the underlying  comprehensive bill, the Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being  Act of 2022.   I thank my colleagues for their leadership and contributions to  furthering the health of the American people and wish to speak in  strong support of their adoption into H.R. 7666.   Many of these amendments, Madam Speaker, include provisions from  bills that previously passed the House this Congress on suspension that  the Senate has yet to act upon.   I am pleased that we have the opportunity to, once again, emphasize  their importance by including them in this crucial legislative package.   The amendment offered by Congressman Bera and Congressman Fitzpatrick  is just such an amendment. Like the bill it reflects, the HERO Act,  which passed the House last year, it will improve data collection and  services to ensure our first responders and public safety officers  receive the mental health care services they need.   Additionally, Congresswoman Napolitano and Congressman Katko  submitted an amendment which extends and revises SAMHSA's Project AWARE  program providing school-based mental health services, including  screening, treatment, and outreach programs, provisions that likewise  passed the House last year in H.R. 721, the Mental Health Services for  Students Act of 2021.   Representatives Katko and Napolitano were also joined by Congressmen  Beyer, Raskin, Cardenas, and Fitzpatrick in offering an additional  amendment that includes provisions from H.R. 2981, the Suicide  Prevention Lifeline Improvement Act of 2021, which also passed the  House last year.   The amendment extends funding for SAMHSA's Lifeline--crucial in this  Nation's moment of mental health crisis, supporting crisis care  response and support as we prepare for the launch of the new 988  dialing code next month.   I appreciate the additional focus on the particular needs of certain  communities in our country that several amendments add to the  underlying bill.   I thank Representatives Reschenthaler, Morelle, Wild, and Dean for  their amendment requiring a study to determine the true cost of  untreated serious mental illness on families, healthcare systems,  public housing, and law enforcement in America.   In addition, we certainly cannot do enough to support the men and  women who have valiantly served our Nation in the Armed Forces.   I thank Congressman Joyce for his amendment that requires the  Department of Defense to carry out a 2-year pilot program aimed at  preventing suicides amongst Active-Duty members of the Armed Forces.   I also appreciate and support the amendment submitted by Congressman  Feenstra requiring the new Behavioral Health Crisis Coordinating Office  established within SAMHSA by H.R. 7666, to provide technical assistance  and support to the Veterans Crisis Line.   Further, Madam Speaker, I support the mental health and well-being of  those who are pregnant or postpartum. The amendment offered by  Congresswoman Moore makes important improvements to the Maternal Mental  Health Hotline authorization to ensure those implementing the hotline  consult with appropriate State, local, and Tribal public officials and  those working with low-income people.   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 7666 would establish a new  authorization for a Maternal Mental Health Hotline, and I appreciate  Representative Moore's amendment that will serve to improve the  underlying legislation.   Finally, Madam Speaker, while we know children in this country are  facing a mental health crisis, unfortunately, we know that all too many  also experience other chronic health challenges.   I am grateful to Representative Pressley for her amendment requiring  the Secretary of Health and Human Services conduct a study on the rates  and risks of suicidal behaviors among youth with chronic illnesses and  to provide Congress with recommendations for ways to provide early  intervention, best practices, and strategies to address disparities.   I am pleased to support these amendments and encourage my colleagues  to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley), who has one of the important amendments  included in this en bloc.    Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1191, I rise  to offer amendments en bloc No. 2.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this en bloc amendment. This  package includes bipartisan bills and policies that will increase  access to substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery  support services.   The amendment introduced by Representatives Rodney Davis, Bilirakis,  O'Halleran, Wagner, and Kuster reflects H.R. 2355, the Opioid  Prescription Verification Act of 2021, which has previously passed the  House. The amendment, like the bill it is drawn from, encourages the  use of e-prescribing for opioids and incentivizes States to maintain  and utilize prescription drug monitoring programs.   Likewise, the amendment offered by Representatives Andy Kim and  Davids also reflects a previously House-passed bill, H.R. 2364, the  Synthetic Opioid Danger Awareness Act. Their amendment requires the  Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a public education  campaign about synthetic opioids, including fentanyl and its analogues,  and disseminate information about synthetic opioids to healthcare  providers.   Continuing the theme of bipartisanship, Representatives McKinley and  Dingell introduced an amendment that amends the Controlled Substances  Act to clarify the process for registrants to exercise due diligence  upon discovering a suspicious order. Like the prior amendments, this,  too, is drawn from a prior House-passed bill, H.R. 768, the Block,  Report, And Suspend Suspicious Shipments Act of 2021.   Further, the amendment offered by Representatives Trone, Armstrong,  and Sherrill also draws from a prior House-passed bill extending a  critical authorization for the State Opioid Response grants and Tribal  Opioid Response grants for 5 years.   Another amendment introduced by Representatives Dean, Spartz,  Scanlon, and Fitzpatrick reflects H.R. 5950, the Improving Patient  Access to Care and Treatment Act. This amendment increases the time  from 14 to 60 days that healthcare providers can hold long-acting  injectable buprenorphine before administering it to a patient, giving  patients and practitioners greater flexibility when accessing opioid  use disorder treatment.   Finally, this amendment package includes an amendment offered by  Representative Gottheimer that would ensure that veterans are included  within the crisis response continuum of best practices included in H.R.  7666.   I thank the sponsors of these provisions. These bipartisan amendments  provide strong tools to address the ongoing overdose crisis and will  save lives. I urge my colleagues to support this package of amendments  and include them in the overall bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, but I do not oppose the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this amendment. Like the bill  that passed the House last year, H.R. 2877, and other House-passed  provisions we hope to include through amendment into the Restoring Hope  Act, this bipartisan amendment is part of the bipartisan approach  Ranking Member Rodgers and I have taken since day one with this  critical bill.   This amendment requires the Secretary to consult with a range of  experts, including mental health and education professionals, to  develop best practices for schools and universities to establish  behavioral intervention teams to identify concerning behaviors and  manage risks among students. The guidance must determine how these  teams can operate effectively while relying on evidence-based,  objective protection of the constitutional and civil rights of students  and staff.   Madam Speaker, I understand that some disability and civil rights  organizations have concerns about the provisions of this amendment and  opposed the original bill. I agree that we must be sensitive to the  concerns of these organizations and not inadvertently perpetuate a  false association of psychiatric disability and gun violence, nor  promote the preemptive use of law enforcement to address problematic  student behaviors, particularly among students with disabilities and/or  students of color, who are already disproportionately excessively  disciplined compared to their peers.   At the same time, I think there is merit to the idea of teams of  behavioral health specialists working in concert with educators to  identify youth and college students who may be at risk of harming  themselves or others and making sure they get the support they need.   This bill has passed the full House twice, as I said, on suspension,  both this Congress and last Congress. My understanding is that the  bill's sponsors have made changes when reintroducing the bill this  Congress to address some of the stakeholders' concerns by including  more robust privacy protections and inappropriate referral protections.  I think these changes improve the bill.   I understand the stakeholders would like to see additional changes,  and as I have indicated in the past, I am committed to examining ways  to address these concerns and add additional guardrails as the bill  progresses through negotiations with our Senate counterparts, including  this amendment for consideration for adoption into H.R. 7666, but we  need to pass the amendment to allow those kinds of negotiations with  the Senate.   I look forward to working closely with stakeholders, Congressman  Ferguson, and the other original leads of H.R. 2877, and, of course,  our ranking member, to strike the right balance that protects the  health, privacy, and rights of all students.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for expressing his  concerns relating to the MAT Act, but I respectfully disagree with his  proposal.   First of all, I take issue with some of his characterizations  regarding buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is not broadly available to all  Americans who need it. In fact, only 1 in 10 individuals with opioid  use disorder receive medications for their condition, including  buprenorphine.   Over half of all rural counties in the United States do not have a  single waivered buprenorphine provider, and 40 percent of all counties  in the United States don't have a single waivered provider, according  to the HHS-OIG.   This is a huge treatment gap. A treatment gap for opioid use  disorders means lives are lost every day unnecessarily when there is  treatment available. This is tragic and not acceptable.   Second, the gentleman has made the argument that buprenorphine is not  effective against fentanyl, but that is not accurate. Buprenorphine is  proven to reduce fentanyl use and overdose deaths, according to the  National Academies of Sciences Consensus Report on Medications for  Opioid Use Disorders and the United States Commission on Combating  Synthetic Opioid Trafficking.   Delaying the elimination of the X waiver to 2024 means extending the  time in which a barrier to treatment is in place, leading to an  increased risk of overdose and death.   It is clear that we are experiencing record numbers of overdose  deaths in America. This is a public health emergency and needs to be  addressed immediately.   Buprenorphine is a proven, evidence-based treatment for opioid use  disorder. Buprenorphine prevents painful withdrawal symptoms, reduces  opioid cravings, and cuts the risk of overdose in half. This is due to  buprenorphine's ceiling effect, which makes it nearly impossible to  overdose on the medication. For these reasons, it is considered safer  than commonly prescribed medications like insulin and blood thinners.   Madam Speaker, eliminating the X waiver is a cornerstone of the  Restoring Hope Act. The MAT Act amendment to this package was adopted  at markup by a vote of 45-10. It received support from the majority of  Republicans and Democrats on the committee.    Further, nothing in this bill limits the ability of States to prepare  and act on the overdose crisis.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.   To the contrary, this legislation empowers States to determine the  appropriate training, licensing requirements, and tools for providers  who dispense controlled substances and treat patients with substance  use disorders. All the MAT Act does is remove an unnecessary and  outdated Federal barrier to States effectively addressing the opioid  overdose crisis.   If we don't act now, we risk tens of thousands of additional  overdoses and unnecessary loss of life. I urge my colleagues to reject  this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1191, I call  up the bill (H.R. 5585) to establish the Advanced Research Projects  Agency-Health, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        June 22, 2022, on page H5795, in the second column, the  following appeared:  Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House  Resolution 1191, I call up the bill (H.R. 5595) to establish the  Advanced Research Projects Agency-Health, and for other purposes,  and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.      The online version has been corrected to read:  Mr.  Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1191, I call up the bill  (H.R. 5585) to establish the Advanced Research Projects Agency- Health, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on H.R. 5585.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 5585, the Advance  Research Projects Agency-Health Act, or ARPA-H Act.   In February, the Energy and Commerce Committee's Health Subcommittee  held a hearing to discuss the Biden administration's proposal to  establish the Advance Research Projects Agency for Health, better known  as ARPA-H.   The agency is modeled after the Defense Advanced Research Projects  Agency, or DARPA. The mission of ARPA-H is to translate fundamental  biomedical research into breakthrough platform technologies that would  change healthcare as we know it.   ARPA-H would focus on the highest-risk, highest-reward issues in  disease research. It will attempt to solve the problems that the  private and public sectors have not been able to conquer. The  expectations we have for this agency are justifiably high.   Our hope is that within 5 years of operations, ARPA-H will have led  to the development of cutting-edge treatments and cures for cancer,  diabetes, autoimmune disorders, and mental health conditions.   In order to be truly successful, we must ensure that all Americans  have access to these innovations. Equity and promoting the health of  all Americans must also be part of ARPA-H's mission.   The fiscal year 2022 omnibus appropriations law provided the  Department of Health and Human Services with $1 billion to get ARPA-H  off the ground. We must now provide the necessary and appropriate  authorities to make ARPA-H successful, to clarify its mission and its  organizational structure,  [[Page H5799]]  and ensure that the work at ARPA-H is not duplicative or redundant.  H.R. 5585 does just that.   ARPA-H will be led by a director and cadre of program managers with  the autonomy and authority to develop high-risk, high-reward  portfolios. This will be coupled with the appropriate contracting,  hiring, and procurement authorities that will pull from the best minds  and resources in the biomedical research ecosystem.   This legislation authorizes $500 million annually for 5 fiscal years.  ARPA-H projects will be time- and milestone-limited, ensuring that each  project delivers real and measurable results. The ARPA-H Act includes  reporting requirements to ensure proper compliance and avoid the  redundancy. The director will be required to submit reports on the  actions, results, and forthcoming strategic plans of ARPA-H to Congress  so that we can confirm that the agency is meeting our intent.   So last month, the Committee on Energy and Commerce advanced H.R.  5585 by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 55-3. This was a tremendous  achievement and demonstrates Congress' ability to come together and  find solutions that will improve the health of all Americans.   I thank Health Subcommittee Chairwoman Eshoo, who is the author of  this legislation, along with Health Subcommittee Ranking Member  Guthrie, our full committee Ranking Member Rodgers, and also  Representatives DeGette and Upton for their work on this important  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5585, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Eshoo), the Health Subcommittee chair and the author of  this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Colorado (Ms. DeGette), the chair of our Energy and Commerce Oversight  and Investigations Subcommittee who has also worked on ARPA-H in the  very beginning.    Mr. Speaker, I must say that for many years we had a  Congressman Brown on the committee who contributed a lot, particularly  on healthcare issues. He chaired the Health Subcommittee. So it is an  honor to hear from Ms. Brown of Ohio. We have another Congresswoman  Brown from Ohio.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms.  Brown).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Auchincloss), who is also very much involved in  healthcare issues with regard to the pharmaceutical industry and so  many other health issues.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to say in closing that I think you can feel  the real enthusiasm and the hope that is involved with both the  sponsors of this bill and those who spoke on both sides of the aisle.   We consider ourselves, the Energy and Commerce Committee, the  innovation committee, and I think this is a prime example of the type  of innovation that we see for the future and the hope in ARPA-H.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask for everyone on a bipartisan basis to vote  for this, so we have a strong vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that in the  engrossment of H.R. 7666, the Clerk be authorized to correct section  numbers, punctuation, spelling, and cross-references and to make such  other technical and conforming changes as may be necessary to reflect  the actions of the House.
