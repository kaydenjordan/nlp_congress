 Madam Speaker, suspending Russia's normal trade  relation status with the United States is the right and absolutely  necessary thing to do.   I have to note, Madam Speaker, that our President continues to take  an incremental and piecemeal response to Vladimir Putin and this  unprovoked attack on Ukraine. It is wholly inadequate. Not only will it  not deter this tyrant, I fear it will embolden other adversaries to  follow suit.   Madam Speaker, we have to stop assaulting oil and gas. This has to be  an early warning to the United States and lawmakers.   We can steward the environment. We should. But we have to understand  the geopolitical importance of energy independence. We can do both.  This is America.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues, all of my colleagues,  Republicans and Democrats, to support this suspension. But I urge my  President: Be more resolute. Act with a sense of urgency. Provide the  war machines and weaponry that the Ukrainians need to fight for their  freedom and independence.   God bless America.
