 Madam President, first of all, this is an important step  that we are taking here. This is a matter that we have been discussing  for a long time. There has been a lot of action on it, and I want to  thank Senator Rubio and Senator Cardin, who are the lead supporters of  this bill and who have, on behalf of the committee, done yeoman's work  getting it together and getting the bipartisan compromise to get the  language here. Also, virtually all members of the committee have had  fingerprints on this bill, and so in that regard, I think it is going  to pass quite handily.   I want to thank the Banking staff, particularly my colleague from  Idaho, Senator Crapo, who, of course, has the expertise--the Banking,  Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee--on these kinds of things on  sanctions. They were very helpful in hammering out the language that we  needed for the sanctions.   I want to thank the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee  staff, who were helpful.   I want to thank the staff of the Foreign Relations Committee, who  work for us--both the minority staff, Senator Menendez's staff, and my  staff, the majority staff--for doing this and all of the people who  worked on this. So thank you to all of you.   Since June, millions of people in Hong Kong have taken to the streets  protesting the erosion of their rights and freedoms.   Hong Kong was supposed to maintain a high degree of autonomy after  China regained sovereignty over the territory in 1997. This wasn't just  a verbal understanding. This was in the treaty that China signed with  Great Britain. However, since that time, China has gradually chipped  away at Hong Kong's autonomy, and this is now becoming a real problem.   China now refers to its treaty with Great Britain as ``a historical  document,'' and says it is no longer bound by its terms. This is just  one of many examples that show that the Chinese Government has no  respect for the rule of law.   After two decades of broken commitments, it is past time that we hold  the Chinese Communist Party accountable. What it is doing in Hong Kong  is just wrong.   That is why I am proud to join Senator Rubio and Senator Cardin and  all the others who have had hands on this bill in bringing the Hong  Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act to the Senate floor. This bill is  the result of a strong, strong bipartisan consensus that we must act in  support of the Hong Kong people.   Thank you all for helping. We will get to the unanimous consent here  in a little bit.   I yield the floor to Senator Cardin.    Madam President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  However, in honor of Veterans Day on November 11, this month I will  honor a veteran-owned small business for each of the 10 days the Senate  is in legislative session. The personal sacrifices made by America's  veterans have protected the very freedoms and values that give each of  us and our children the ability to achieve the American dream. The  skills veterans learn as members of the military are invaluable and  undoubtedly contribute to Idaho's flourishing veteran business  community. I am proud of the sacrifices veterans have made to protect  our country and that they are choosing Idaho to call home when they  complete their service in the military.   As your U.S. Senator from the great State of Idaho, it is my pleasure  to recognize Hammer Down River Excursions in White Bird as the veteran- owned Idaho Small Business of the Day for November 19, 2019.   Hammer Down River Excursions is owned and operated by U.S. Army  veteran Homer Brown. The business offers guided tours, dinner cruises,  and fishing expeditions to showcase Idaho's rich, natural beauty in the  heart of Hells Canyon and the Salmon River. Professional, experienced  guides teach guests how to fish Idaho's steelhead, trout, bass, and  salmon.   Brown spent his youth fishing and working along the Salmon River  before entering the Army. After completing his time of service, Brown  got his captain's license so he could return to the Salmon River to  work as a jet boat captain. Brown takes pride in sharing Idaho's beauty  with his patrons.   Congratulations to Homer Brown and all of the employees at Hammer  Down River Excursions for being selected as the Veteran-owned Idaho  Small Business of the Day for November 19, 2019. You make our great  State proud, and I look forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
