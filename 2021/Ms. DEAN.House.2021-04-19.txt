 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me.  I also thank the ranking member and the committee in its entirety for  working on this bill together. It is a sign of bipartisanship, one that  I can be proud of and we can all be proud of.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1491, the Fair Debt  Collection Practices for Servicemembers Act.   Every day, we are reminded of the significant sacrifices our troops  make to protect us. As Members of Congress, I believe we have a  responsibility to protect those who protect us.   The Fair Debt Collection Practices for Servicemembers Act works to  live up to this responsibility by addressing abusive debt collection  practices specifically targeting servicemembers.   According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, approximately  40 percent of complaints filed by servicemembers concern debt  collection, as compared to only 26 percent by nonservicemembers. These  debt collection practices are manipulative and have negative career  implications for soldiers, like contacting their superior officers or  threatening them with rank reductions.   Unfortunately, these practices do not stop with the servicemembers.  Debt collectors also target military spouses, unfairly burdening our  military families who have sacrificed so much.   These tactics are egregious and must stop. Our servicemen and -women  make extraordinary sacrifices on our behalf. The last thing they need  is harassment from debt collectors who take advantage of their service,  which is why I am pleased to rise in support of the bill today.                                time  1545    Specifically, my bill amends the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act  and prohibits a debt collector from communicating with a  servicemember's chain of command or a dependent for the purpose of  threatening to have their rank reduced or threatening to revoke their  security clearance.   This legislation will help ensure that our military families are not  unnecessarily targeted and shield them from bad practices from debt  collectors. We recognize our servicemembers' spirit of service, and we  must do our part to be of service to them.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members, as they did last Congress, to  support the Fair Debt Collection Practices for Servicemembers Act.
