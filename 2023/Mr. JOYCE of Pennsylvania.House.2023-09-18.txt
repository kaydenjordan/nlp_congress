 Mr. Speaker, since President Biden took  office, there have been over 5.8 million illegal crossings on our  southern border and 1.6 million illegal immigrants have evaded  apprehension.   Instead of funding our Border Patrol agents to deal with the rise in  attempted crossings, President Biden has chosen to incentivize  crossings by ending President Trump's remain in Mexico policy.   At a time when the leading cause of death for Americans between the  ages of 18 and 45 is overdoses, Democrats' failure to pass  comprehensive border security legislation is an indictment of their  failure to protect the American people. Instead of addressing the  importation of fentanyl-related substances, liberals in this body have  voted against legislation like the HALT Fentanyl Act, which is  legislation that would permanently classify these drugs as schedule I  narcotics and impose harsh penalties on the dealers who traffic these  deadly poisons.   In the past year, I have spoken with too many first responders who  have administered Narcan on 911 calls. I have spoken with too many  county coroners conducting autopsies on young people killed far too  soon by fentanyl poisonings. I have spoken with far too many families  who have lost a loved one to an overdose.   It is time for the Senate to stop sitting on the sidelines while  Americans suffer and die. It is time to pass the HALT Fentanyl Act. It  is time to secure our border.   Our top priority must be to protect our Nation's border and put a  stop to drug smuggling and illegal immigration that have made every  State in our Union a border State.                            ____________________
