 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material in consideration of H.J. Res.  123.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 647, I  call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 123) making further continuing  appropriations for fiscal year 2018, and for other purposes, and ask  for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today to present H.J. Res. 123, a continuing resolution that  maintains funding for Federal Government operations and prevents a  shutdown.   Current funding legislation expires tomorrow, Friday, December 8.  Congress must act now to prevent a government shutdown and preserve  vital Federal programs that Americans rely on. This action is critical  to our Nation's stability, our national security, our economic health,  and the well-being of the American people.   This simple, clean extension of funding provides fiscal year 2018  funding for government programs through December 22, an additional 2  weeks, and will allow time for leadership to reach a deal on overall  topline spending levels for the 2018 fiscal year.                                time  1430    I would note that the executive branch supports adoption of this  continuing resolution. Yesterday's Statement of Administration Policy  says: ``This legislation funds the Federal Government at current  spending levels without unnecessary extraneous provisions.''   It concludes that his advisers would recommend that the President  sign the bill into law.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the December 6 Statement of  Administration Policy regarding H.J. Res. 123.                     Statement of Administration Policy      h.j. res. 123--further continuing appropriations act, 2018--rep.                            frelinghuysen, r-nj         The Administration supports House passage of H.J. Res. 123,       the Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018.        This legislation funds the Federal Government at current       spending levels without unnecessary extraneous provisions       through December 22, 2017, while the Congress continues to       work on a longer-term funding agreement. The legislation also       includes language to ensure that States and Territories have       adequate funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program       (CHIP) through December.        The Administration believes that funding for national       security, including for our military, to secure the Southern       Border, and to enhance missile defense capabilities, must be       prioritized in a long-term funding agreement, and will       continue working with the Congress to achieve that goal.        If H.J. Res. 123 was presented to the President in its       current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the       bill into law.     Mr. Speaker, the House has completed our  appropriations work over 80 days ago, passing all 12 bills before the  end of the last fiscal year for the first time in nearly a decade. This  included critical, important funding for national defense and other  important matters.   Unfortunately, the Appropriations Committee cannot proceed without an  agreement with the Senate on overall funding levels. The reality is  that we are running into a deadline this week, and this resolution is  our best and only option at this time.   Once a broader budget agreement has been reached, which I hope will  be soon, the committee will continue its work to complete final  negotiations with the Senate on all 12 of the regular appropriations  bills that will fully fund the Federal Government through September of  next year.  [[Page H9733]]    Our committee is also moving quickly to act on a third emergency  supplemental funding bill to help our communities across the Nation  recover from recent major disasters.   In the meantime, Congress must do its job and pass the continuing  resolution and then another one into the new year to keep the  government open and ensure that all important Federal services are  available to all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this necessary and responsible  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), my colleague, and the distinguished  chairman of the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs  Subcommittee.

Let's keep the Federal Government open for business to serve our  constituents across the Nation.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
