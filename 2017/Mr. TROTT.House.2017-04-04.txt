 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1343, the  Encouraging Employee Ownership Act.   I want to thank my colleagues, Mr. Hultgren and Mr. Delaney, for  their thoughtful and bipartisan work on this issue.   This is a commonsense, simple bill that makes it easier for employees  to obtain ownership in the companies  [[Page H2674]]  they work for. When I was in the private sector, I gave dozens of  employees an ownership interest. It worked out great for them, it  worked out great for the company, and it worked out great for our  customers. Ownership interest gave them an upside that could not be  realized through a salary. The stock instilled loyalty and dedication.  More importantly, it created a family atmosphere. We were all in it  together. Our opportunities would rise and fall, depending on our  collective success.   To have a career where someday, through your hard work, you can end  up owning a piece of action is what the American Dream is all about.  The outdated cap is keeping this dream, for no good reason, from many  Americans.   I suspect that those who oppose the bill, while they may understand  the legislation, probably have never worked in the private sector and  have no clue how meaningful incentives and opportunities, such as stock  ownership, are to individuals. I found it was the best way to motivate  and reward employees. In fact, it worked so well, no one ever left the  company except to retire.   My friends from Michigan and Minnesota oppose the bill because of a  lack of transparency. The argument is flawed because it assumes stock  ownership opportunities comprise all or a significant portion of the  individual's compensation. This is not correct. A stock ownership  benefit is typically over and above salary and bonuses.   To require the owner of a small business or a startup to make  disclosures will cause many employers not to give employees this  opportunity. Implicit in their argument is an assumption, like in so  many other areas of life, that individuals cannot be trusted to make  decisions on their own, that they need the help of all of the smart  politicians and bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., to tell them what to  do and what they need to see, and, of course, we cannot trust people to  make decisions and discern for themselves whether stock ownership is a  fair opportunity.   This bill had the support of a bipartisan group in our committee. I  urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 1343.                                time  1600
