 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, to the chairman and to the Republican  team, let me offer, on behalf of the Democrats and Mr. Conyers, our  deepest sympathy for the loss of Burak, and to also acknowledge how  important our staff is and how important we are as a family on the  Judiciary Committee; staff, Republican and Democratic staff members,  working together around legislation that makes a difference in the  lives of Americans. To hear the dedication of Burak only warms our  hearts to recognize that we still live in the greatest country in the  world because we have young people willing to serve and sacrifice on  behalf of their Nation. I offer my deepest sympathy to you and to his  family as well.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the underlying bill, and that is H.R.  1039. Again, as we finish Police Week, let me say to all of those in  law enforcement, including our Federal law enforcement, local, county,  and State, a very large ``thank you'' for the work that you have done.   In my work as a former judge in the city of Houston, I have seen  their work up close and personal, and as well, I have had the  opportunity, on a number of cases, where I have asked and interacted  with them as they have proceeded with their investigation to find the  culprit, the perpetrator, and to make the community safe.   Federal probation officers perform a critical service in interacting  with and managing their supervisees. They have a central role in  seeking to achieve the important goals of supervision, which includes  rehabilitating the defendant, safeguarding society from further  criminal conduct by the defendant, and protecting the rights of  victims.   Although probation officers do have the ability to arrest a  supervisee under certain circumscribed conditions, they should not take  on the role of police officers. Rather, they should focus on their role  of working in a constructive manner with supervisees to maximize the  chances of adherence to the conditions of supervision.   We certainly do not want probation officers to be threatened or  assaulted while performing their duties, nor do we want anyone to  obstruct the performance of those duties. In many instances, those  probation officers can be assisted by backup officers or other Federal  officers in the line of their duty. That is why Congress enacted  section 111 of title 18 of the United States Code which prohibits such  behavior. If violated, these crimes should be investigated, charges  brought when appropriate, but also the probation officer can seek  assistance.   In fact, probation officers have long relied on law enforcement  officers to provide support during searches, and I believe that is  still the best course. Section 111, however, itself presents serious  issues about the vagueness of some of its terms that define violation,  such as ``interferes'' or ``opposes.''   May I remind my colleagues that we have a First Amendment. We have  the right of freedom of speech and freedom of access, freedom of  movement. This exacerbates my concerns about allowing probation  officers to arrest individuals whom they are not supervising for  violations of this section.   Indeed, we are told by proponents of the bill that Federal probation  officers plan to use lesser-included authority to detain violators  instead of bringing them in for charges after an arrest. At a time when  we need to do more to de-escalate circumstances involving  confrontations between law enforcement and citizens, I am concerned  that establishing this authority would only lead to more confrontation.   In concluding, as I indicated, the bill would authorize Federal  probation officers to arrest, without a warrant, an individual other  than their supervisee if there is probable cause to believe that person  assaulted or interfered with a probation officer in the course of their  duties.   I believe there are conflicting constitutional issues here, and I ask  my colleagues, with all due respect, to oppose the legislation.  [[Page H4364]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1039, the  ``Probation Officer Protection Act.''   I must oppose this bill for several important reasons.   To begin with, this bill raises serious constitutional and practical  concerns that could have been identified and explored had our Committee  held any hearings on the subject matter.   This bill would authorize federal probation officers to arrest  without a warrant an individual--other than supervisees--if there is  probable cause to believe that person assaulted or interfered with a  probation officer in the course of their duties.   The changes this bill would make to current law would significantly  alter the role of federal probation officers and invite abuse in the  application of the proposed expanded authority.   Federal probation officers perform a critical service in interacting  with and managing their supervisees. They have a central role in  seeking to achieve the important goals of supervision, which includes:   (1) rehabilitating the defendant;   (2) safeguarding society from further criminal conduct by the  defendant; and   (3) protecting the rights of victims.   Although probation officers do have the ability to arrest a  supervisee under certain circumscribed conditions, they should not take  on the role of police officers. Rather, they should focus on their role  of working in a constructive manner with supervisees to maximize the  chances of adherence to the conditions of supervision.   We certainly do not want probation officers to be threatened or  assaulted while performing their duties, nor do we want anyone to  obstruct the performance of those duties.   That is why Congress enacted Section 111 of Title 18 of the United  States Code, which prohibits such behavior. If violated, these crimes  should be investigated and charges brought when appropriate.   In fact, probation officers have long relied on law enforcement  officers to provide support during searches, and I believe that is  still the best course to continue.   Section 111, however, itself presents serious issues about the  vagueness of some of its terms that define violations, such as  ``interferes'' or ``opposes''.   This exacerbates my concerns about allowing probation officers to  arrest individuals whom they are not supervising for violations of this  section.   Making such determinations on vague terms invites abuse.   Indeed, we are told by proponents of the bill that federal probation  officers plan to use ``lesser included'' authority to ``detain''  violators instead of bringing them in for charges after an arrest.   This is an invitation for abuse as it indicates the statute may be  used--at times--when not necessary.   And, at a time when we need to do more to de-escalate circumstances  involving confrontations between law enforcement and citizens, I am  concerned that establishing this authority will only lead to more  confrontation.   This is all the more troubling because of constitutional concerns  regarding such detentions. As the Federal Public Defenders of New York  explains: ``the Fourth Amendment does not permit probation officers to  exercise this `lesser included' power. Under an exception to the Fourth  Amendment's probable cause requirement, police officers, when executing  a search warrant, are permitted to temporarily restrain third parties  absent probable cause for arrest, including by using handcuffs. In  holding such detentions to be `reasonable,' the Supreme Court  emphasized the fact--`of prime importance'--that the search was  authorized by a neutral magistrate's finding of probable cause to  search the premises.''   In the circumstances contemplated by this bill, the probation  officers would have the right to be on the premises, but their  underlying authority to detain individuals--not based on a probable  cause warrant--would fail this constitutional requirement.   Overall, the extension of third-party arrest authority to federal  probation officers is a step in the wrong direction. As the Federal  Defenders warn, the ``bill represents a retreat from the current  constructive role of probation officers in reintegrating offenders into  society. If probation officers assumed the role of police, directing  and restraining, or arresting, family and friends, progress in  individual cases and the system as a whole would be undermined.''   Likewise, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Leadership  Counsel for Civil and Human Rights have expressed strong opposition to  this bill.   I appreciate the dedication of federal probation officers in carrying  out their important duties. And it is because of my respect for the  role that they play that I fear that this bill will ultimately serve to  undermine it.   Accordingly, I ask that my colleagues join me in opposing this well- intentioned, but harmful bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman and indicate  that there is no doubt we want our officers to be safe.   I do want to bring to the attention of my colleagues that we don't  want probation officers to be threatened or assaulted while performing  their work or their duties, nor do we want to obstruct the performance  of those duties.   Let me remind my colleagues that many times probation officers are  going into homes. There are moms and grandmoms or granddads or  children, and certainly we realize that emotions of concern may occur.   We want our probation officers to be safe. That is why Congress  enacted section 111 of title 18 of the United States Code which  prohibits such behavior. And if violated, these crimes should be  investigated, and charges are brought.   But the other point is that our probation officers undergo an initial  6 weeks of training and some additional training during the year. They  still do not have the degree of training of law enforcement officers. I  want them to be protected. That is why I think it is important that  they have the assistance of trained law enforcement officers.   Not all probation officers carry a firearm, as it varies in each  judicial district. We want them protected, and we would rather follow  the law, which is section 111.   Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 5 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), who has a  longstanding record of advocacy and support for the Nation's law  enforcement and first responders, and he is a member of the Ways and  Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire if the other side has any  additional speakers?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume to close.   First of all, let me indicate the important work that all law  enforcement do and, as well, those who serve in the probation  departments of our State and Federal Government. In particular, we are  talking about Federal probation officers. I think it is important to  give them a debt of gratitude.   But they are not police officers. They are probation officers. Their  training is quite different. Their role is quite different. They are to  engage in a constructive relationship with the probationer,  rehabilitation, making sure they adhere to their rules and confinement  or what is detailed by the court. They do it very well; so much so,  that we have determined that the incidents are very low.   Of the 987 searches that were conducted by Federal probation  officers, only 30 involved uncooperative third parties, or 3 percent.  We would like it to be zero. Of the 1,060 searches conducted in 2016,  only 39 involved uncooperative third parties, which amounts to about  3.7 percent.   But I agree, no probation officer should be subjected to encountering  any manner that threatens them. But this legislation is vague; it is  constitutionally weak. It is weak as relates to the Constitution. Its  premises, as unopposed and interfered, invite abuse.   I still maintain that many of these probation officers go to the  homes of either the probationer or their family, and likely, in many  instances, it is close individuals.   I believe probationers can be assisted by law enforcement officers.  Remember, the training is distinctly different. What it lends itself to  is overbroad interpretations of interference with probation officers,  whose duties may lead to overzealous exercise of arrest authority,  which does violate the Constitution.   We are now looking at ways to work with law enforcement, and the  solution would not be even more training, because we do not want to  turn probation officers into police officers, which would undermine the  constructive role probation officers have in the rehabilitation of  supervisees. Detaining, arresting, and issuing orders to family,  friends, employers, and coworkers of supervisees will not advance the  goals of supervision but would escalate conflict and lead to greater  danger.   These are high goals that my colleagues have spoken of, and I  certainly believe that these are worthy goals, but I would offer to say  that third parties are not in the same position as those who are  supervised with respect to their rights. They have given up none of  their rights and should not be detained or arrested in violation of the  Fourth Amendment. It is and can be a violation of the Fourth Amendment,  of unreasonable search and seizure. It is too vague a description to  allow an onsite determination as to whether someone should be arrested.   So, in the name of the respect and dignity of all and the  appreciation of probation officers, if they view the situation as  inappropriate or threatening, as the law allows, those cases should be  investigated and prosecuted, but they can call law enforcement  officers. Federal probation officers should never be threatened,  intimidated, assaulted, or precluded from doing their jobs.  Nevertheless, H.R. 1039, rather than improving their ability to execute  their responsibilities, would, unfortunately, have the opposite result.   In addition to presenting the constitutional concerns, the bill fails  to provide an acceptable, practical, or necessary preventative measure.  Further, as the public defenders of New York have indicated, the Fourth  Amendment does not permit probation officers to exercise this lesser  included power. Under an exception to the Fourth Amendment's probable  cause requirement, police officers, when executing a search warrant,  are permitted to temporarily restrain third parties, absent probable  cause for arrest, including by using handcuffs.   Holding such detentions to be reasonable, the Supreme Court  emphasized the fact of prime importance: that the search was authorized  by a neutral magistrate's finding of probable cause to search the  premises. That is not what the probation officer comes into that place  with. They are not a law enforcement officer.   In caution to our efforts to recognize and respect these fine men and  women, let us find a different way, and let us adhere to the  established law that will protect the probation officer and all those  whom he or she may come in contact with.   Again, with great respect for law enforcement and those who serve, I  would ask my colleagues to recognize the broadness and vagueness of  this legislation and oppose it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  0945     Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, my amendment preserves the trust and  integrity between probation officers and supervisees while ensuring  public safety.   While I understand the intended goal in the underlying bill, there  are some unique concerns that it raises, and my amendment addresses and  will, I believe, provide additional information.   My amendment calls for a comprehensive study by the GAO of the newly  granted authority to determine the impact on probationers, supervisees,  third parties, and the overall probation practice, if that authority is  so granted by the vote of this body. This study shall sunset at 30  months after the effective date of this act.   These are concerns that we should all have if we want to ensure that  this bill works and reaches its intended purpose, if it is voted on by  my colleagues and passes.   In allowing the study, we will ascertain information that we  otherwise would not have but would have learned had we proceeded with a  hearing on this bill.   This amendment will focus on the bill's impact in application. The  study will first review instances of abuse of power in the exercise of  such arrest authority.   Second, it will document any complaints made and/or filed regarding  the exercise of the probationer's arrest authority of third parties.   Third, it will study any harm resulting from the exercise of such  arrest authority, including any civil action alleging the violation of  a civil right in the exercise of this expanded authority.   I am confident that my colleagues would agree that public safety is  paramount, the safety of the probation officer is paramount, the safety  of those who are in the immediate custody of the probationer, and, of  course, those other individuals.   We want this to be a sound policy, so implementing sound policies  will foster trust and, thereby, public safety.   I want to thank the Rules Committee for making my amendment in order,  and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the Jackson Lee  amendment.   While I understand the intended goal in the underline bill, there are  some unique concerns that it raises and my amendment addresses and will  fix those concerns.   My amendment calls for a comprehensive study by GAO of the newly  granted authority, to determine its impact on probationers,  supervisees, third parties and the overall probation practice. This  study shall sunset at 30 months after the effective date of this act.

In allowing the study, we will ascertain information that we  otherwise, do not have but would have learned had we proceeded with a  hearing on this bill.

Third, it will study any harm resulting from the exercise of such  arrest authority, including any civil action alleging the violation of  a civil right in the exercise of this expanded authority.   I am confident that my colleagues would agree that public safety is  paramount and that we should do everything we can to ensure that we are  implementing sound policies that will foster trust and thereby, public  safety.   The Rules Committee saw it fitting to rule my amendment in order, and  now I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment.  [[Page H4369]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I believe this amendment is a very  important amendment, and I believe that it provides the kind of  guidance that is necessary because it is a clear ascertaining of the  impact.   Remember, we are talking about possible constitutional ramifications.  Unreasonable search and seizure. We are talking about not having  assaults against police officers. There is a law that will already  provide for that protection, as well as the fact that probation  officers who are not police officers can, in fact, have the ability of  law enforcement backup or support.   In addition, we realize that there is a greater burden on law  enforcement officers in an arrest situation. That burden is not on the  probation officer because they are not a law enforcement officer.   It is important for this study to be enacted so that we have the  facts. Do we not, as legislators, want to have the facts regarding the  Constitution and the impact it may have?   So I would ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment. It  is, in fact, not an amendment that negates, if this bill passes, the  acts of the probation officer. But what it does do is study whether  there is an enhanced impact and whether grandmother, mother, a little  child, an aunt, or an uncle, in the sanctity of their home, are  unreasonably detained or arrested.   We as Americans should at least be concerned about the rights of our  fellow citizens and be able to respect them in their home. A probation  officer has the right to call in a law enforcement officer if the  actions of the home, or wherever that individual happens to be, gets in  a way that interferes with his or her ability to arrest his  probationer.   Let me remind everyone that the relationship between a probation  officer and a probationer is a constructive one, one of rehabilitation.  And, sadly, if on one incident, or 39 incidents, or 3 percent of the  incidents, if something occurs, that probation officer has the right to  be able to call a law enforcement officer to assist.   This study is a constructive, forthright study to help us better  protect the rights of citizens and of the Constitution of the United  States.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from the Federal  Defenders of New York, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human  Rights, and the ACLU opposing the underlying bill.                                                Federal Defenders of                                                  New York, Inc.,                                       New York, NY, March 30, 2017.      Re Probation Officer Protection Act of 2017 (H.R. 1039)      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chair, House Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. John Conyers, Jr.,      Ranking Member, House Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Trey Gowdy,      Chair, House Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland           Security, and Investigations, Washington, DC.      Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      Ranking Member, House Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism,           Homeland Security, and Investigations, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Goodlatte, Mr. Conyers, Mr. Gowdy and Ms. Jackson       Lee: We write on behalf of the Federal Public and Community       Defenders in response to inquiries for our views on H.R.       1039, which would amend 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3606 to give probation       officers the authority to arrest, without a warrant, persons       not subject to court supervision if there is probable cause       to believe that the person has impeded or interfered with a       probation officer in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 111. The       bill was introduced last Congress, and we understand that       there has been discussion of it being introduced again.        We oppose the bill because it would violate the Separation       of Powers, would invite Fourth Amendment violations, is       unnecessary for purposes of supervision or safety, and would       instead escalate the risk of harm to all concerned and       undermine effective supervision. The arrest or detention (to       any degree) of persons not subject to court supervision       should be left to law enforcement officers.                                   Summary         The bill would violate the Separation of Powers. Probation       officers serve as administrative units employed by Article       III courts. Congress may not assign to them the executive       function of enforcing a criminal statute against private       citizens not subject to court supervision. The bill would       also undermine the integrity of the Judicial Branch by       putting courts in the position of ruling on the       constitutionality of arrests by their own agents, who are       also interested arresting officers and alleged victims of an       offense.        The bill would create serious Fourth Amendment problems.       Assuming probation officers would use the bill's arrest       authority only to formally arrest persons believed to have       violated Sec. 111, the bill would result in Fourth Amendment       violations. Because Sec. 111 is notoriously unclear,       probation officers would inevitably arrest persons who are       merely ``uncooperative'' but have not actually violated the       statute. To allay concerns about giving probation officers       the equivalent of police power over private citizens, the       Judicial Conference assures Congress that probation officers       would rarely make formal arrests but would instead exercise a       ``lesser included'' power to control or temporarily restrain       third parties short of formal arrest. But the Fourth       Amendment would not permit probation officers to exercise       such ``lesser included'' power. In holding that the Fourth       Amendment allows police officers to temporarily restrain       third parties during a search, the Supreme Court deemed it       ``of prime importance'' that the officer had a warrant based       on probable cause to search the premises. The bill would not       change the fact that probation officers conduct searches       without a warrant based on probable cause. Thus, any       restraint of a third party by a probation officer absent       probable cause to arrest would violate the Fourth Amendment.  [[Page H4370]]         The bill is unnecessary. Probation officers have authority       under current law to search the homes of people they       supervise (without a warrant or probable cause) and to arrest       them for violating conditions of supervision (with probable       cause). Pursuant to Judiciary Policy, probation officers have       long relied on trained law enforcement officers to provide       support during searches, including by managing third parties       not under probation officers' supervision. No evidence has       been presented, and we have found none, of any instance in       which law enforcement officers have not assisted when asked,       or in which anyone has been hurt by a third party during a       search. Allowing probation officers to restrain and arrest       third parties would likely increase, not diminish, any risk       of harm.        The bill would undermine effective supervision. The bill       represents a retreat from the current constructive role of       probation officers in reintegrating offenders into society.       If probation officers assumed the role of police, directing       and restraining, or arresting, family and friends, progress       in individual cases and the system as a whole would be       undermined.                                  Background         Under current law, probation officers have limited special       authority to conduct searches and seizures of persons on       probation or supervised release for the sole purpose of       assisting the district courts in supervising those persons.       They are permitted, with or without a warrant, to conduct a       search of a supervisee's home based only on ``reasonable       suspicion'' that there is evidence on the premises that the       supervisee has violated a condition of his or her       supervision, and to arrest a supervisee whom they have       ``probable cause to believe has violated a condition'' of his       or her supervision.        Judiciary Policy directs probation officers, in planning a       search, to ``strongly consider requesting assistance from law       enforcement officers for protection, instruction, and taking       possession of contraband during a search,'' and to terminate       any search ``if it is unsafe for the [probation] officer to       continue.''        Probation officers are further directed that they ``may not       restrain third parties during a search.'' This is so because       there is no authority for probation officers to detain third       parties. The Supreme Court's decisions holding that the       Fourth Amendment allows police officers to detain third       parties during a search do not apply to probation officers,       who both lack general law enforcement authority, and conduct       searches in the absence of a finding by a neutral magistrate       of probable cause to search the premises. Instead, probation       officers rely on law enforcement officers to manage third       parties if needed, thereby avoiding Fourth Amendment       violations and reducing any risk of harm.              A. The bill would violate the Separation of Powers         H.R. 1039 would authorize probation officers to arrest,       without a warrant, a person not subject to supervision if       there is probable cause to believe the person has interfered       with or impeded a probation officer ``while in the       performance of his or her official duties'' in violation of       18 U.S.C. Sec. 111. By its terms, the statute would authorize       probation officers to make such arrests at any time or       place--during a search of a supervisee's home, on the street       or at a place of business, or during a meeting at the       probation officer's office.        By authorizing probation officers to enforce Sec. 111       against private citizens not subject to court supervision,       H.R. 1039 would violate the Separation of Powers. Probation       officers are employed by the Judicial Branch to serve as       administrative units of the district court, appointed by the       court and removable by the court. A probation officer       performs no Article III function, but serves a statutory duty       to assist the court in supervising offenders.        Detecting crimes and enforcing criminal laws, in contrast,       are ``quintessential law enforcement functions vested in the       Executive Branch.'' Just as Congress may not confer executive       duties ``of a nonjudicial nature'' on Article III judges,       Congress may not enlist an administrative arm of the Judicial       Branch to perform an executive function.        This is not only a formalistic concern. A probation officer       who has arrested a private citizen for impeding the probation       officer in his duties would naturally have a direct, personal       interest in both the legality of the arrest and the outcome       of any resulting criminal case. The court, in turn, is the       probation officer's employer. When ruling on a challenge to       the constitutionality of an arrest by a probation officer,       the court would thus review the actions of its own agent, who       is also the interested arresting officer and alleged victim       of an offense. By putting the court in the triple position of       judge, vicarious victim, and arresting agent of ordinary       citizens, H.R. 1039 would undermine the integrity of the       Judicial Branch.          B. The bill would create serious Fourth Amendment problems         Subject to ``only a few specifically established and well       delineated exceptions,'' the Fourth Amendment prohibits       police officers from detaining persons (to any degree) absent       probable cause or ``prior approval by judge or magistrate.''       Even assuming probation officers used the bill's arrest       authority for no other purpose but to make formal arrests       based on probable cause that a person has violated Sec. 111,       the bill would result in unconstitutional detentions.        Section 111 prohibits ``forcibly'' assaulting, resisting,       opposing, impeding, intimidating, or interfering with an       officer ``while engaged in'' the performance of official       duties. While one would think that ``forcible'' conduct is       easy to recognize in this context, the term is notoriously       ambiguous, involving a ``troublesome question of degree.'' No       physical contact is required even for assault, and       ``forcibly'' has been held to cover such conduct as a       ``fighting stance'' with an ``uncooperative attitude,'' but       not to cover running away and struggling when tackled by       police. The statute is ``not a model of clarity,''       ``inartfully drafted,'' and leaving ``major ambiguities,''       often requiring many pages of legal analysis to decipher.        If even the courts find the statute unclear, a probation       officer surely cannot be expected to make an accurate on-the-      scene assessment of probable cause that a person has violated       it. Some probation officers would inevitably use their new       authority to arrest persons who are merely       ``uncooperative''--such as by refusing to identify       themselves, declining to open a door, or attempting to leave       the scene of a search--but who have not violated Sec. 111.       The bill would thus invite Fourth Amendment violations.        To allay potential concerns about giving probation officers       the equivalent of police power over private citizens, the       Judicial Conference assures Congress that probation officers       would rarely make formal arrests for violations of Sec. 111.       Instead, they would use a purported ``lesser included''       authority, during ``searches and other work-related contacts       (e.g., home visits),'' to ``verbally or if necessary by       temporarily restraining'' (i.e., with handcuffs)       ``uncooperative or hostile'' third parties short of arrest.       Probation officers would not need probable cause to believe       that a third party had violated Sec. 111 in order to exercise       this ``lesser-included'' authority; instead, they would       direct, control and temporarily detain third parties whom       they merely suspect have violated or will violate Sec. 111,       or believe to present a ``potential safety risk.''        But the Fourth Amendment does not permit probation officers       to exercise this ``lesser included'' power. Under an       exception to the Fourth Amendment's probable cause       requirement, police officers, when executing a search       warrant, are permitted to temporarily restrain third parties       absent probable cause for arrest, including by using       handcuffs. In holding such detentions to be ``reasonable,''       the Supreme Court emphasized the fact--``of prime       importance''--that the search was authorized by a neutral       magistrate's finding of probable cause to search the       premises.        Probation officers, however, conduct searches without a       warrant based on a finding of probable cause by a neutral       magistrate, and they conduct home visits with no suspicion at       all. For these reasons, the Administrative Office of the U.S.       Courts in 2007 reaffirmed its policy that probation officers       ``may not restrain'' ``restrict[] the movement of third       parties'' present during a search. Under established Fourth       Amendment law, third parties are ``under no obligation to       cooperate and must be free to leave.'' The AO's General       Counsel correctly noted that ``increas[ing] [probation]       officers' statutory arrest authority under Sec. 3606'' would       not solve the Fourth Amendment problem because probation       officers would still conduct searches without a warrant based       on probable cause.        Likewise, H.R. 1039 would not change the fact that       probation officers conduct searches without a warrant based       on a finding of probable cause, the factor ``of prime       importance'' to the constitutionality of police officers       restraining third parties during a search. As a result, any       restraint or control of third parties by probation officers       absent grounds for arrest would be an unconstitutional       detention. The bill does not obviate this fundamental Fourth       Amendment problem.                          C. The bill is unnecessary         U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services reported that in both       2014 and 2015, probation officers encountered third patties       described as ``uncooperative'' (defined to include refusal to       identify themselves, to come out of a closed room, or to       remain in a designated area) in only 3 percent of reported       searches. Only two incidents of any significance were       reported. In one, the supervisee's mother drove her car       toward two officers ``in an apparent attempt to hit them,''       but law enforcement officers were present and able to take       any action needed. In the other, a third party ``refused to       come out'' of a closed room, but law enforcement officers       were present, forced the door open, and found the person       swallowing marijuana cigarettes.        Nonetheless, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers       Association (``FLEOA'') claims that there is, a new       ``heightened danger in field and office contacts'' and that       giving probation officers third-party arrest authority is the       ``only [] solution.'' It claims that probation officers'       ability to enlist law enforcement officers ``provides little,       if any, help'' because sometimes only one police officer is       available. It gives three anecdotal examples, but they do not       support the FLEOA's argument, and in fact demonstrate that       the bill is not the ``only solution,'' much less a safe       solution.        In the Northern District of Alabama, probation officers       came to see their supervisee, but he was not at home. They       were leaving the premises when they encountered his father,       who was intoxicated, made threats, and threw an empty liquor       bottle at their car.  [[Page H4371]]       The probation officers drew their weapons, called 911, got       behind their vehicle, then drove away. The FLEOA states that       with arrest authority, the probation officers ``would have       taken the third party into custody for assaulting them and       for damaging government property.'' But the FLEOA does not       explain why this would have been necessary for the purpose of       supervising the son, who was not there, or to ensure anyone's       safety. The police were fully capable of subduing or       arresting the father, and most likely did, though that detail       is omitted. Had the probation officers confronted the father,       with guns drawn, they, the father, or innocent bystanders,       including the offender's cooperative mother, may well have       been hurt.        In the District of Utah, probation officers knocked on the       door of their supervisee's residence and were told by his       girlfriend that he was not at home and that no one else was       there. The probation officers ``ultimately encountered two       third party felons hiding in separate locations,'' one of       whom was suspected of homicide. The officers ``issued their       verbal commands,'' and the man became confrontational and       challenged the officers to ``shoot him.'' The officers       retreated, and ``local police ultimately subdued the third       party and took him into custody.'' Again, the FLEOA does not       explain how arrest authority would have increased the       probation officers' or public safety any better than the       police in fact accomplished.        In the Southern District of New York, probation officers       looking to confirm that their supervisee did not live at his       reported residence were ``confronted'' outside the residence,       where the supervisee apparently did not live, with ``a       belligerent, unknown, third party.'' A physical altercation       ensued, when ``another third party charged forward swinging a       pipe wrench.'' The officers used pepper spray and left. The       FLEOA asserts that the probation officers ``did not have the       option to control the third parties,'' but instead were       ``forced to retreat.'' But the FLEOA does not explain how       controlling the third parties, which would likely have       escalated a potentially dangerous confrontation, was safer       than retreat, much less the ``only solution.'' The probation       officers' mission was not urgent, and they were free to       return with police support.        The Judicial Conference provides no empirical evidence or       even anecdotal examples illustrating the purported need for       H.R. 1039. It says that, ``in the absence of other law       enforcement officers acting in a supporting role,'' a       supervisee can work with a ``hostile or uncooperative'' third       party ``to conceal violations of the terms of supervision, or       even new criminal activity.'' But the solution is the very       one suggested and that has been directed by Judiciary Policy       and followed by probation officers all along: obtain support       from law enforcement officers.        There is not a single instance cited in the U.S. Probation       Search-and-Seizure reports, in the FLEOA's proposal or recent       letter, or in the Judicial Conference's proposal or recent       letter, in which probation officers requested law enforcement       assistance in advance, or called for assistance from the       scene, and law enforcement declined to assist or failed to       show up. One of the dangers of the bill is that probation       officers would not request law enforcement support, thinking       they can handle any problems with their arrest authority. But       potential problems are best averted by law enforcement       officers, who not only have arrest authority, but ``provide       perimeter security, manage third parties, provide special       services such as K9 support, and conduct initial security       sweeps.''              D. The bill would undermine effective supervision         H.R. 1039 represents an unfortunate retreat from the       current role of probation officers, which has evolved from an       oppositional focus on enforcement and punishment to a       constructive collaboration aimed at addressing clients'       criminogenic needs, reducing their risk of recidivism, and       reintegrating them into society. These ``concerted efforts to       bring to life state-of-the-art evidence-based supervision       practices into the federal system'' coincide with       ``[m]easurable decreases in federal recidivism.'' As the       Judicial Conference has recognized, supporting the offender       ``in efforts to turn away from criminal conduct . . . will       necessarily . . . promote public safety.'' And it has       cautioned that searches ``may undermine the rapport that an       officer has developed with an offender and may hinder the       progress that an offender has made.'' We fear that the       progress that has been made in individual cases and in the       system as a whole would be undermined if probation officers       assumed the role of police, directing, restraining and       arresting family and friends, and potentially escalating the       risk of confrontation and danger to all concerned.

Oppose H.R. 1039, The Probation Officer Protection Act of 2017         Dear House Judiciary Committee Member: On behalf of The       Leadership on Civil and Human Rights and the 16 undersigned       organizations, we urge you to oppose H.R. 1039, the Probation       Officer Protection Act of 2017 (POPA), which would broadly       authorize federal probation officers to make warrantless       arrests of parties not under their supervision. Authorizing       probation officers to arrest third parties is unnecessary and       dangerous; would inhibit successful reentry; and would       implicate serious constitutional concerns. Moreover, there       are alternatives available that ensure the protection of       probation officers while avoiding the pitfalls of broadly       expanding their arrest authority.                      POPA GIVES BROAD ARREST AUTHORITY         Under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3606, a federal probation officer has       the authority to arrest a probationer or person on supervised       release if the probation officer has probable cause to       believe that the probationer has violated a condition of his       or her release. Currently, federal probation officers are not       permitted to arrest third parties. POPA would amend 18 U.S.C.       Sec. 3606 to permit probation officers to arrest ``a person       without a warrant if there is probable cause to believe that       the person has forcibly assaulted, resisted, opposed,       impeded, intimidated, or interfered with a probation officer,       or a fellow probation officer, in violation of section 111.       In other words, probation officers would be authorized to       arrest--without a warrant--any third party on the scene who       the officer claims is ``interfering'' with their work. This       broad definition of behavior triggering third party arrest       authority raises Fourth Amendment concerns.                             POPA IS UNNECESSARY         There is no evidence that expanding federal probation       officers' warrantless arrest authority is necessary.       Statistics from the Federal Law Enforcement Officers       Association (FLEOA) show that only 2 percent of searches       conducted by federal probation officers in 2013 resulted in       any confrontation with ``uncooperative'' third parties.       Furthermore, of the 909 searches conducted by federal       probation officers in 2013, only seven led to the arrest of a       third party when probation officers sought the assistance of       local law enforcement. Similarly, in 2014, only 1.7 percent       of the 1,566 searches conducted by probation officers       involved any ``reportedly uncooperative'' third parties, and       only five of these encounters resulted in a third party       arrest by local law enforcement.                           POPA WOULD BE DANGEROUS         Members of Congress should be reluctant to extend law       enforcement-like powers to anyone not trained as a law       enforcement officer--and probation officers are not police       officers. Federal probation officers complete only six weeks       of orientation training. In contrast, new law enforcement       officers complete 16 to 21 weeks of classroom training and       they often must complete three additional weeks of on-the-      ground field training. If probation officers try to confront,       restrain, and arrest uncooperative third parties, they are       likely to heighten the physical danger they face in the       field, not reduce it. The threat of arrest--and therefore       physical seizure--could increase and escalate the physical       confrontations between probation officers and third parties.       De-escalation is the desirable outcome--not an extended       violent altercation in which probation officers attempt to       arrest third parties. In North Carolina, a probationer died       while his probation officer attempted to arrest him.       Incidents that result in violence or in arguably unlawful       arrest may create expensive and time-consuming litigation for       the U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services System. Instead of       engaging hostile third parties, probation officers should       remove themselves from dangerous situations and call for the       assistance of trained local law enforcement who are fully       prepared to handle hostile situations. Probation officers       already do this, and it works.                    POPA WOULD INHIBIT SUCCESSFUL REENTRY         Allowing probation officers to arrest third parties would       also inhibit successful reentry for probationers. Part of the       benefit of the probation system is that it allows       probationers to live in society with their families while       they serve out their sentences and transition to full reentry       into the community. But the prospect of arrest for the       individuals who agree to help with the probationer's reentry       may deter them from serving as hosts and may make it harder       to achieve this transition successfully. Probation officers       must have reasonable suspicion to conduct a warrantless       search of a probationer's home; absent reasonable suspicion,       the probationer or a third party must consent to a search and       may limit the consent to search only to public areas. But if,       for example, a mother, who has opened her home to her son on       probation, blocks a probation officer from searching her       bedroom for various reasons (e.g., because her grandchildren       are in the bedroom), under POPA she could be arrested for       ``interfering'' with the probation officer. Such scenarios       could deter people from agreeing to host probationers who  [[Page H4372]]       have nowhere else to live. This would undermine the probation       system. These scenarios also threaten an innocent third       party's ability to exercise his or her Fourth Amendment       rights.                        THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES TO POPA         Since 2006, more than 80 state and county criminal justice       departments have adopted the Effective Practices in Community       Supervision (EPICS) model to improve relationships between       probation and parole officers and their probationers or       parolees. EPICS focuses on behavioral change rather than       threats of re-incarceration and officers play a more direct       role in changing criminal behavior. Reducing the hostility       between the probationer and the probation officer will likely       cause less hostility between the officer and third parties as       well.        Probation officers can protect themselves by enlisting the       help of trained law enforcement. Every jurisdiction gives       probation officers the option of calling law enforcement       officers for support when conducting home visits, and law       enforcement officers can arrest hostile third parties if       necessary. In Connecticut, probation officers do not have the       authority to make arrests but they may detain an individual       for a reasonable time until a law enforcement officer arrives       or transport the individual to the nearest location where a       law enforcement officer can make an arrest. Calling more       fully-trained law enforcement for backup is likely to prevent       the situation from becoming more volatile, and it is       therefore preferable to probation officer arrests.       Additionally, probation officers can be better trained on de-      escalation techniques and strategies to improve the       relationship between the probation officer and the       probationer.        Probation officers' role within our judicial system is to       assist with a probationer's transition back into society and       report to the court on a probationer's progress. To expand       probation officers' authority to allow probation officers to       arrest--without a warrant--any person whom they claim is       opposing or impeding their work in some way is unnecessary,       likely to be dangerous, and would inhibit successful reentry.       For the probation system to work, we need the cooperation of       the third parties contemplated by this bill--family and       friends--assisting probationers and individuals on supervised       release as well as the probation officers visiting them. The       threat of arrests of third parties in a probationer's       environment will erode the goodwill necessary for that vital       cooperation.        For the foregoing reasons, we urge you to oppose the       Probation Officer Protection Act of 2017.

Re ACLU Opposes H.R. 1039, The Probation Officer Protection           Act (POPA) of 2017.       Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.      Hon. John Conyers, Jr.,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers: On       behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), we urge       you to oppose H.R. 1039, the Probation Officer Protection Act       (POPA) of 2017, a bill that would amend 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3606       to give federal probation officers authority to arrest third       parties without a warrant. The ACLU represents almost 2       million members, activists, and supporters who are working to       advance the ACLU's mission of defending the principles of       liberty and equality embodied in our Constitution and our       civil rights laws.        H.R. 1039 is a solution in search of a problem since there       is no statistical or evidence otherwise to support the need       to expand federal probation officers' arrest authority.       Federal probation officers are not at substantial risk from       third parties. Additionally, H.R. 1039 creates safety       concerns for both probation officers and the community and       has the potential of violating a third party's Fourth       Amendment rights.      THE PROBATION OFFICER PROTECTION ACT IS A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A                                  PROBLEM         There is no evidence suggesting that federal probation       officers need arrest authority beyond what is currently       authorized by law. One of the bill's primary proponents, the       Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA), offers       no helpful statistics to support the position that federal       probation officers need third party arrest authority. FLEOA's       statements are actually counter to their position. In a       January 6, 2017, letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee,       FLEOA itself admits that ``formal arrests by probation       officers are rare.'' There is no data-driven imperative for       expanding federal probation officer arrest authority.        In fact, the Federal Probation & Pretrial Officers       Association (FPPOA) February 13, 2017, letter states that in       2015, of the 987 searches that were conducted, only 30       involved uncooperative third parties. That is 3%. And       furthermore, FPPOA does not indicate how many of those 30       incidents resulted in actual arrests. With federal probation       officers' encounters involving so few uncooperative third       parties and apparently even fewer incidents that actually       result in arrest, the federal probation officers' own       statistics lead to the conclusion that there is no need for       probation officers to execute arrests of third parties. When       probation officers face genuine physical danger, they should       retreat and seek the assistance of trained law enforcement.    THE PROBATION OFFICER PROTECTION ACT WOULD PUT PROBATION OFFICERS IN                                   DANGER         Probation officers are not trained law enforcement       officers, so they should not be given increased police       powers, the exercise of which could put them in harm's way.       If probation officers are given authority to restrain and       arrest uncooperative third parties, they are likely to       heighten the physical danger for themselves and third       parties.        Instead of engaging with resistant third parties, probation       officers should rely upon the assistance of trained local law       enforcement. This is the existing practice of probation       officers, and according to their own statistics, this seems       to work. Currently, federal probation officers are required       to call in the United States Marshals or other law       enforcement in order to arrest third parties. The reason is       that probation officers lack the training necessary to safely       execute an arrest, while the other law enforcement agents       have the capacity to do so. Federal probation officers       complete only six weeks of orientation training. New law       enforcement officers complete 16 to 21 weeks of classroom       training and they often must complete three additional weeks       of field training.   THE PROBATION OFFICER PROTECTION ACT IS OVERLY BROAD AND RAISES FOURTH                             AMENDMENT CONCERNS         Federal probation officers would be authorized in POPA to       arrest ``a person without a warrant if there is probable       cause to believe that the person has forcibly assaulted,       resisted, opposed, impeded, intimidated, or interfered with a       probation officer, or a fellow probation officer.''       Currently, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3606 authorizes probation officers       to arrest probationers without a warrant based on probable       cause that the probationer has violated the conditions of his       or her probation or release. However, probation officers do       not have the training or on the job experience to make       probable cause determinations necessary to make arrests of       third parties compared to local law enforcement officers and       the U.S. Marshals.        A real world implication of giving federal probation       officers third party arrest authority could be that the       mother of a son on probation is arrested for denying a       probation officer access to her private space, like her       bedroom. This bill would give a probation officer authority       to decide that the mother's decision constituted       ``interference'' and subsequently arrest her. Although       probationers willingly surrender some of their Fourth       Amendment rights as a condition of probation, third parties       housing a probationer do not when it comes to their private       spaces.       THE PROBATION OFFICER PROTECTION ACT HINDERS SUCCESSFUL REENTRY         Allowing probation officers to arrest third parties would       also inhibit successful reentry for probationers. Part of the       benefit of the probation system is that it allows       probationers to live in society with their families while       they serve out their sentences and transition to full reentry       into the community. But the prospect of arrest for       individuals who assist people on probation reentering their       communities may deter family members from providing a home to       people on probation. This also runs counter to part of the       mission of the U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services, which is       ``to bring about long-term positive change in individuals       under supervision.''        For the reasons above, the ACLU opposes the Probation       Officer Protection Act and we urge the Members to oppose this       legislation when it is considered by the Committee.
