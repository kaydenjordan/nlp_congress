 Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to bring the HAVEN Act to a  vote on the House floor today; and I thank Chairman Nadler, our  subcommittee chair; Mr. Cicilline, my Republican cosponsor; Mr. Steube,  and all the cosponsors who supported the expeditious passage of this  bill. I want to thank the veterans and the advocates for putting their  support behind this legislation as well.   I introduced the HAVEN Act to support veterans facing significant  financial hardship. No one wants to turn to bankruptcy. It is a path  toward debt relief that carries serious financial consequences.   But it is an important option for those with the most serious  financial circumstances, and we must make sure our bankruptcy system is  serving our veterans. These servicemembers deserve an opportunity to  get back on their feet with dignity.
