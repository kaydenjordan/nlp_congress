 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of  Madison Elizabeth Wegener of Brighton, Michigan, who was 14 when she  passed away last Tuesday.   When she was six, Maddie was diagnosed with a rare degenerative  disease that currently has no cure.   From all accounts, Maddie was a vivacious and adventurous young  woman. She loved Great Danes, taking walks in the woods, and making  maple syrup at her grandparents' farm.   Because of her illness, Maddie became an advocate for organ donation  at a young age. In her selflessness, upon her death, Maddie was able to  save four lives, and also provide the gift of sight through her organ  donations. Think about that.   Maddie's generosity of spirit sets a powerful example, as her legacy  will live on in her family, in her community, and in those that she  helped save.   Maddie was just a freshman at Brighton High School, where her mother  teaches English.   I had the privilege to attend the Brighton-Howell basketball game 10  [[Page H703]]  days ago. The students were asked to come onto the court during half  time to make a donation and take a free throw for Maddie. Students from  both schools, from every social circle, walked onto that court to  support her family.   I know that the Brighton community has rallied around her family and  today is mourning her loss. Our hearts are with her family as we honor  and celebrate the life of this remarkable young woman.                            ____________________
