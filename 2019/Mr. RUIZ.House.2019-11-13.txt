 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the thousands of  Dreamers in my district and the 800,000 Dreamers across the country  threatened with deportation due to the administration's decision to  rescind DACA.   It is unconscionable that our Dreamers are now at risk of being  separated from their families and removed from the only country they  know as home.   In addition to the sound economic, educational, and moral arguments  we are hearing today, there is another argument for DACA, one that, as  a doctor, I know needs our attention. That is the public health  argument.   Doing away with DACA would mean the U.S. could lose over 27,000  healthcare workers and support staff around the country. At a time when  we can least afford it, we would lose nurses, physicians, EMTs, and  hospital workers, people who have spent their careers making our Nation  healthier and whose absence would bring our public health great harm.   That is why I cosponsored, and the House passed, H.R. 6, the American  Dream and Promise Act, so that 800,000 Dreamers who work, are in  school, have joined the military, or are working to improve our public  health on a daily basis can live without fear of deportation.   I urge Senate Majority Leader McConnell to stop playing games and  have a vote. Let's get H.R. 6 passed.                            ____________________
