 Mr. President I rise today to share a few words today to  honor the life and legacy of Mike and Maureen Mansfield and celebrate  the 40th anniversary of the Mansfield Center.   Mike Mansfield was one of this Nation's greatest public servants,  whose legacy is not only as a Congressman, a Senator, and a diplomat,  but also as one of America's champions for the greater good, who always  put service and sacrifice before himself.   Mike planted roots in Montana at the age of 7, spending his childhood  in Great Falls raised by his aunt and uncle. After serving in three  branches of the U.S. military, Mike returned to the Treasure State,  still lacking a high school education, to work in Butte's copper mines.   In the spring of 1928, his life was forever changed when he met his  wife Maureen, a teacher who inspired him to leave the mines and further  his education. He and Maureen were married for 68 years, fostering a  lifelong partnership marked by deep devotion and respect.   After serving five terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, Mike  was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1952, and reelected again in 1958,  1964, and 1970. He served for 16 years as Senate majority leader,  quickly becoming known by Members on both sides of the aisle for his  character and high standard of public service. He was a person that got  things done, shaping the character of the modern Senate through tactful  leadership in international relations and humble dedication to public  good. And he still found time to personally read and sign every letter  to his constituents in Montana.   That is what being a Montanan meant to Mike Mansfield. He never  failed to meet challenges, reach across the aisle, and fight for  Montanans at every turn. His commitment to community and the common  good spanned six Presidents and left a lasting mark on Montana and on  the Nation as a whole. I am lucky to have learned so much from Mike  Mansfield's storied career and proud to sit in the seat he once held.   Mike and Maureen's legacy lives on in the service of the Maureen and  Mike Mansfield Center, where folks work hard to increase awareness,  advance education, and shed more light on the pressing issues facing  Montana and the world. Since its founding in 1983, the Mansfield Center  has bridged divides and fostered generations of globally minded  leaders. Whether it is through fellowships that connect top-notch  students with global leaders, critical research they are doing back in  Montana, or everything in between, the Center continues to be  instrumental in shaping the voices of tomorrow. And today, we honor 40  years of service and celebrate the immense accomplishments of all the  folks who made it possible, driven by love of country and dedication to  democracy.   Thank you to the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Center for all that you  do. Because of you, the Mansfield legacy lives on.                            ____________________
