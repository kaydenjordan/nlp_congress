 Mr. Speaker, the day is finally here. Today, we are  going to vote to make sure that our government is working for the  American people.   I would especially like to thank chair of the Appropriations  Committee, Rosa DeLauro, for her amazing patience and her steadfast  work to make this day happen, as well as Speaker Pelosi and Mr. Schumer  in the Senate.   Members, this bill will not only keep the government open so that our  constituents don't find themselves in a lot more distress with the  economic hard times that we are facing during the holiday season, but  it is also going to guarantee that children have access to healthcare,  schools remain open, hospitals can treat flu patients; so many things  that are all important to the constituents we serve.   I am especially proud of the work that I do as the Appropriations  Defense Subcommittee chair to make sure that our troops receive the pay  that they deserve, the support that their families need, the work that  I was able to do in PFAS remediation, research in healthcare, and to  work on climate change. Because all those are important to our national  security.    I will have more remarks provided in the Record.                            ____________________
