 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to give my fifth in a series of  speeches addressing what I think will be a monumental achievement of  this Senate and House when we pass our tax reform bill.   I have spoken previously about how I believe tax reform will be good  in a lot of different ways. First of all, I talked about how this tax  reform bill will spur economic growth in our country. Second, I talked  about how it would grow jobs in small businesses. Third, I talked about  the benefits working-class families will have through policies such as  the child tax credit.   So today I rise to talk about the importance of tax simplification.  According to a publisher who analyzed the issue, since 1913, the  Federal Tax Code is 187 times longer than it was a century ago. On top  of the Tax Code itself that spans thousands of pages, there are  additional IRS regulations that are complicated, and you need somebody  not just to figure them out for you and interpret them for you but to  figure out how that translates to your own tax return. Of course,  taxpayers have to comply with all of these.   Beyond the code and the regulations, there are countless IRS  procedures, technical memorandums, and more, and all of this adds to  the length and complexity of our tax system. You can see it when you  turn toward the April 15 date, the stress level in this country really  rises, and a lot of it has to do with the complications of our tax  system.   The point is this, when it comes to figuring out your taxes, it is  just far too complex. That is why businesses and individuals spend 6  billion hours a year complying with the Tax Code. That is more than 18  hours for every man, woman, and child in this country. That is  equivalent to 3 million people working full time--3 million people  working full time to comply with the Tax Code and fill out your tax  forms or, another way of looking at it, that is $195 billion in lost  productivity.   Again, our Tax Code is just too complicated, and that is also what  tax reform is about, simplifying and making it easier for Americans to  comply.   According to the Brookings Institution, ``The notion that taxes  should be simpler is one of the very few propositions in tax policy  that generates almost universal agreement.''  [[Page S6977]]    Despite years of bipartisan talks, we are now on the verge of major  tax reform for the first time in 30 years. Making our Tax Code simpler  will benefit every single working family in this country. By roughly  doubling the standard deduction, filing your taxes will be easier and  more understandable. The higher standard deduction will let more  middle-class Americans benefit from not just lower taxes but also  without the hassle of itemizing your tax return. Lower rates and fewer  deductions will help all Americans spend less time and energy and worry  on tax compliance.   Our goal is for the overwhelming number of Americans to be able to  submit their tax forms on a single sheet of paper without all those  extra forms, and for many families in West Virginia and around the  country who already use the standard deduction, increasing it will  reduce their taxes. Now, 83 percent of West Virginians last year--or  maybe it was the year before, 2015, 2016--83 percent filed a simple  form.   Simplicity in our Tax Code and relief for middle-class families,  those are the reasons I offered a straightforward amendment to the  Senate's budget resolution. My amendment said Congress should focus on  eliminating deductions that primarily benefit wealthier individuals in  favor of tax policy that benefits the middle class. Let me say that  again. Congress should focus on eliminating deductions that primarily  benefit wealthier individuals in favor of tax policy that benefits the  middle class. That means a tax code that is simpler with fewer  deductions and lower rates.   It will not just be individuals and families who benefit from a less  complicated tax code. Tax simplification will help our small businesses  start, grow, and succeed. Ninety-five percent of the businesses in my  State of West Virginia are small businesses, and they employ over half  of West Virginia's private sector workforce. So in addition to their  high marginal tax rate, the complexity and compliance cost of their  taxes impedes their economic growth, impedes their ability to grow  their job, raise their wages, spur growth. A CNBC survey found that 22  percent of small business owners aren't sure what their effective tax  rate really is. If Congress can simplify the code just to cut  compliance costs in half, that would free up significant resources that  could be used to grow the economy. Given that 50 percent of U.S. job  growth has occurred in just 2 percent of our country's counties, we  need that growth. Think about that. Over the last several years, 50  percent of the U.S. job growth has only occurred in 2 percent of our  country's counties. We need the rest of the country to be able to enjoy  that growth. To do that, we need to help the small businesses that are  the major economic drivers in our economy.   Simplifying the Tax Code will benefit so many across this country  through GDP growth and higher wages. I look forward to working with my  colleagues to make tax reform and tax simplification a reality.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
