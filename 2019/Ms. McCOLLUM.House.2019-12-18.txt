 Madam Speaker, the articles of impeachment introduced  in the U.S. House of Representatives fulfill an obligation incumbent  upon every Member of Congress to defend the Constitution, protect our  national  [[Page H12205]]  security, and ensure our democracy is not corrupted by a foreign power.  For every Member of Congress, holding the President of the United  States accountable to the Constitution and protecting our most  fundamental democratic values is not a political decision based on  loyalty or partisan affiliation. In fact, it is an inherent duty upon  which we have sworn a sacred oath.   The sole person responsible for precipitating this impeachment  process is President Donald J. Trump. President Trump's willful,  flagrant, and corrupt misconduct is a betrayal of the public trust. At  this historic and sober moment, the American people understand that as  a nation of laws there can be no person, not even the President of the  United States, who is above the law. Let these articles of impeachment  also serve as a clear and unambiguous message to all future presidents:  Congress, as a co-equal branch of government, will never tolerate or  appease an abusive, corrupt executive.   With the power granted to the U.S. House under Article I, Section 2  of the U.S. Constitution (`The House of Representatives . . . shall  have the sole Power of Impeachment'), I intend to vote in favor of the  resolution to impeach President Donald J. Trump for high crimes and  misdemeanors.
