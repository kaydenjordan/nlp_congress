 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Strange). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week, our Nation observes National  Police Week. This year, during National Police Week, we pay tribute to  143 officers who died in the line of duty during 2016--among them,  Sergeant Allen David Brandt of the Fairbanks Police Department. I come  to the floor to acknowledge not only Sergeant Brandt but all those  officers who served us so honorably.   Sergeant Brandt's wife Natasha and children, Fritz, Kate, Claire, and  Belle have traveled all the way from Fairbanks to participate in the  events this week. They are accompanied by Allen's best friend, Officer  Phil McBroom of the North Pole Police Department, as well as a large  group of colleagues from the Fairbanks Police Department, led by Chief  Eric Jewkes.   Chief Jewkes, joined by Sergeant Lockwood and Officer Werner, came  into Washington for Police Week in a somewhat unique way. They joined  2,200 officers from around the Nation in a 4-day charity bike ride from  Northern New Jersey to Washington, DC. They call it the Police Unity  Tour, and their motto is: ``We ride for those who died.''   Police Week begins with the dedication of names added this year to  the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial on Judiciary Square.  That dedication occurs during a very, very moving candlelight vigil at  the beginning of Police Week. The candlelight vigil was conducted on  Saturday evening on the National Mall this year.   Chief Jewkes, in full uniform, read Allen's name before a crowd  numbering 10,000 people or more. A bell was rung, acknowledging the  loss of Allen David Brandt. Allen's name was the only Alaska name added  to the wall this year.   I wish to thank Craig Floyd, who is the president of the National Law  Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, for the courtesy in affording Chief  Jewkes this special honor.   Allen's name is now inscribed in perpetuity on the memorial wall  among the 21,000 officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice. His  name appears on the bottom of Panel 21-East. This week, the shoulder  patch of the Fairbanks Police Department is affixed at the top of that  panel. Quite coincidentally, a few lines up on that same panel are the  names of Officers Matt Tokuoka and Anthony Wallace of the Hoonah Police  Department, who were brought down by an assailant's bullet in 2010.   During Police Week, we do not dwell on the circumstances under which  law enforcement officers gave their lives. We rather focus on how they  lived their exemplary lives, and, yes, we pay our respects to the  fallen, but Police Week also looks forward. The annual survivor's  seminar, sponsored by Concerns of Police Survivors, which helps those  who have suffered a law enforcement tragedy grieve and ultimately  recover, is an important part of this week as well.   While so much of Police Week is for the law enforcement family, those  of us in Washington cannot help but notice what is going on around us-- officers in uniform, honor guards, motorcycles, police cars from around  the country, the entire law enforcement family--Federal, State, local,  Tribal, and visiting officers from places like Canada, England, and  Israel.   Many visiting officers bring their spouses. Some bring their  children. We are able to truly see the faces behind those uniforms and  those badges, and we can look into the eyes of the families.   Let me say a few words about the children who have come in for the  observance. You see them on the Metro, sitting atop their father's  shoulders. Daddy is wearing his dress uniform. At the candlelight  vigil, one of my staff members witnessed a U.S. Park Police officer, in  uniform, explaining to her young daughter the meaning of the ceremony.  You experience the words of the children at the memorial wall itself,  where Emma Moody, the 10-year-old daughter of a fallen California  officer, left a hand-drawn memorial to her dad, and it reads:         When I get to heaven the first thing I am going to do is       find you. The second thing I will do is never ever let you go       again.    When you experience things like this, you cannot help but appreciate  the humanity behind the uniforms--a father, a mother, an aunt, an  uncle, a friend, a colleague, a neighbor. Law enforcement is no  stranger to controversy. Yet it is so important that we see beyond  controversy; that when we look at an officer we see the humanity that  runs toward danger and not from it; the humanity that responds to every  call for service, not knowing whether it will be the last; the humanity  that kisses a child goodbye before beginning a shift, not knowing  whether he will ever see those children again; the humanity that was  Allen Brandt.   The story I just recited is Allen's story. Allen was released from  the hospital after being shot five times by an assailant. He died from  complications associated with a second series of surgeries.   Allen lived long enough to appear before the Fairbanks City Council  and thank the community for their support. He also offered some very  cautionary words. He said:         Our officers do a very hard job, most of the time       thankless. Working weekends when their friends are with their       families. Working nights and sleeping during the day. We need       your support and not just when bad things happen.    A few weeks later, Anchorage Police Officer Arn Salao thought he was  responding to a call involving a dispute between a cabdriver and his  passenger. When he arrived at the scene, he was ambushed and shot four  times. Miraculously, Officer Salao survived his injuries.   In spite of these tragedies, it is dispiriting that people continue  to challenge law enforcement. Last week, Colonel James Cockrell,  retired after 30 years with the Alaska State Troopers, and just prior  to his retirement, reflected on the dangers troopers face. Assaults on  Alaska State Troopers are up, from 52 in 2013 to 131 last year.   I wish to share with the Senate a few lines from an interview with  KTUU in Anchorage. Colonel Cockrell said:         I think there's generally a little bit less respect for law       enforcement. I think a lot of that spurred from the Lower 48.       We're having troopers contact people in a one-on-one       situation. Individuals are more apt to fight with us if they       think they have an advantage, when we don't have backup. We       don't have two or three troopers responding to a high risk       crime in progress. The consequences are that people are more       apt to fight with our Troopers.    All of this is deeply tragic. As I look across the Nation, we are not  really seeing any signs of abatement. Some might be attributable to the  opioid crisis, some to a loss of respect for law enforcement, and some  simply because suspects challenge law enforcement in hopes of evading  them.   This year, law enforcement has already suffered 48 line-of-duty  deaths, 17 of those from gunfire. This fact is not lost on the officers  from Interior Alaska who are in our Nation's Capital this week. It is  not lost on those who are considering law enforcement careers but  decide to perhaps take a pass, leaving critical vacancies in agencies  throughout the country. Law enforcement remains very dangerous work,  and for all the satisfaction that comes from serving people in their  darkest  [[Page S2960]]  moments, there are no guarantees the officer will return home.   I hope that, during this National Police Week and throughout the  year, we will reflect on Allen Brandt's final words: ``Law enforcement  needs our support and not just when bad things happen.''   In these times, law enforcement needs that support now more than  ever. On behalf of my Senate colleagues, I offer my continued  condolences to Natasha Brandt and her family, to Allen Brandt's  colleagues, and to survivors of law enforcement tragedies everywhere.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
