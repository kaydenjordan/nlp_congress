 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of  Dr. Eugene ``Gene'' Morgan Hughes, a recognized leader in higher  education at the local, State, and national level.   Dr. Hughes was selected by the Arizona Board of Regents as the 12th  president of Northern Arizona University, NAU, in 1979. During his  tenure, he established NAU's Center for Excellence in Education, the  School of Hotel and Restaurant Management, and the Southwest Center for  Forestry Science Complex. Dr. Hughes launched field sites on the  campuses of Arizona's community colleges, including NAU-Yuma, and  initiated NAU-net, the first courses in the State offered via  television to off-campus sites. He also expanded the New Momentum  program to engage Native American Tribes and forged relationships with  higher education institutions in China. Under his leadership, NAU's  total enrollment rose from 12,000 to 18,800 students.   Dr. Hughes retired from NAU in 1993 and received the titles of  president emeritus and professor emeritus of mathematics. He served as  president of Wichita State University, WSU, from 1993 until 1999,  retiring as president emeritus. He later led Eastern Kentucky  University, EKU, as its interim president in 2001 before retiring to  Flagstaff, AZ.   Dr. Hughes was chairman of the American Association of State Colleges  and Universities and president of the Arizona Board of Education. He  was selected as Flagstaff Citizen of the Year in 1988 and Outstanding  Kansas Citizen of the Year in 1998. He also received the Arizona Board  of Regents Medal. The School of Hotel and Restaurant Management  building at NAU was named for him in 1997, and WSU dedicated the Eugene  M. Hughes Metropolitan Complex in 1999. Dr. Hughes received honorary  doctoral degrees from NAU in 1997 and EKU in 2011.   In retirement, Dr. Hughes remained active in the community, including  as a member of the National Advisory Board of the NAU School of Hotel  and Restaurant Management, chair of Amtrak's National Customer Advisory  Committee, and co-president of the Flagstaff Society of St. Vincent de  Paul. He was also president of the Museum of Northern Arizona.   Dr. Hughes was a kind, intelligent, and diplomatic man who listened  patiently, cared deeply, sought compromise, and treated everyone with  dignity. All who interacted with him felt seen, heard, and appreciated.  His wit, wisdom, and warm smile will be greatly missed, but his legacy  endures in the memories of all he touched. Please join me in honoring  Gene Hughes, a visionary in higher education.                            ____________________
