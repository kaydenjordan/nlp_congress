 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Korean  war veteran Jack Tolbert, who passed away this month at the age of 94.   He was a long-time resident of Redding, California, for over 50  years, and was originally a Texas native. He was awarded the  Distinguished Service Cross for his heroism in Korea.   In 1953, his outpost came under attack. A Chinese soldier hurled a  grenade into Sergeant Tolbert's bunker. In an incredible moment of  selfless bravery, Jack hurled himself on the grenade to shield his  fellow soldiers from the explosion and injury or even death. Jack lost  both his legs, among numerous other injuries.   Though he would never admit it himself, Jack truly was a hero for  having protected his brothers in arms. I knew him personally. It was  always a joy to see Jack at events in the Redding area. He was always  full of joy. He had a joke and slap on the back. He never let his  condition get him down. He was always one of the most positive people  in the room and a joy to be around.   We will miss Jack dearly, but we are all blessed to have him in our  lives, whether it was his service in Korea or his time as our neighbor  in Shasta County.   God bless him and his family.                            ____________________
