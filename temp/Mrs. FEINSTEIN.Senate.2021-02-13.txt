 Madam President, the Constitution reserves  impeachment for cases of ``treason, bribery, or other high crimes and  misdemeanors.'' Congress must never take this action lightly and only  in the most extreme circumstances.   On January 13, the House of Representatives voted 232-197 to impeach  Donald Trump on a count of inciting the insurrection that took place on  January 6.   I have taken care over the past week to fulfill my charge as an  impartial juror in this trial. I have listened carefully to the  presentations made by both sides. And I believe the House impeachment  managers proved the case that Donald Trump bears responsibility for  inciting the violence and the insurrection on January 6.   I therefore cast my vote to convict him of the impeachment charge.  The argument has been made that Donald Trump is no longer President,  thus he cannot be removed from office, as he has already left. I  understand the argument, but it fails on several counts.   First, failure to act would set the precedent that a President can  get away with anything at the end of his term. Relying on criminal  proceedings in place of impeachment is insufficient; Congress must have  the power to impeach, regardless of when actions occur. Indeed, the  House approved the Article of Impeachment when Donald Trump was still  president.   Second, there is legitimate fear that, if allowed to run for office  again, we could see an emboldened Trump wouldn't hesitate to repeat the  actions of January 6. If convicted, a simple majority vote would bar  him from running for office.   And third, a conviction would send a clear message to Trump's  followers, particularly the ones who accept violence as a legitimate  means of protest, that perpetrators of insurrection and those who  enabled them will be held responsible for their action.   As impeachment manager Diana DeGette said of the mob at the Capitol:  ``All of these people who have been arrested and charged, they're being  accountable, held accountable for their actions. Their leader, the man  who incited them, must be held accountable as well.''  [[Page S743]]    It is important to understand that Donald Trump's actions on January  6 weren't without precedent. The House impeachment managers made a  compelling case that Donald Trump has a long history of urging and  supporting violence among his supporters, knowing full well that they  would take action.   This is a key matter for this impeachment trial: Did Donald Trump's  words inspire violence? Were those carrying out the insurrection  following his direction? The House managers gave several examples of  Trump's past practice.   After Republican Congressman Greg Gianforte in 2018 pleaded guilty to  assaulting a reporter who asked him a question, former President Trump  praised him. ``Any guy that can do a body slam--he's my guy.''   After a 2017 rally of White supremacists and neo-Nazis turned violent  in Charlottesville and killed a woman, former President Trump said  there were ``very fine people on both sides.''   Last year, Trump sent a message for his followers to ``liberate  Michigan.'' Weeks later, messages threatening violence were directed  against Governor Gretchen Whitmer. And later in the fall, a plot to  kidnap Governor Whitmer emerged, led by Trump followers. President  Trump made a call to action, and his followers responded.   And during the 2020 Presidential debates, when Donald Trump was asked  if he would condemn White supremacists and other groups like the Proud  Boys, a far-right group that endorses violence, he wouldn't answer,  instead saying, ``Proud Boys--stand back and stand by.''   It is clear that Donald Trump's supporters, including those who  participated in the insurrection on January 6, heeded his words and  support of violence. The Proud Boys took Trump's words--``stand back  and stand by''--and made it their official motto. Rioters at the  Capitol told U.S. Capitol Police officers as they were threatening  violence that they had been ``invited'' by President Trump. While the  insurrection was going on, Trump supporters were reading Trump's tweets  over a megaphone. The pattern is clear: Donald Trump has no qualms  about asking his followers to commit violence. In fact, he celebrates  them when they do.   After the November 2020 elections, Donald Trump immediately set out  to undermine the results. His lawyers and his supporters filed 60  lawsuits to object to the results, as was his right under the law. But  when those cases were tossed out, then-President Trump sought to cheat.  He urged the secretary of state for Georgia to ``find'' enough votes to  declare him the victor. When officials rebuffed his efforts to reverse  his electoral loss, he led efforts to bring thousands of people to  Washington to, in his words, ``Stop the Steal.''   The day he chose was January 6, the day Congress was meeting to  certify the election results. Trump directed his followers to go to the  Capitol and to ``fight like hell.'' As was documented extensively in  this trial, Trump knew that this group was preparing for violence when  he directed them to walk to the Capitol.   What we learned this week is that Donald Trump was also aware of the  violence at the Capitol as a frenzied insurrection mob ransacked the  Capitol and sought to physically harm Members of Congress and even kill  the Vice President. After being told that Vice President had been  removed from the Senate Chamber for his safety, Trump tweeted to his  supporters that Pence lacked ``courage'' to reject the electoral  college results. This happened precisely as Trump's supporters were  building a gallows and chanting ``Hang Mike Pence.''   Indeed, new information revealed during the course of this trial  indicates that President Trump knew the state of violence in the  Capitol. One Senator has stated publicly that he told President Trump  on the phone that Vice President Pence had been removed from the Senate  Chamber by his Secret Service detail.   We have also heard on-the-record reports that in a phone call between  President Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy while the  Leader's office was under attack, then-President Trump apparently  continued to support those carrying out the violent insurrection. So  despite direct pleas from Members of Congress and the former  President's closest Republican confidants, Trump refused for hours to  call off the mob or urge calm.   As House impeachment manager Jamie Raskin said during the  presentation, ``Donald Trump surrendered his role as commander-in-chief  and became the inciter-in-chief of a dangerous insurrection.''   Five people, including a U.S. Capitol Police Officer, lost their  lives as a result of this insurrection guided by Donald Trump. And  nearly 140 officers from the Capitol Police and Washington Metropolitan  Police Department were injured, some severely.   The evidence presented this week shows that Donald Trump committed  high crimes and misdemeanors and that he should be convicted.   I thank the House managers for their hard work in making a thoroughly  compelling, convincing, and fair case, and I hope we can move past this  terrible moment in our Nation's history.                            ____________________
