 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 83, the Congressional  Review Act resolution of disapproval that will undermine workplace  safety and health. It does so by overturning a clarifying rule issued  by OSHA on December 9, 2016, to ensure accurate occupational injury and  illness reporting.   Now, first of all, it is strange that we are reversing a rule through  the Congressional Review Act that creates no new compliance or  reporting obligation, imposes no new costs. It simply gives OSHA the  tools to enforce an employer's continuing obligation to record injuries  and illnesses.   Spurred by the court of appeals decision, which blocked OSHA from  citing continuing violations outside the 6-month statute of  limitations, OSHA updated its recordkeeping rule. This new rule makes  it clear that employers have a continuing obligation to record serious  injuries and illnesses on an OSHA Log if they failed to comply with the  requirement to record the injury at the time the injury or illness  occurred.   Since the enactment of OSHA in 1970, accurate data on workplace  injuries and illnesses has been recognized as an  [[Page H1422]]  important tool for protecting worker safety and health.   Since 1972, employers in higher hazard industries have been required  to record the occurrence of each serious occupational injury or illness  within 7 days on a ``Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses.''                                time  1530    An annual summary of this law must be posted for 3 months starting in  February of each year in a conspicuous place where employees' frequent  records must be kept for 5 years.   While most employers faithfully comply with OSHA's rules, there are a  number of well-documented incentives for employers to underreport  workplace injuries. These incentives include lower workers'  compensation rates, more favorable treatment in public contracting, and  a lower chance of having a future OSHA inspection.   Underreporting means that workplace hazards are masked, making it  less likely that employers or employees become aware of patterns that  would indicate the need to take corrective actions to prevent future  injuries. If injuries and illnesses are not on the log, OSHA may  overlook hazards at a worksite during an inspection and consequently  leaving workers exposed to correctable dangers.   Mr. Speaker, because of underfunding, OSHA only has sufficient  resources to inspect a workplace once every 140 years on average. So  the likelihood that they might show up in the next 6 months is  obviously remote. To be effective, OSHA must have reliable injury and  illness data to target its scarce resources towards work sites where  employees are facing the greatest dangers. Understated injury rates may  mean that OSHA will bypass work sites that need to be inspected.   Without reliable recordable injury rates, private contractors and  public sector officials will not be able to make sufficiently informed  decisions when assessing the safety records of prospective contractors  and subcontractors.   Mr. Speaker, OSHA's practice for the last 40 years and the decisions  of the bipartisan and independent OSHA Review Commission have upheld  the principle that every day an employer fails to record an injury was  a continuing violation for the purpose of calculating time limits under  OSHA's statute of limitations. That is not totally open-ended but  limited to the 5-year requirement that employers are required to  maintain these injury records.   In spite of this 40-year precedent, a 2012 D.C. Court of Appeals  decision known as Volks Constructors upended the 40-year precedent when  it held that OSHA did not have the authority to issue a citation for an  occurrence of a violation that extended beyond the 6-month statute of  limitations as set forth in OSHA. The court noted that OSHA's previous  regulation provided for no specific articulated continuing obligation  to record injuries beyond 7 days.   There was a concurrent opinion in the Volks decision which made it  clear that a regulation, which expressly provides for an employer's  continuing obligation, would be lawful.   Now, when you talk about what the court decided and what Mr. Garland  wrote, that was on the previous regulation, not on this one.   Informed by the guidance of the court, OSHA has issued a new rule  which does make it clear that an employer's duty to maintain an  accurate record of workplace injuries and illnesses is, in fact, an  ongoing obligation.   So let's be clear, eliminating this rule means that employers who  want to underreport injuries will face no sanctions if the injuries go  back more than 6 months. Rolling back this rule essentially creates a  vast safe harbor for noncompliance and creates the perverse incentive  for underreporting.   The premise behind the resolution today is that it is unlawful. If  that is the case, Congress should repeal the regulation. But no court  has reviewed this new rule, only the predecessor. There has been no  appeal of the new rule that has been lodged since the new rule was  issued in December.   The proper course of action is to have the courts decide the legal  question since arguably they are in the best position to interpret the  laws and evaluate the precedents. This especially makes sense since one  of the concurring opinions in the Volks case identified abundant legal  precedent for tolling the statute of limitations when there are  continuing violations in other laws that are nearly identical to the  reporting requirements in OSHA. These include the Consumer Credit  Reporting Act and the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.   On the other hand, if the purpose of passing this resolution is just  to eliminate the possibility of OSHA's clarifying rule could ever be  found lawful, then it is obvious that H.J. Res. 83 is an ideological  attack without any regard for consequences to worker safety.   On the other hand, if there is a bona fide view that OSHA lacks the  adequate legal basis for the rule, then the constructive solution would  be to amend OSHA and provide for the clarifying statutory authority. We  should not be repealing the rule because we know what happens when this  deterrent is eliminated. After OSHA lost its authority to enforce the  violations outside the 6-month window under the Volks decision, there  was a 75 percent reduction in the number of citations issued for  underreporting, and that is according to OSHA data.   So, Mr. Speaker, there has been no hearing held on this final rule or  this resolution. There has been no assessment of the consequences of  underreporting of injuries which will occur if this resolution is  adopted, and there has been no evaluation of any alternative way to  ensure accountability for employers who flout the law. There has just  been a headlong rush to push this resolution to the floor just a few  days after its filing.   So given the complete lack of deliberation regarding this new rule,  this Congressional Review Act resolution is premature, at best, but it  will definitely have regrettable consequences to the health and safety  of the people that we are charged to protect.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, prior to yielding, I just want to make a comment that  the court struck down the previous rule, not the rule which is the  subject of this resolution. The previous rule did not have a specific  citation about a continuing obligation. This rule does. The excerpts  from the Garland concurring decision says:         None of this is to say, as the petitioner suggests in its       opening brief, that a statute of limitations like OSHA's       statute of limitations can never admit to a continuing       violation for a failure to act. To the contrary, where a       regulation or statute imposes a continuing obligation to act,       a party can continue to violate it until that obligation is       satisfied.    This regulation specifically cites the obligation as a continuing  obligation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume before I yield to the gentleman from Florida.   The law requires the keeping the records for 5 years. If there are  bogus records, you ought to have an obligation to keep them correct.  That has been the interpretation for 40 years, up until this decision.   We need the money to do their job. If they do their job, if we  provide them with some funding, they can show up more than once every  140-some years.   We keep talking about a court decision that affected another  resolution, not this one.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Soto).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), a hardworking member of the  Committee on Education and the Workforce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, there are 2,000 inspectors at OSHA. There are 8 million  work sites. We can't expect them to visit every 6 months when the  funding only allows them to visit each workplace once every 140-some  years. You would have to show up at each place every 6 months to catch  these violations within that timeframe.   Mr. Speaker, for 40 years, the obligation to record these injuries  has been considered a continuing obligation. If the purpose is to  overrule the regulation because it is inconsistent with the statute,  then we should fix the statute. But this resolution just gives relief  to those who fail to record injuries and illnesses in violation of  their legal obligation to do so.   As Americans discover the plan to repeal this OSHA rule through a  resolution of disapproval, there are a lot of professional  organizations, in addition to the ones that have already been  introduced, that have been alarmed by this resolution.   The American Public Health Association has written:         Injury and illness records are invaluable for employers,       workers and OSHA to monitor the cause and trends of illnesses       and injuries. Such data is essential for determining       appropriate interventions to prevent other workers from       experiencing the same harm. . . . For decades, the public       health community and government agencies have identified a       widespread undercount of work-related injuries and illnesses.       This includes investigations by the GAO, the Bureau of Labor       Statistics and academic researchers. H.J. Res. 83  [[Page H1428]]       will have dire consequences for injury prevention and       undermine 40 years of occupational injury surveillance in the       United States.    The AFL-CIO has written:         In the absence of enforcement, there is no question that       the underreporting of injuries, already a widespread problem,       will get much worse, undermining safety and health and       putting workers in danger.                                time  1600    A group of 66 professional workplace safety groups wrote:         The OSHA clarifying rule on maintaining accurate records       imposes no new costs to business, but is critical to assuring       that workplace fatalities and injuries are prevented.    Mr. Speaker, I include these letters in the Record.                                                             AFL-CIO                                               Legislative Alert,                                                  February 27, 2017.        Dear Representative: The AFL-CIO urges you to oppose H.J.       Res 83, a Congressional Review Act Resolution of Disapproval       that would repeal an Occupational Safety and Health       Administration (OSHA) rule that clarifies an employer's       responsibility to maintain accurate records of serious work-      related injuries and illnesses. This resolution will make it       impossible for OSHA to ensure that injury and illness records       are complete and accurate and undermine workplace health and       safety.        The rule, issued in December 2016, is in response to a       court decision that limited enforcement of OSHA's injury       recordkeeping regulations to a six month period--a dramatic       departure from OSHA's 40 year policy and practice. The six       month restriction makes it impossible for OSHA to enforce the       Act's injury recordkeeping requirements, since OSHA does not       have the resources to conduct regular inspections of even the       most hazardous workplaces. Indeed, currently federal OSHA is       only able to inspect workplaces on average, only once every       140 years. The new rule creates no new obligations on       employers. It simply makes clear that employers have a       responsibility to maintain accurate injury and illness       records for 5 years and during this time can be held       accountable for violations if records are not complete and       accurate.        The collection of complete and accurate information on       work-related injuries and illnesses is a cornerstone of the       Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The Act directs       the Secretary of Labor to ``prescribe regulations requiring       employers to maintain accurate records of, and make periodic       reports on, work-related deaths, injuries and illnesses other       than minor injuries.'' Since the early 1970's, OSHA has       required employers in the more hazardous industries to keep       these records and make reports to the Department of Labor.       These records form the basis of the Bureau of Labor       Statistics' (BLS) work-related injury and illness statistics       which are used to identify high-risk industries and       occupations and emerging problems and to track progress. OSHA       relies on the records to target its enforcement and       compliance assistance activities to dangerous workplaces. And       the records are used by employers, workers and unions at the       workplace to identify hazardous conditions and take       corrective action to prevent future injuries and exposures.        To ensure the accuracy of this critical information,       throughout its entire history, under every administration,       OSHA enforced injury recordkeeping requirements by reviewing       the last five years of an employer's records. This       comprehensive assessment allowed the agency to identify       widespread underreporting by some employers, which was       masking serious injuries and hazards. OSHA was able to take       strong enforcement action which brought about changes in       injury recordkeeping practices, but also led to significant       safety and health improvements to address hazards and prevent       future injuries.        Without the new rule, it will be impossible for OSHA to       effectively enforce recordkeeping requirements and assure       that injury and illness records are complete and accurate. In       the absence of enforcement, there is no question that the       underreporting of injuries, already a widespread problem,       will get much worse, undermining safety and health and       putting workers in danger.        The AFL-CIO asks you to stand up for the safety and health       of American workers and to reject H.J. Res. 83.            Sincerely,                                                    William Samuel,      Director, Government Affairs Department.                                   ____                                                     American Public                                              Health Association,                                  Washington, DC, February 27, 2017.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Chair, Committee on Education and the Workforce, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Robert C. Scott,      Ranking Member, Committee on Education and the Workforce,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Foxx and Ranking Member Scott: On behalf of       the American Public Health Association, a diverse community       of public health professionals who champion the health of all       people and communities, I write to oppose H.J. Res. 83, a       resolution that would use the Congressional Review Act to       void an important Department of Labor policy which clarifies       an employer's obligation to make and maintain accurate       records of work-related injuries and illnesses. The       Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued this       regulation in December 2016 in response to an opinion issued       by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.        Public health professionals understand the critical       importance of accurate information to help identify hazards       in order to develop and implement better health and safety       protections. One important source of that information is the       records some employers are required to keep on work-related       injuries and illnesses. These records are invaluable for       employers, workers and OSHA to monitor the cause and trends       of injuries and illnesses. Such data is essential for       determining appropriate interventions to prevent other       workers from experiencing the same harm.        The regulation clarified for employers their ongoing       obligation to maintain an accurate and complete record of       workplace injuries and illnesses. It reiterated a long-      standing policy that an employer's duty to record an injury       on an OSHA log does not expire. It explained to employers       that keeping a record of an injury is an ongoing requirement       even if an employer failed to record the injury or illness at       the time it occurred. OSHA requires employers to keep and       maintain accurate records of injuries until the five-year       records retention period expires.        For decades, the public health community and government       agencies have identified a widespread undercount of work-      related injuries and illnesses. This includes investigations       by the Government Accountability Office, the Bureau of Labor       Statistics and academic researchers. H.J. Res. 83 will have       dire consequences for injury prevention and undermine 40       years of occupational injury surveillance in the U.S.        We urge you to stand up for workers and workplace safety       and oppose this resolution.            Sincerely,                                          Georges C. Benjamin, MD.,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                                  February 28, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Chair, Committee on Education and the Workforce, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Robert Scott,      Ranking Member, Committee on Education and the Workforce,           Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Minority Leader Pelosi, Chairman Foxx,       and Ranking Member Scott: We the undersigned organizations       write in strong opposition to H.J. Res 83, a Congressional       Review Act Resolution of Disapproval that would repeal an       Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rule       that clarifies an employer's responsibility to maintain       accurate records of serious work related injuries and       illnesses. This resolution will undermine workplace health       and safety in the most dangerous industries.        This OSHA clarifying rule does not impose any new costs nor       any new obligations to covered employers, nor does it affect       small businesses. It simply clarifies OSHA's authority to       hold employers accountable for their longstanding obligation       to maintain accurate injury records, a requirement that has       been in effect since the Nixon Administration. Further, the       rule only covers larger employers in the most dangerous       industries.        For over 40 years, only larger employers in high hazard       industries have been required to maintain records of serious       work related injuries and illnesses. OSHA regulations, issued       in the 1970's, require employers to maintain records for five       years. Since then, the Department's longstanding position has       been that an employer had an ongoing duty to assure that       those records were accurate. The Department of Labor uses       these records as the basis for published statistics on       workplace injury and illness rates and OSHA uses them to       allocate scarce agency resources for compliance assistance       and enforcement. Employers use these records as a guide to       identify and fix job dangers that injure and maim workers.        This rule is needed because in 2012, a court decision       overturned 40 years of recordkeeping precedent and made it       impossible for OSHA to enforce against recordkeeping       violations in dangerous industries that are more than six       months old. One of the three judges indicated that OSHA could       enforce for continuing violations of its recordkeeping rule       if the agency clarified its regulation. The rule that is the       subject of H.J. Res 83 remedies the problem and clarifies       that OSHA may enforce for continuing violations for the       failure to record serious work related injuries and       illnesses.        Accurate injury and illness records are vitally important       to the protection of workers. They are the most important       tool that employers and government use to identify and       eliminate job hazards that kill over 4,800 workers a year and       seriously injure almost 3 million more. OSHA can only inspect       every workplace under its jurisdiction once every 140 years.       If employers have no obligation to maintain accurate records       during the five year retention period, worker health and       safety will be seriously jeopardized.        We are organizations that strongly support ensuring safer       workplaces and protecting workers from serious workplace       hazards. We ask you to stand with American workers and  [[Page H1429]]       oppose H.J. Res 83. The OSHA clarifying rule on maintaining       accurate records imposes no new costs to business, but is       critical to assuring that workplace fatalities and injuries       are prevented.
