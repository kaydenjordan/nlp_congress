 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about making our  communities healthier and safer for all Americans.   Let me start out by urging my colleagues to join me and my colleague,  Jim Sensenbrenner, in supporting the Functional Gastrointestinal and  Motility Disorder Research Enhancement Act, legislation that we are  introducing today.   There are millions of Americans who suffer from gastrointestinal and  motility disorders. These are very common gastrointestinal disorders in  the general population, but they affect tens of millions of Americans.   Symptoms of these disorders include pain in the inner organs, lack of  motility, altered immune function, and altered central nervous system  function. Although these symptoms can be life-threatening, effective  therapies exist. Treatment, generally, focuses on management of the  symptoms.   For nearly 30 years, patient advocacy organizations, like the  International Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders in  my district, have been working to support affected individuals and  their families.    Mr. Speaker, we are asking all of our colleagues to join us in  cosponsoring this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, while I am here addressing healthier and safer  communities, I would be remiss if I did not mention the need to  aggressively attack a crisis, a health crisis, a public safety crisis  that is affecting all of our communities, and that is gun violence.   Mr. Speaker, it is often said that it takes a village to raise a  child, but it takes a village to protect children, too.   That is why I am so inspired by my own hometown of Milwaukee,  Wisconsin, to see what our community is doing collectively to address  gun violence. That is why I am inspired to see that Milwaukee hospitals  are working to combat accidental shootings by offering free gunlocks as  a tool to protect children from guns in homes. The city is also working  to put violence interrupters in our community to teach people how to  deescalate violence.   Communities like Milwaukee have always stepped up when Congress falls  short, but now, Mr. Speaker, it is time for Congress to act to pass  commonsense gun violence prevention measures that have widespread  support.   It has been over 100 days, Mr. Speaker, since the House has passed  H.R. 8, strengthening background checks; H.R. 1585, the VAWA  reauthorization that includes new provisions to prevent abusers from  accessing guns; and H.R. 1112, closing the Charleston loophole that  allows individuals to get a gun if their background checks haven't been  completed within 3 days, all legislation that would prevent the gun  violence that is hurting all our communities. Yet, the Senate has  failed to act, as key Senators have opposed taking any action.   That is irresponsible.                                time  1115    We are not the only country that experiences gun violence, but it  seems that we are the only ones not to do anything about it except to  offer thoughts and prayers and moments of silence.   Well, I will tell you, no more silence over gun violence, from Sandy  Hook where 26 were killed to the Pulse nightclub shooting where 49 were  killed, to the third anniversary of the Oak Creek Sikh temple shooting  where 6 were killed, to Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida where  17 were killed, to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where, last fall, a 13-year- old girl was killed by a stray bullet. Bullets don't have eyes. This  spring, an 11-year-old was wounded by a stray bullet.   Enough is enough. Mr. Speaker, it is time for the Senate to take up  H.R. 8 and to promote health and safety in our communities.                            ____________________
