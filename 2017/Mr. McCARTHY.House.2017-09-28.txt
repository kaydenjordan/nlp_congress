 I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, before I give the schedule, I do want to say today was a  day that was very good to see our dear friend, Steve Scalise, make it  back.   As the gentleman said, an attack on him was an attack on the entire  institution. I was there that day in the hospital, my wife and I, and  waiting for Jennifer to arrive, and Steve, going through those  surgeries. The number of times we would go back to visit, he is the  strongest man I have ever known. I thought his speech today was  fantastic.   It is from the heart that he first would seek God's guidance. The  strength of Jennifer--I watched Madison and Harrison spend their entire  summer in that hospital for their father, and for him to be able to  walk back here as soon as he did and the excitement in his face when he  was able to cast that vote, I know Steve is going to continue to get  stronger as he goes, and he thanks everybody for the help they  provided.  [[Page H7616]]    We should not forget the spirit that this floor had today. We should  take that spirit into the days forward and continue it. We can  disagree, but it takes an unbelievable terrible situation, at times, to  remind us of the human spirit we have for one another, and I want to  make sure, even for myself, that I remember those moments in times of  the most heated debates.   So with that, Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for  morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be  postponed until 6:30.    On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning  hour and noon for legislative business.   On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.   Last votes of the week are expected no later than 3 p.m.   And on Friday, no votes are expected in the House.   Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next  week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business  tomorrow.   Now, in addition, the House will consider H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable  Unborn Child Protection Act, also, as I like to call it, ``Micah's  Law.''   Mr. Speaker, I spent some time on Tuesday with a young boy named  Micah. Micah gave me this bracelet, ``Miracles for Micah,'' and I wear  it because Micah was born premature at 20 weeks. If you look at a  picture of Micah, he was the size of a bag of M&Ms. Today, he is happy,  he is healthy, he is 5 years old, and no one would know the difference.   Mr. Speaker, all life is a miracle, and we have an obligation here to  speak for those who cannot speak for themselves.   I look forward to the House passing this compassionate bill next week  that will protect the lives of countless others just like Micah.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, the House will take up the FY18 budget  resolution. Our Republican budget balances within 10 years, provides  for a strong national defense, eliminates burdensome regulations, and  cracks down on waste, fraud, and abuse. Passing this budget will also  enable tax reform, which is the key to economic growth and seeing that  Americans take home more of their hard-earned dollars.   I thank Chairman Black and the entire Budget Committee--and  especially you, Mr. Speaker--for their hard work on this bill.    I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him for his  interest, and it is true, the gentleman and I were hopefully trying to  go down to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and Key West to look at  some of the damage, and, right now, the Coast Guard tells us, with the  rescue attempts that are ongoing, that we probably would be taking some  equipment away from doing that work, and we do not want to do any of  that. We will be able to go a little later when the time is right.   We will continue to work with the administration. When you think what  this country has gone through with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, I do  want to give thanks to the work of the administration. I have seen some  coordination like I have not seen in the past.   We know these are islands. The damage of the two hurricanes they have  to go through, I have been keeping in constant contact, and just  speaking with FEMA just recently, they are currently coordinating and  establishing seven temporary hospitals. That was one of my concerns  with dialysis and others, but there is so much more to do to be able to  move through, and I will work with the gentleman, as we have in the  past, to make sure whatever they need will be able to get there.                                time  1200    And I do want to thank Congressman Carlos Curbelo for his amendment  to the bill that we just voted on, adding a little more resources there  to make sure, knowing the tax code of Puerto Rico is a little different  than the one we had voted on as we go through, to give them greater  assistance, and the Virgin Islands.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   I first want to applaud Speaker Ryan for forming a working group on  this important issue. The gentleman and I have met numerous times on  this, and I have talked to the President about it, as well. He has been  very clear, and I agree with the President's position, courts have  shown that the past was unconstitutional, and that just means the House  has to do their job and the Senate. The one thing I would hate to  happen here is that we only do the job halfway, and then we have this  problem come back to us.   The President has asked us about border security, as well. I believe  we can find a solution here, together. I look forward to working with  Mr. Hoyer.   The President has challenged this Congress to find a solution, and I  believe we can. We are going to work to make sure we get it done. I  would like to do it sooner than the timeframe the President has given  us.     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I expect reconciliation in this budget. I leave it up to the Rules  Committee and the Budget Committee when they produce it, but on this  floor, I believe there will be reconciliation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   If the question is have I given up on repealing ObamaCare, the answer  is no.   So, yes, this is the budget for the rest of the year. We know the  harm that ObamaCare has brought to many Americans. The lack of  insurance, when you look at the number of counties, 40 percent of all  of the counties in America only have one provider, some have none. We  watched premiums go up.   We want a healthcare system where people have choice, that, actually,  the price is lower and the quality is better. That is something I will  never give up on, so, yes.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the only thing I want to say, and I know we have debated  this many times--we can always put an endorsement somewhere and we can  always go back and forth, but I will just tell you for my own  district--I don't know why anybody would ever say they are making a  decision based on something when our bill carries it out another 2  years even, so I don't believe that to be true.   But I know what is true. Currently, 30 percent of the people who are  on the exchange in my district just had somebody pull out; and they had  that health insurance, Anthem, so now they don't. They have to go find  something else. They had doctors who they loved, and they were promised  that they were going to be able to keep them. Well, they couldn't.   I just look at numbers; and I take Republican, Democrat, I take  whatever name is across from it. Almost twice as many people pay the  penalty or take a waiver as actually make a payment for ObamaCare.                                time  1215    So, yes, this will continue not because you and I have a  disagreement, but because people are hurting, premiums are going up,  deductibles are going up, and people are losing their providers. And  the providers are not leaving because it is staying the same way for  another 2 years, they are leaving because it is staying there.   So, yes, I look forward to continuing this conversation because we  cannot allow this harm to continue to go through this country.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   You raised a couple issues there. When it comes to teaching  hospitals, that was in the bill you just voted against twice this week  on the floor. So that has been taken care of.   When you are talking about SCHIP and the extension of that, Chairman  Walden actually postponed a markup not because he wanted to, but  because it was requested by the Democrats. So he postponed the markup  this week in continuing bipartisan negotiations.   This is something I would like to get done. I know Chairman Walden  has now scheduled a markup for next week, so I am very hopeful that we  will get this done very soon. I am a big supporter of SCHIP and a lot  of the work that they do and what it moves forward for our healthcare  in the future, especially for the health clinics out there. So I look  forward to working with you.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I apologize. You did mention the Perkins Act. I do not have that  scheduled at the current time, but I will keep you abreast when I do.    Mr. Speaker, it is our understanding that today could  be the very last time that Margarida Curtis provides a message to us on  this floor.   We would like to thank Margarida Curtis. From a very grateful nation,  thank you for your service. Many times the American people see your  voice, but also the power of what you bring back and forth to make this  democracy work. We want to thank you for your service, and we wish you  all the happiness in retirement.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 11:30 a.m. tomorrow; and  further, when the House adjourns on that day, it adjourn to meet on  Monday, October 2, 2017, when it shall convene at noon for morning-hour  debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business.
