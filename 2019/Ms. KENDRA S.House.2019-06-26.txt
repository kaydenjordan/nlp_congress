 HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate the legacy and accomplishments of Oklahomans in space.   Retired Air Force Colonel Stuart Roosa was one of six Apollo  astronauts to fly solo around the Moon.   After growing up in Claremore, Colonel Roosa studied at both Oklahoma  State University and the University of Arizona before earning a  bachelor of science degree in aeronautical engineering with honors from  the University of Colorado in Boulder in 1960. Later he graduated from  the Aviation Cadet Program at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona, where  he received his flight training commission in the U.S. Air Force.   Roosa was one of 19 people selected to the astronaut class of 1966.  Colonel Roosa served as a member of the astronaut support crew for the  Apollo 9 mission and as the command module pilot for the Apollo 14  mission from January 13 to February 9, 1971. In completing his first  spaceflight, Roosa logged a total of 216 hours and 42 minutes in space.  Following Apollo 14 he served as backup command pilot for Apollo 16 and  Apollo 17. He was assigned to the space shuttle program until his  retirement as a colonel from the Air Force in 1976.   Former NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin describes Colonel Roosa as  one of the can-do spacefarers who helped take America and all humankind  to the Moon. Goldin said that Colonel Roosa exemplified the talents  that NASA strives for: service to our Nation, technical know-how, and  an unbridled creative spirit.                       Celebrating Oklahomans in Space     HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate the accomplishments and achievements of Oklahomans in space.   Skylab was the first space station operated by the United States.  This space station spent 6 years orbiting the Earth. Within those 6  years, two Oklahomans were part of the three successive, three-man  crews to live aboard Skylab: William Pogue and Owen Garriott.   Born in Okemah, Oklahoma, Pogue joined the U.S. Air Force and fought  in the Korean war. In 1955 Colonel Pogue became a member of the  Thunderbirds, the Air Force's elite aerobatics team, and then earned a  master's degree from Oklahoma State University in 1960. In 1966 Colonel  Pogue became an astronaut and served on the support crews for the  Apollo 7, 11, and 14 missions.   The pilot of record-setting American missions in space, Pogue was one  of the few astronauts to ever go on strike while in orbit to demand  more time to contemplate the universe.   Colonel Pogue and the three-manned crew he was a part of flew the  longest and last manned mission aboard Skylab from November 16, 1973 to  February 8, 1974.   Astronaut Owen Garriott was born in Enid, Oklahoma. He earned a  bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of  Oklahoma and his master's and doctoral degrees in electrical  engineering from Stanford University.   Dr. Garriott served as an electronics officer while on Active Duty  with the U.S. Navy from 1953 to 1956 and was stationed aboard several  U.S. destroyers at sea. He was selected as a scientist-astronaut by  NASA in June 1965 and then completed a 53-week course in flight  training at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona. He logged more than 5,000  hours flying time, including more than 2,900 hours in jet and light  aircraft, spacecraft, and helicopters. Garriott was the science-pilot  for Skylab 3, the second crewed Skylab mission, and he was in orbit  from July 28 to September 25, 1973.   The crew of Skylab 3 logged 1,427 hours and 9 minutes each in space,  setting a world record for a single mission. Garriott spent 13 hours  and 43 minutes in three separate spacewalks as well. He also held the  FAA commercial pilot and flight instructor certifications for  instrument and multi-engine aircraft.   Sadly, we lost Dr. Garriott just 2 months ago at the age of 88, but  we are grateful for the contributions and the legacy set by Oklahomans,  Colonel Pogue and Dr. Garriott and their exploration in space.                            ____________________
