 Mr. Speaker, before the Affordable Care Act,  Americans suffering with cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and Parkinson's  disease could be denied health insurance coverage due to a preexisting  condition, a genetic predisposition millions of Americans are born  into. But insurance companies can't do that anymore because it is  against the law because of the Affordable Care Act.   The Trump administration wants to take away that protection and has  asked a Texas Court of Appeals to fully repeal the Affordable Care Act  and preexisting conditions protections.   This week, the House will vote to approve the Protecting Americans  with Preexisting Conditions Act. In my western New York community  alone, nearly 300,000 people need the protection for preexisting  conditions that the Affordable Care Act provides.   Americans deserve quality healthcare insurance that is accessible and  affordable.                            ____________________
