 Mr. President, first, let me thank the senior Senator  from New Jersey for those remarks. It was a privilege and a pleasure to  be here to hear them delivered. We had a hearing in the Judiciary  Committee this morning with a representative of Homeland Security who  was virtually incapable of explaining any of what they were trying to  do here. I think we now have five or six different explanations from  the Trump administration. One is, the Bible made me do it--the Attorney  General; the other is, the Democrats made me do it; the third is, we  are actually not doing it; the fourth is, we are doing it to build  legislative leverage; and the fifth is, we are doing it in order to  deter people from coming to our shores.   I doubt any of those are true, but, for sure, they can't all be true.  It is a mess, but it is nothing like the mess of the images the Senator  from New Jersey called to the conscience of the country today.    Of course. I am finished, until I go to my business  related to your bill.    First, let me thank Chairman Alexander for his  support and assistance in getting us to this point. He has also, until  I rotated off the HELP Committee and onto the Finance Committee, been  my chairman on the HELP Committee. Both in his work as the  appropriations subcommittee chair here managing this bill, I thank him,  and for all of his leadership on the HELP Committee when I was a member  of that committee, I thank him.   As the Senate looks at this measure, I want to try to explain it in  as simple terms as possible because I think this is a complete slam- dunk, win-win amendment. A next generation of nuclear power capability  is being developed, and a great deal of the design of that next- generation nuclear capability is being done here in the United States.   For a variety of reasons, those American designs are now moving to  approval and construction in other countries, particularly including  China. I don't think it is a good idea for us to be designing new  technologies but have them deployed in other countries. We are trying  to address some of the hiccups that prevent this from going forward in  the United States.   Our U.S. Navy uses nuclear fuel all the time. I think it is widely  known that our aircraft carriers and submarines operate with nuclear  engines. They do so very safely. They do so with the expert support of  our U.S. Navy. Then, at the end of the day, they generate spent fuel  that gets taken off of the aircraft carrier or the submarine when the  engine is refueled. The question is, What becomes of that spent fuel?    What this bill would do is to allow the Navy to give access to that  spent fuel to our National Labs. America's National Labs are a science  gem of global proportions. The scientists who work in our National Labs  are brilliant. They are extraordinary. They are at the cutting edge of  a great number of issues and developments. One of them is--guess what-- next-generation nuclear power. What access to the Navy's fuel would do  is to allow them, under the strict controls that are protecting our  National Labs, to begin to work through testing how some of these next- generation nuclear plants might work.   Why is it a big deal for us to look at developing in the United  States this next generation of nuclear power?   One obvious reason is that it is carbon-free power, and we have  already blown through 400 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the  atmosphere. That is way out of the range that we have been in the  entire history of humankind on this planet, and it will have all sorts  of cascading effects on our climate, our atmosphere, and our oceans.  Nuclear power avoids all of those ancillary risks of fossil fuel power.   The other problem is that we have been operating with old-school  nuclear power for quite a long time in this country, and we have built  up a very substantial reserve of nuclear waste, of spent fuel. At the  moment, the Senate and the Congress and, indeed, the U.S. Government  have no plan for getting rid of that nuclear waste. There have been  fights over sticking it in caves in Nevada. There have been all sorts  of ideas, but we do not currently have an operating plan. A great deal  of that nuclear waste is, simply, stored at the powerplant at which the  power was generated. That is a big liability, I believe.   I think that if we were to act as if we were a corporation and book  as a liability the liability of the cost of having to safely dispose of  all of that nuclear waste, it would get the companies' accountants'  attention, and they would invest some effort into figuring out what the  solution is to dealing with all of those stockpiles of nuclear waste  for which we currently have no plan.   Here is where the two lines converge, because the next-generation  nuclear technologies carry the promise of being able to take our  nuclear waste stockpile and repurpose it as fuel--to turn toxic,  dangerous, multi-10,000-year waste, with a huge liability attached to  it, into an asset, a power-producing asset.   To me, this is a very small investment in a potential solution to a  very big problem. I think we can have considerable confidence that the  U.S. Navy knows what it is doing in handling these nuclear fuels and  that our National Labs know what they are doing  [[Page S4031]]  in handling nuclear materials. The trust of the Navy and the trust of  the National Labs and the expertise of the National Labs, in their  giving us the ability to actually create a potential solution to at  least a significant part of our nuclear waste problem, is worth the  small investment that, I hope, my colleagues will be willing to make  today.   I particularly thank Senator Crapo, who has worked with me very  closely on this whole nuclear innovation side. He is a real leader in  this area. I am happy to be his Democratic colleague working on this. I  hope that with that explanation, we can come to a measure of agreement  that this is actually a good, ``no losers'' idea and be able to vote on  it tomorrow. I hope we will have a very strong and successful vote.   With all of that, I yield the floor to the floor manager from the  Republican side.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  up to 15 minutes as in morning business.    Thank you, Mr. President.                                Climate Change    Mr. President, as 2010 dawned, in what now seems like another era of  political time, the U.S. Congress was poised to tackle the problem of  climate change. The House of Representatives had just passed a cap-and- trade bill, and there was bipartisan support for climate action in the  Senate. Then, on January 21--a date that ought to live in judicial  infamy--five Justices on the U.S. Supreme Court--all Republican  appointees--delivered Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission  and unleashed unlimited special interest money into America's political  system.   The fossil fuel industry was looking for a way to stop climate  legislation; it got Citizens United. Fossil fuel interests asked those  Justices for, anticipated, and immediately seized on the political  opportunity Citizens United provided them.   Citizens United instantly changed the game in Congress for big  political interests, such as the fossil fuel industry. Before that  fateful day, Congress had held regular, bipartisan hearings and even  votes on legislation to limit the carbon emissions causing climate  change, but Citizens United allowed the fossil fuel industry to strike  at this bipartisan progress, and it struck hard. The fossil fuel  industry set its political forces instantly to work, targeting pro- climate-action candidates, particularly Republicans. Outside spending  in 2010's congressional races increased 75 percent--75 percent--by more  than $200 million over the previous midterm's levels.   Citizens United gave the fossil fuel political forces another power-- not just the power to spend but the power to threaten. As powerful a  cudgel as actual election spending is to wield, it is also powerful to  threaten to wield that cudgel. Threats are not only powerful, they are  less expensive than actual spending--you get to keep the money, and the  threats are likely to be secret.   The sudden barrage of unlimited money, dark money, and political  threat had its desired effect: The political hit men of the fossil fuel  industry stopped bipartisan climate action in its tracks. Pro-climate  Republicans had a choice: either stop advocating for climate action or  become a casualty.   The clear before-and-after point is 2010's Citizens United decision  and the immediate weaponization of that new power by the fossil fuel  industry to protect its polluting status quo--a status quo, by the way,  that the International Monetary Fund estimates provides fossil fuel a  subsidy of $700 billion--billion with a ``b''--every year, just in the  United States.   The Republican appointees who delivered the Citizens United decision  claimed that there would be a regime of ``effective disclosure'' that  would, as they said, ``provide shareholders and citizens with the  information needed to hold corporations and elected officials  accountable for their positions and supporters.'' Of course, this has  not happened. Instead, we have witnessed billionaires and corporate  interests spending unlimited secret money in elections. Outside groups  have already spent $140 million in the 2018 election cycle, nearly half  of which is from groups with no or only partial disclosure.   The head of the Koch brothers' dark money group, Americans for  Prosperity, announced that the Kochs' political network plans to spend  $400 million in the 2018 cycle--60 percent more than it spent in 2016.  Just last month, a single anonymous donor contributed $26.4 million to  the American Action Network, a dark-money organization with close ties  to Speaker Paul Ryan.   Secrecy is the key to the fossil fuel polluters' toxic control of our  democracy. Light will drive them back. As a Foreign Service officer's  son living overseas in impoverished tropical  [[Page S4032]]  countries, I remember that the cockroaches would come out at night.  When you would go into the kitchen to get a drink, you would hit the  light switch, the lights would flicker on, and you would see and hear  the cockroaches scuttling for the protection of the shadows, fleeing  the light.   Well, we need a little bit of that light in our democracy. So, with  my Democratic colleagues, I am reintroducing my legislation to bring  about the so-called ``effective disclosure,'' which even the Supreme  Court that decided Citizens United acknowledged is necessary for the  American people to have full faith in our political system.   The DISCLOSE Act of 2018 offers a commonsense solution to restore  transparency and accountability in our political system. The DISCLOSE  Act would rein in what has been called a ``tsunami of slime'' by  requiring organizations spending money in American elections--including  super PACs, unions, tax-exempt 501(c)(4) groups, all of them--to  promptly disclose donors who give $10,000 or more during an election  cycle. Big, sneaky donors will try to hide behind shell corporations  that disguise who they are, so the bill includes robust transfer  provisions to prevent dark-money operatives from using complex webs of  phony front groups to hide real donor identities.   The DISCLOSE Act also strengthens the ban forbidding election  spending by foreign nationals. One of the problems of our present dark- money infestation is that foreign actors can hide their political  influence activities in the exact same dark-money channels used by the  big special interests. Once you tolerate dark-money channels of  influence in American elections, you can't police who uses those dark- money channels. Anonymity is anonymity; anyone could be hiding in the  dark. Vladimir Putin could be hiding in the dark. We don't know until  we turn on the lights.   Last, the bill requires people spending money on election advertising  to ``stand by your ad'' so that the ad itself identifies who is behind  the advertising.   Can we get this done? The public certainly wants us to, and it wasn't  too long ago that Republicans supported disclosure. They were right  back then, but now Republicans, who once extolled the principles of  openness and accountability in our elections, have changed their tune.  Gone is their distaste for secretive election spending; indeed, a new  appetite for secret spending has emerged.   This is how the special interest rot of our democracy occurs: The big  special interests not only want to win in Congress, they want to change  the rules of democracy to make it so they can always win in Congress,  and they use those changed rules to make sure their party goes along  with it.   Back in 2014, the Rules Committee actually held a hearing on  DISCLOSE. I hope we can get another hearing because since that time,  the problem of dark money has only gotten worse. President Trump  promised to drain the swamp and then turned his administration over to  the biggest dark-money swamp monsters that exist. For example, nearly  two dozen dark-money organizations fronting for God knows who--but one  can guess--backed the nomination of Scott Pruitt to be the  Environmental Protection Agency Administrator. Indeed, Administrator  Pruitt himself raised millions of dollars in dark money while serving  as Oklahoma's attorney general, and he has never disclosed what  business those interests that funded him now have before the EPA.   Americans correctly feel that the tsunami of anonymous dark money  drowns out their voices in Washington and washes them to the margins of  our political arena. The DISCLOSE Act of 2018 offers a commonsense  solution to restore transparency and accountability into our political  system. With the Senate now in session through most of the summer,  there is ample time for this body to examine the merits of clearing  dark money out of our political system. The problem of dark-money  spending and threats is too big to ignore.   This is why we are failing at addressing climate change. The  corruption and fear Citizens United set loose in our politics in 2010  sickeningly empowered big special interests, and to the lasting shame  of our Nation, it allowed the fossil fuel industry to purchase veto  power over our national policymaking on climate change. We have allowed  the biggest interest with the biggest conflict of interest to acquire  veto power over what the Congress of the United States does on this  vital issue.   This has been a double evil: It has been poisonous to the American  democracy we cherish, and by preventing action to address climate  change, it is poisonous to our entire planet.   By introducing this legislation, we are giving our Republican  colleagues a chance to show the American people where they stand--with  the individual voters we were all sent here to represent, who massively  want there to be climate action, or with the billionaires and corporate  interests pursuing a quiet, hostile takeover of American democracy  using dark money and threats.   The cockroaches are everywhere. I say, let's turn on the lights.   I yield the floor.
