 Madam President, I urge the Senate to approve the  Further Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018.   This legislation is more than a continuing resolution to sustain  government operations at current levels through March 23.   It incorporates a 2-year agreement setting defense and nondefense  spending levels for fiscal years 2018 and 2019, the product of  bipartisan and bicameral negotiations. This overdue agreement is  necessary for Congress to meet its responsibility to provide  appropriations to meet national security and other important needs  around the country.   This deal gives my committee a real opportunity to complete the  fiscal year 2018 appropriations process with significant funding to  begin rebuilding our military and address national priorities like  veterans, infrastructure, and the opioid epidemic.   This measure also provides necessary emergency funding to help  victims of recent hurricanes, wildfires, and other disasters to rebuild  their lives and communities.   I appreciate the many hours of negotiations that have gone into this  legislation. The cotton and dairy provisions are the outcome of months  of joint efforts with my friend, Vice Chairman Leahy, to help cotton  and dairy producers overcome economic hardships that threaten their  livelihoods.   I hope we continue in this cooperative and bipartisan fashion as we  undertake the challenging work of crafting responsible legislation to  finish the 2018 appropriations cycle and begin work on next year's  bills.
