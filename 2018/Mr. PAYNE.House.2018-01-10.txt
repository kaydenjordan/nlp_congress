 Mr. Speaker, Congress must stop deferring the American  Dream for bright young people simply because they were brought here as  children.   DACA recipients represent the best of our Nation. These are young  people who are in school, got their education, or served in our Armed  Forces. These are people who never committed a felony offense or  significant misdemeanor. These are people who pose no threat to public  safety. These are people who just want to live the American Dream, and  each day that passes without Congress voting on the Dream Act darkens  their futures.   Mr. Speaker, if it is numbers my esteemed colleagues on the other  side of the aisle want, I have got them. Deporting DACA recipients  would cost the U.S. economy $400 billion. Deporting the 5,300 eligible  people for DACA in my district alone would cost the economy $140  million.   Aren't we supposed to be growing the economy, not shrinking it?                            ____________________
