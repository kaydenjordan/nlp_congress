 Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for his  remarks. I do appreciate the encouragement he has given both Senator  Shelby and me in getting the appropriations bills through. He has been  here long enough. He knows this is the way the Senate should work. We  have done it in a bipartisan way, and we are way ahead of where we have  been at any time in the past 2 years.   I also want to applaud the senior Senator from Maine. She sits on the  Appropriations Committee. We have served together there throughout our  careers, and she is a valuable member of that committee. She is one who  has helped put together, with her Democratic counterpart, good  legislation that is included. In fact, there was nearly a unanimous  vote in the Appropriations Committee. Most of this has been either  unanimous or virtually unanimous. I say that because some have felt  that, in the Senate lately, you could not get a majority vote even to  say the Sun rises in the East. But here we have been doing majority  votes on things that involve everywhere from Alaska to Vermont. I am  pleased with it.                        Nomination of Brett Kavanaugh    Mr. President, I take the floor in my role as vice chairman of  Appropriations in managing this bill, but I am going to digress, as  others have, for a few minutes and speak about something else.   We are now less than 2 weeks away from Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation  hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. We are 2 weeks away, and  according to the National Archives, the committee has received only 6  percent of his total White House records. This is virtually  unprecedented--6 percent of his records and not a single one of the  records we have received has been provided by the National Archives.  That is because the Archives will not complete its review of the  limited number of records requested by Chairman Grassley until October,  which is a month after the majority leader intends to hold a final vote  on Judge Kavanaugh.    Actually, to date, every single record that we have received from the  Judiciary Committee has been hand selected by a political lawyer  representing President George W. Bush. He is a partisan lawyer who  reported directly to Judge Kavanaugh in the Bush White House, a lawyer  who also represents White House Counsel Don McGahn, Steve Bannon, and  Reince Priebus in the Russia investigation. I mention this because he  has been very selective in the very few things we have been allowed to  see.   I mention this because this is in stark contrast to past precedent.  Let me talk about the vetting of Justice Kagan, who, like Judge  Kavanaugh, had served in the White House prior to her nomination. I was  chairman of the Judiciary Committee at that time. I worked hand in hand  with then-Ranking Member Jeff Sessions to ensure that we received every  document of interest to the committee. Certainly, on behalf of the  Republicans, Senator Sessions demanded an awful lot of records, and I  worked with him to get them. In fact, when we were 12 days away from  Justice Kagan's hearing, we had already received a full 99 percent of  her White House records--99 percent.   I mention that because now, at the same time with Judge Kavanaugh, we  are at 6 percent. The Republicans have allowed 6 percent, and the  Democrats allowed 99 percent. Does this make the confirmation hearing a  partisan joke?   In fact, every single one of Justice Kagan's records was provided by  the nonpartisan National Archives. The 6 percent of Judge Kavanaugh's  records has been provided by a political, partisan, hyperconflicted  attorney. I mean that just on the face of it, it does not pass the  giggle test. The Democrats provided from the nonpartisan National  Archives 99 percent of Justice Kagan's records. Here we are getting  only 6 percent of Judge Kavanaugh's records, and they have been picked  by a political, partisan attorney with hyperconflicts.   The superficial vetting of Judge Kavanaugh is all the more troubling  because there are still serious concerns about the last time he  testified before the Senate. During his 2006 nomination hearing for the  DC Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Kavanaugh minimized his work on  highly controversial issues in the Bush White House, including on  detainee treatment and warrantless wiretapping. It is now clear that we  will only know the full truth if we get his full record. With anything  less, we will be, simply, rushing to a verdict before the trial.   Based on the very limited documents they have allowed us to see,  there is an additional reason to be concerned. The committee has  received new evidence that sheds light on whether Judge Kavanaugh was  truthful while under oath in 2006. Unfortunately, I cannot even  describe these documents because they have kept them in a classified or  confidential forum, and the American people cannot see them. That is  because nearly two-thirds of the documents the Judiciary Committee has  received have been designated as ``committee confidential'' by Chairman  Grassley, following the request of the partisan attorney on whom the  Senate is relying to do the job of the nonpartisan National Archives.  To date, that means that two percent of Judge Kavanaugh's White House  records have been made available to the American people--2 percent-- compared to 99 percent for Justice Kagan, and they have selected what  that 2 percent is. Golly, what is in the other 98 percent they don't  want us to see?   I have served in this body for 44 years. I have been here for every  Supreme Court nomination since John Paul Stevens. I have voted for a  lot of Republicans and Democrats on the Supreme Court. For 20 years, I  served as the chairman or as the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary  Committee. In those 44 years, I can tell you, frankly, that the vetting  of Judge Kavanaugh has been the most incomplete, most partisan, and  least transparent of any Supreme Court nominee I have ever seen of  either a Democratic or a Republican President. It has not been even  close. I have taken the experience I have had here with Democrats and  Republicans as President. In 44 years, I have never seen such  incomplete, partisan, or nontransparent vetting.   Yesterday, I met with Judge Kavanaugh--a very pleasant man. I had the  opportunity to ask him about many issues, including about his work in  the Bush White House. Following our meeting, I believe even more  strongly that the documents he authored or contributed to during his 3  years as White House Staff Secretary should be released and made public  now. What he wrote is far more important than what his personality  might be. Let's find out what he wrote. That will tell us what kind of  a Supreme Court Justice he would be apt to be.   A vigilant review of the Supreme Court nominee's full record isn't an  optional matter. It shouldn't be dependent upon which party controls  the White House or the Senate. Again, in 44 years, I have seen very  vigilant reviews of Supreme Court nominees by both Republicans and  Democrats. That is the way it should be, and I have agreed with that  every single time. Yet never, never have I seen something like this.  Never, never have I seen one's record hidden the way this one has been.  It is undeniable that documents of clear public interest are being  hidden from the American people--documents that will shed light on both  his views and on his fitness to serve on our Nation's highest Court.   Wearing blinders in this moment is fundamentally incompatible with  our constitutional obligation to provide advice and informed consent.  The Senate is supposed to be the conscience of the Nation. It is a sad  conscience.   The Federal judiciary stands alone. Unlike in any other branch of our  government, the Justices, for good reason, never face the scrutiny of  the electorate. Once a Supreme Court Justice is confirmed, he or she  will serve for life. Barring impeachment, which has happened just once  in our Nation's history, they essentially serve with no oversight.   The Senate has no second chance when it comes to vetting a nominee.  We have to get this right. We can't have a vote now and 2 months from  now get the records and say: Oh, golly gee, if we had known this, we  would have voted differently.   We have to have all of the records now and then vote. There is time  to do so. The Senate should not be focused on getting Judge Kavanaugh  confirmed by October 1--some artificial deadline. Instead, the Senate  should be focused  [[Page S5797]]  on doing its job. That requires allowing the National Archives to  complete its review of Judge Kavanaugh's record as required by the  Presidential Records Act.   At a time when the President is facing unprecedented legal jeopardy,  it would be an extraordinary disservice to the American people to break  all precedence and confirm his selection to the Supreme Court without  there being an actual review.   Have the review. Then, every Senator--he or she--can make up his mind  on how he is going to vote. Don't vote blindly without having all of  the material. The fact that Judge Kavanaugh has a longer record than  prior Supreme Court nominees--something the President was keenly aware  of when he selected him--does not excuse the Senate from doing its job,  because, if confirmed, he is going to shape the lives of all Americans  for generations to come.   If, when the National Archives completes its review in October we  learn that we did not get it right, it will fall squarely on the  shoulders of this body. If the Senators rush this and find out later  that there was material there they should have seen, they will have  absolutely no excuse whatsoever because they will have concurred in the  rushing. We should set this partisan vetting aside. We should work  together, as we have in the past, to actually vet Judge Kavanaugh's  record in a way that honors our constitutional obligation--the job the  American people sent us here to do.   I feel honored to be here as a U.S. Senator from the State of  Vermont. I do strongly believe, as I did when I first came here, that  this body can be the conscience of the Nation. We aren't following our  conscience if we don't do the real work to find out what we are voting  on. We have voted on a lot of things. Some have been routine. This is  not. This is to vote for a person who will serve on the U.S. Supreme  Court long after most of us will have left this body. We owe it to all  Americans--I don't care what their politics are or where they are  from--to get it right. That is what our oath calls for. That is why we  are here.   I have voted more than all but three or four people in the history of  this country. Every time I vote, I am hoping I am doing it right, and I  try to do it in an informed way.   I know we are going to go back now to the appropriations bills, but  here is a case in which I think we have done things right. Senator  Shelby is the chairman, and I am the vice chairman. It is one of only  three committees that has a vice chairman. We have worked very closely  together, and we have done it in a way to get bills through in a  bipartisan fashion. We actually work the way the Senate did when I  first came here, which is the way the Senate has worked under great  leaders on the Democratic side, like Mike Mansfield, or on the  Republican side, like Howard Baker, and we have gotten things done.   I am proud of the Appropriations Committee, but I am concerned about  the Judiciary Committee. I have had the privilege of serving on it for  over 40 years and have had the privilege of being chairman and ranking  member. Yet I have to say that it is not doing its job if it is not  requiring all of the material to be here. On the Appropriations  Committee, Senator Shelby and I work to make sure that everybody is  heard and everybody has the material. We should be doing the same thing  on the Judiciary Committee.   I see the chairman of the committee is on the floor, and I have  spoken on the matter on which I wanted to speak.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, there have been a number of headline- grabbing days during the first 18 months of the Trump administration,  and I think yesterday is going to rank among the  [[Page S5807]]  most extraordinary. But for this Senator from Vermont, it has been the  most troubling.   The President of the United States was effectively identified by his  long-time lawyer and confidant as an unindicted co-conspirator in their  efforts to commit criminal campaign finance violations. If what they  are saying is true, what his confidant is pleading guilty to is that  then-Candidate Trump arranged payments to two women he had affairs  with, in violation of Federal law, in order to keep those affairs  hidden from the American people at a most critical time, days before  the election.   Further, last night, the lawyer for Mr. Cohen claimed that his client  also has information relevant to whether President Trump had advance  knowledge--and even supported--the hacking of Democratic electronic  files. We know that he gave a speech at one point saying that if Russia  is listening, they should hack. That crime, which we know was committed  at the direction of Russian President Vladimir Putin, serves as a basis  for Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.   Also yesterday, within minutes of Mr. Cohen's entering his guilty  plea, a jury found the President's former campaign manager guilty of  numerous tax and bank fraud charges. Paul Manafort will now face a  separate trial concerning his work for a Putin-connected oligarch both  in Ukraine and here at home. In this second trial, scheduled to begin  next month, Mr. Manafort has been charged with conspiracy to defraud  the United States, failing to register as a foreign agent, and money  laundering, among other charges.   The clouds of criminal conduct surrounding those close to the  President are darkening. Directly or indirectly, his campaign manager,  personal attorney, and multiple aides have now been swept up in the  Special Counsel's investigation. This probe has resulted in numerous  guilty pleas and 34 criminal indictments. And it is not complete.   I have watched, both as a Senator and as a former prosecutor, and it  is so troubling. I know one thing; it is crucial that the special  counsel be permitted to complete his investigation and to do so without  the daily--often hourly--interference from the President. During my  four decades in the Senate, I have never before seen an investigation  led by career, apolitical law enforcement officials so personally and  publicly maligned by a politician--let alone by the President of the  United States. No one is above the law, and the President should stop  acting as though he is.   I would also urge the Majority Leader to immediately bring the  bipartisan legislation to protect the Special Counsel to the Floor. We  passed this legislation out of the Senate Judiciary Committee with a  bipartisan vote. Anyone who says that the President can be trusted not  to undermine the Special Counsel has clearly not been paying attention.  Think of all of the tweets he sent as the Manafort trial was going on.  Do you think those weren't seen directly or indirectly by those  involved in the trial? We know that the judge made clear his opposition  to the prosecution, and the jury also had to listen to the President's  tweets. Just think of what that does.    It is equally critical that the Senate reassert its oversight  responsibility over the Executive Branch--something for which we have  advocated. If these were normal times, the Senate Judiciary Committee  would immediately pursue an investigation.   Indeed, the Judiciary Committee is uniquely situated to investigate  the allegation raised by Mr. Cohen. The Committee has jurisdiction over  our criminal laws, including our campaign finance laws. Mr. Cohen's  lawyer has indicated that he is willing to testify before Congress  without being granted immunity--pretty extraordinary.   It is difficult to reconcile the Judiciary Committee's inaction here  with one of the most critical constitutional crises we have seen-- certainly since I have been in the Senate, and I have been here for 44  years.   It is difficult to reconcile the Judiciary Committee's inaction with  its race to confirm President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court. In  fact, the timeline the Republicans are pursuing to consider Judge  Kavanaugh is so aggressive that it will sideline the nonpartisan review  of the nominee's record performed by the National Archives. That has  occurred for every Supreme Court nominee since Watergate, whether  Republican or Democratic.   I mentioned earlier today that when I was chairman, Justice Kagan was  up, and the Republicans asked for her records. We got 99 percent of  them. I went to the Archives. I joined with the senior Republican, Jeff  Sessions, on the Committee to request them. We got 99 percent of those  records before the hearing. We have 6 percent of Judge Kavanaugh's  records. And those were handpicked by a lawyer whose clients include,  among others, Stephen Bannon and other very partisan clients.   The Russia investigation is the most pressing national security  investigation of our time. Here we have a powerful country--Russia-- that is working against us. We know it. We can just pick up the paper.  Without going to any of the classified hearings that most of us have  been to, we can read what is in the paper about the hacking Russia has  done and the billions of dollars it has cost people and the hacking  that continues to this moment against the United States. This is the  Russia that the President publicly called upon during a campaign rally  to hack his opponent's computers. We know from what we have seen and  what our intelligence community has told us that they did try to  influence the last election, and we do know they intend to try to  influence the elections this year, not only in our country but in other  countries. This is a major problem, and it is being ignored.   I think history is going to judge all of us in the U.S. Senate very  harshly if we collectively shrug our shoulders and disregard our  constitutional responsibility to oversee the Executive Branch in this  moment. We represent a coequal branch of government. It is time to act  like it.   Mr. President, I was going to suggest the absence of a quorum, but I  see one of my distinguished colleagues on the floor, so I will simply  yield the floor.    Mr. President, when Justice Kagan was up for nomination, I  was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I, along with then  Ranking Member Jeff Sessions, sent a letter saying that we needed all  of her White House records. We received 99 percent of those records.   Now for Judge Kavanaugh's nomination we are told, after being  carefully selected, that we can only have 3 percent of his records. It  is an interesting standard. Republicans want all of it when there is a  Democratic President, for a woman who was nominated by a Democrat. Now,  when the Republicans nominate this man, they say: We will selectively  give you 3 percent. It is an interesting double standard. It makes me  wonder what there is to hide in there. Why not take the time to see it  all?   If I am going to vote on a lifetime appointment--I voted for a lot of  Republican nominees for the Supreme Court and other courts--I want to  see the whole record. I don't want, a month after I voted, more to come  out in the record and to think: Whoops, who knew about that? We had  this happen with one judge already after they were confirmed to a  lifetime appointment. The final records came out, and we found out what  they did with issues of torture and other things. It was bad.                   Amendment No. 3993 to Amendment No. 3699    Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask unanimous  consent that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, earlier I talked about what has happened on  the Manafort and Cohen matters yesterday. I understand the great amount  of consternation there is at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.  Having been a prosecutor, I can understand why there is consternation.   I note for my colleagues that we passed in the Senate Judiciary  Committee a bipartisan bill--Republican and Democrats voted for the  bill--to protect the special prosecutor. There  [[Page S5815]]  are those of us who are old enough to remember when Richard Nixon fired  the special prosecutor in the Watergate matter and the great  constitutional problems that followed. It was something the country  suffered over for years, and we want to make sure we don't have another  firing like we did in the Watergate matter. So we wrote this bill.  Again, Republicans and Democrats voted for it. It could be brought up  anytime by the leadership, if they wished. I am hoping that it will be  brought up. I am hoping we can bring it to the floor and we can have a  vote. I know we had a good debate--again, Republicans and Democrats--in  the Judiciary Committee, and I would like to see it voted on.    I notice we are at the hour of 3:30, and I know the Presiding Officer  has a ruling to make, so I will withhold.                            ____________________     Mr. President, several of the warring parties in the South  Sudanese civil war, including President Kiir and the leader of the main  opposition party, Riek Machar, recently signed a power-sharing deal to  ostensibly bring to an end a conflict that has resulted in hundreds of  thousands of deaths and the largest refugee crisis in Africa. Today in  South Sudan, there are nearly 200,000 people sheltering at UN  peacekeeping bases, 4.5 million people have been forcibly displaced,  and an estimated 7 million people are in need of humanitarian aid.  Several ceasefires have been negotiated and broken by both sides since  the conflict began in December 2013, and the United States has invested  well over $3 billion in humanitarian aid to help the people of South  Sudan who have been largely abandoned by their political leaders.   Unfortunately, the viability of the recent power-sharing deal and the  prospects for a broader peace agreement remain in question. What we do  know is that decades of corruption, marginalization, political  manipulation, and human rights atrocities led to the most recent  iteration of catastrophic violence in South Sudan, and it will take  decades for the country to fully recover, but there is at least one  action that President Kiir should take today that would have immediate  benefits: the release of all political prisoners, journalists,  academics, and others who have been detained as a result of peacefully  exercising their right to free expression.   One such individual is Peter Biar Ajak. Mr. Ajak was resettled in  Philadelphia in January 2001 as a teenage refugee of the Sudanese civil  war and one of the 40,000 ``Lost Boys'' left homeless by that conflict.  Remarkably, he went on to earn a master's degree from Harvard and is  now a doctoral candidate at Cambridge. Mr. Ajak has been a courageous  and vocal critic of the failed peace process in South Sudan,  particularly the role of President Kiir and opposition leader Machar,  who for years have put amassing wealth and power for themselves far  above the welfare and rights of the South Sudanese people. It is this  criticism that his supporters believe led to his arrest and  imprisonment on July 28 by the South Sudan National Security Service,  NSS.   While the charges against him have not been publicly confirmed, Mr.  Ajak  [[Page S5826]]  is allegedly being charged with treason and other crimes against the  state and has reportedly been denied access to a lawyer. Reports  suggest he is one of several dozen detainees being held by the NSS at  the infamous Blue House prison in Juba.   Mr. Ajak's detention is consistent with a pattern of abuses by the  NSS, which has been implicated in the arbitrary arrest and detention of  journalists, national staff of the United Nations, academics, civil  society activists, and young business leaders like Kerbino Wol; the  forced disappearance of human rights lawyers and members of the  political opposition, such as Dong Samuel Luak and Aggrey Idri,  respectively; and other human rights violations and denials of due  process. Although President Kiir has previously announced that he would  release all political prisoners and his government has committed under  a recent deal to release detainees, human rights monitors continue to  report that dozens of people remain detained without charge at the Blue  House and other detention sites in the capital.   No matter what documents are signed to move the country beyond its  civil war, true peace and stability will not be achieved if the  government continues to repress free speech and arrest, detain, and  forcibly disappear journalists, politicians, academics, and members of  civil society. If and when the U.S. government is again called on to  support the government of South Sudan and to help rebuild its security  services, their actions in this conflict--and their treatment of people  like Peter Biar Ajak--will not be forgotten. I urge all Senators to  join me in calling for the immediate release of Mr. Ajak and other  prisoners of conscience and accountability for the perpetrators of such  abuses.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on behalf of all Vermonters, I want to  honor Clara Ayer of East Montpelier, VT, who will this month be  inducted into the Vermont Agricultural Hall of Fame, in recognition of  her status as an emerging leader in the Vermont agriculture community.  Clara is a proud 2010 alumna of Cornell University with a degree dairy  science who, after graduation, went to work for Yankee Farm Credit. She  began working full time at Fairmount Farm, a third-generation dairy  farm, alongside her brother Ricky in 2014. Clara is married to Dana  Ayer, and the couple has a little boy, Carson. She is a well-respected  advocate for agriculture, both in Montpelier and Washington, DC.   In addition to her membership in several dairy-related organizations,  Clara also promotes dairy to young people, through a ``Life on the  Farm'' summer camp, through educational field trips by the local  elementary school, and through the formation of a Dairy 4-H Club. As  Clara has provided exceptional service to the Vermont dairy community,  further described in her well-deserved nomination to the Vermont  Agricultural Hall of Fame, I ask unanimous consent that the citation of  her nomination be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Vermont Agricultural Hall of Fame 2018 Inductee Clara Ayer         Clara is a third-generation dairy farmer and family farm       advocate. She works alongside her family at Fairmount Farm,       where she wears many hats from overseeing human resources for       their staff of fifty employees, to bookkeeping, to marketing,       and events management. She plays an active role in shaping       agricultural policy through her advocacy at the Vermont       Statehouse, and in Washington D.C. as part of her work as an       Agri-Mark Young Cooperator and member of the National Milk       Producers' Federation. She currently serves as the secretary       of the Vermont Holstein Association, and is a delegate of       both Vermont and New England Dairy Promotion. Clara also       created and manages a ``Life on the Farm'' summer camp for       youth, which offers kids the opportunity to experience       agriculture through fun, educational on-farm activities.       Clara graduated from Cornell University in 2010 with a B.A.       in Dairy Science. She and her husband Dana are excited to be       raising their two-year-old son, Carson, on the family farm.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on behalf of all Vermonters, I would like  to honor Bob Foster of Middlebury, VT, who this month will be inducted  into the Vermont Agricultural Hall of Fame in recognition of more than  30 years of outstanding service to Vermont agriculture. For as long as  I have served in this body and especially in my work on the U.S. Senate  Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, I have often looked  to Bob for input and advice. In addition being a partner in an iconic  fifth-generation Vermont dairy, Bob's leadership in Vermont has been  extraordinary. During his 37 years of service on the Agri-Mark Dairy  Cooperative Board, the co-op has become a critical resource for many  Vermont dairy farms and a mainstay of the Vermont economy. Bob is an  innovator, taking risks and leading the way in Vermont for bio- digesters and sustainable value-added products and working nationally  on renewable energy as an adviser to the 25X25 effort. The extent of  his service on local, State, and national leadership teams is  exceptional and is further described in his well-deserved nomination to  the Vermont Agricultural Hall of Fame, I ask unanimous consent that the  nomination be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   Vermont Agricultural Hall of Fame Lifetime Achievement: 30+ Years of   Outstanding Service to Vermont Agriculture. Robert Foster, Middlebury         Robert is a partner in Foster Brothers Farm, a fifth-      generation dairy, who served on the Agrimark Board of       Directors for 37 consecutive years, before retiring in 2015.       He also chairs the University of Vermont, College of       Agriculture and Life Sciences' Board of Advisors.       Sustainability has always been one of Robert's passions.       Foster Brothers Farm was the first in the state to install       and operate a methane digester. Robert is also co-owner and       operator of Vermont Natural Ag Products, a sustainable       business which supplies wholesale products, formulated from       cow, horse and poultry compost, to the horticultural,       agricultural, and turf industries. He currently serves on the       Board of Directors for The Soil Health Institute. Within the       Agrimark Co-op, Robert has been a champion for renewable       energy and sustainability, helping to pioneer the Vital       Capital Index, which helps member farms measure and manage       their impact on their community, the environment and their       bottom line. He has been a tireless advocate for Vermont       agriculture, and a mentor and leader to young farmers, over       the course of his prestigious career. Together with his wife,       Nancy, he has three grown daughters; Robin Cole, Jennifer       Foster, and Heather Foster-Provencher, and six grandchildren.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on behalf of all Vermonters, I want to  honor Beth Kennett of Rochester, VT, who this month will be inducted  into the Vermont Agricultural Hall of Fame in recognition of her  multifaceted leadership of agriculture in the Green Mountain State.  Beth, with her husband, Bob, and their family, have for many years run  a multigenerational diversified dairy farm in the White River Valley. I  have often looked to Beth for her advice and insights into Vermont  agriculture. She has been a strong leader on many fronts, including  serving on the USDA Farm Service Agency State Committee, as founding  member of the Connecticut River Watershed Farmers Alliance, as founding  member of the White River Partnership, and especially as a leader in  agritourism in Vermont, nationally and internationally.   Beth's induction into the Vermont Agricultural Hall of Fame is well  earned, and I ask unanimous consent that her nomination for this honor  be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:          Vermont Agricultural Hall of Fame Inductee Beth Kennett         Beth is a dairy farmer and innkeeper who helped forge the       path for Vermont's agri-tourism industry. For more than 30       years, she has helped educate Vermont farmers, government       officials, and the public about the economic, social, and       educational benefits of agri-tourism. As the former president       of Vermont Farms!, she has traveled and spoken both       nationally and internationally to build awareness for agri-      tourism and create new opportunities for Vermont farmers. Her       tireless outreach and desire to educate has enabled many       farms to diversify and realize the economic advantages of       connecting directly with the public. Since 1984, Beth, her       husband Bob, and three generations of her family have opened       their home for farm stays, providing educational, hands-on       vacations for thousands of domestic and international guests.  [[Page S5827]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, it is my honor to recognize a true friend  of Vermont, State Senator Dick Sears of Bennington, who has been named  by FiscalNote as the sixth most productive State senator in the United  States.   Senator Sears, who was first elected in 1992, and as cited by  FiscalNote, has sponsored 314 bills and has a 60 percent bill passage  success rate. This recognition of Senator Sears' effectiveness comes as  no surprise in Vermont, where he is respected and is a fixture on the  nightly news during the legislative session.   In the Vermont Senate Judiciary Committee, where Senator Sears serves  as chair, he has acted courageously on issues including civil rights,  marriage equality, human trafficking, and adoption. He himself  highlights his work on corrections and criminal justice reform, as well  as his successful involvement in the 2010 rewrite of sex offender laws,  as major accomplishments; yet he also attributes his success in these  important issue areas to teamwork.   In addition to chairing the judiciary committee, Senator Sears also  serves on the appropriations committee, the joint fiscal committee, is  vice chair of the joint legislative child protection oversight  committee, is vice chair of the joint legislative justice committee,  and is a member of the legislative committee on judicial rules and the  legislative council committee.   Clearly, Senator Sears is a legislator who deserves recognition, yet  doesn't seek recognition. In honor of Senator Sears' outstanding  accomplishments, I ask that the article by Christie Wisniewski from the  July 31 edition of the Bennington Banner, ``Sears ranked 6th in  productivity for U.S. state senators,'' be printed into the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      Bennington Banner, July 31, 2018           Sears ranked 6th in productivity for U.S. state senators         This story by Christie Wisniewski was published by the       Bennington Banner on July 31.        Bennington.--State Sen. Dick Sears of Bennington is the       sixth most productive state senator in the United States,       according to an analysis released Monday by a Washington,       D.C.-based software startup. Each year, FiscalNote creates a       list of the top 10 state senators using ``unique data       analytics software,'' the company said in a press release.       The list ranks all senators and representatives in accordance       with their legislative productivity, which is defined as how       successful the legislator is at sponsoring and steering bills       through each stage of the legislative process.        This research also ranks the quality, endurance and       substantiveness of the bills each legislator sponsored and       introduced. For example, legislators score higher if they       sponsor a higher number of bills and if their bills make it       further in the legislative process. A bill that is enacted is       weighted more than a bill that does not make it past the       Senate floor. Finally, legislators score higher if their       bills are substantive a bill that attempts meaningful change       rather than a memorial or commendation.        Sears, a Democrat, was first elected in 1992. Since then,       he has sponsored 314 bills and has a 60-percent bill passage       success rate.        ``I'm just flabbergasted,'' Sears said of the report.       ``[I'm] really humbled and pleased, quite frankly.''        Sears was the only state senator from New England to make       the top 10.        State Sen. Brian Campion, who is running for re-election       alongside his district mate Sears as a team, lauded Sears for       his dedication to the county.        ``Bennington County was once the forgotten kingdom of       Vermont, but Dick has helped us rid ourselves of that       title,'' Campion said. ``He's incredibly hard working, and       I'm lucky to have him as a mentor and district mate.''        According to the National Conference of State Legislatures       website, there are 7,383 legislators across the United       States.        ``To be ranked in the top 10 of state senators is an       amazing thing,'' Sears said. ``. . . I've worked well with       various administrations over the years and sponsored some       really tough bills.''        Sears has worked successfully with four different Vermont       governors and sponsored bills dealing with civil rights,       marriage equality, human trafficking, adoption, and other       issues. He views his work with reforming state corrections       and criminal justice laws--especially with juvenile justice--      as a ``major accomplishment'' and also sees his involvement       with the 2010 ``complete rewrite'' of sex offender laws as a       success.        However, Sears doesn't want to take all the credit for the       bills that have passed under his watch.        ``Like anything else, you never do it alone,'' he said.        Rep. Timothy R. Corcoran II of Bennington also believes       Sears' recognition is well-deserved.        ``Dick has always lived by his convictions and never backed       down when he faced opposition to issues that weren't       universally accepted,'' Corcoran said. ``Bennington County       has been extremely lucky to have him represent us up in       Montpelier.''        Corcoran commended Sears' willingness to fight for       Bennington County, ``whether it's been PFOA, helping to       secure Amtrak bus service funding, fighting for the Vermont       Veterans Home, or just securing funds for Bennington County       in general.''        ``Dick has always stepped up to the plate and delivered,''       Corcoran added. ``Congratulations Dick; job well done.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, on behalf of all Vermonters, I would like  to honor Enid Wonnacott of Huntington, VT, who this month will be  inducted into the Vermont Agricultural Hall of Fame in recognition of  her more than 30 years of agricultural leadership in Vermont and the  Nation. Enid became the executive director of the Northeast Organic  Farming Association of Vermont, NOFA-VT, in 1987, the same year that I  became chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition,  and Forestry. Enid has been a national leader in advancing the  importance of organic agriculture. She provided important technical and  advocacy support as I worked on the National Organic Standards Act as  part of the 1990 farm bill--which has in turn resulted in making  organic agriculture a $60 billion annual industry--with Vermont as a  leader. Thirty years later, Enid continues to provide advice on organic  agriculture and nutrition issues.   Enid Wonnacott's many accomplishments are presented in detail in her  much deserved nomination to the Vermont Agricultural Hall of Fame.   I ask unanimous consent to have the nomination printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       Vermont Agricultural Hall of Fame 2018 Inductee Enid Wonnacott         Enid has served as the Executive Director of The Northeast       Organic Farming Association of Vermont (NOFA-VT) since 1987.       Over the course of her tenure, thanks to her leadership,       Vermont's organic industry has grown immensely, from just 57       certified farms in 1990, to more than 700, today. Enid has       worked tirelessly to help ensure all Vermonters have access       to local, organic foods, and began a pioneering farm share       program more than 20 years ago to provide subsidized farm       shares for low-income Vermonters. As the National Organic       Program was developed, Enid worked to implement a national       certification program that kept the needs of Vermont's family       farms at the forefront. Over the past three decades, she has       nurtured and guided more than 70 staff and 20 interns,       secured consistent grant and donor funding, and led NOFA-VT       to become a national leader in organic advocacy, food access,       and farm to school education. She has made an indelible mark       on both the local, and national, organic movement. Enid grew       up in Weybridge, and has lived on a small farmstead in       Huntington with her husband, Harry, and children, Lila and       Eli, for the past thirty years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, an unrelenting government crackdown on the  women's rights movement is taking place in Saudi Arabia. This is the  subject of a Senate resolution, of which I am an original cosponsor,  introduced today by Senator Merkley.   It is widely known that Saudi Arabia has a long history of  subjugating and discriminating against women and girls. Today, despite  talk of reform, Saudi authorities continue to arbitrarily arrest and  detail women's rights activists and supporters, including Samar Badawi,  recipient of the 2012 International Women of Courage Award; Nassima al- Sadah, an Eastern Province activist, and Nouf Abdelaziz, an activist  and writer, among others.   The latest crackdown, which began in May, has resulted in the arrest  of more than a dozen women's rights activists, with many more also  barred from traveling abroad.   Many people erroneously equate the recent lifting of the ban on  female drivers in Saudi Arabia as indicative of increased government  support for women's rights in the country. To the contrary, the  government has arrested some of the same women activists who campaigned  for the right to drive only a short time ago.   We and others often deplore the arbitrary arrests, denial of  fundamental rights and liberties, and execution of prisoners in Iran  for ``crimes'' that would be protected speech under international law;  yet, we see similar abuses in Saudi Arabia and the systematic  persecution of women by Saudi authorities without a commensurate level  of international outcry.   Arbitrary arrests of peaceful activists, regardless of cause or  country, is not acceptable. Freedom of speech and peaceful dissent are  critical underpinnings of human rights activism around the globe and  must be consistently defended. Women's rights are human rights.   I urge all Senators to stand up against attacks of fundamental rights  and liberties, in all countries and for all people, including those  fighting for the rights of women in Saudi Arabia.                            ____________________
