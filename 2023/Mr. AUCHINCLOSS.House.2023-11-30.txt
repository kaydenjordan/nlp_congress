 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida for  her leadership on this issue.   I rise today to tell the story of Ofer Kalderon. On October 7, the  deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust, Ofer, along  with his children Sahar, 16, and Erez, 12, was taken  [[Page H6042]]  hostage by Hamas from the Nir Oz Kibbutz close to the Gaza Strip.   During that brutal attack, 29 of Kibbutz Nir Oz's 400 residents were  murdered, and 80 were taken captive. These are not just numbers. Those  residents who were murdered were individuals with hopes now  extinguished, with lives now cut short.   Those taken hostage are living in unimaginable terror, and their  families are waiting, hoping for good news and fearing the worst.   Ofer is a father of four, a carpenter. He loves to build and to  rebuild engines, to travel, to take family camping trips, to race and  ride dirt bikes, to help cook Shabbat dinner for his family.   When asked about Ofer, his family describes his easygoing energy and  a huge smile.   We cannot lose sight of the fact that there is a family and a story  like this one behind each one of these names of those murdered and of  those taken hostage. Ofer is one of them.   Ofer's children have thankfully been returned, but their family will  not be made whole again until Ofer is released, as well. His relatives  are my constituents, and my office is providing any support that we  can, but the ultimate responsibility is on Hamas to release Ofer and  all hostages immediately and unconditionally.   I urge those terrorists to salvage a shred of humanity by releasing  him and by releasing all the others held hostage, but I understand also  that the hopes of finding a shred of humanity within Hamas are close to  nil, which is why I remind my colleagues here today that we cannot  handcuff Israel with calls for a unilateral cease-fire as they work to  achieve their primary shared goal we all have: bringing all of the  hostages home.
