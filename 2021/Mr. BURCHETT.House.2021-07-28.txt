 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Charles  Rose, a good friend of mine. He was a brave veteran who passed away on  July 24 at 97 years old.   Charles was a corporal in the United States Marine Corps during World  War II. He fought in the Battles of Tarawa, Saipan, and Tinian in the  Pacific, and was awarded a Bronze Star with valor for his bravery.   In 1953, Charles married the love of his life, Jane, and they had  four sons: Steve, Tim, Mark, and Dennis.   I was honored to speak about Steve on the House floor a few months  ago after he passed away. He was a great veteran, just like his dad.   Charles also had 12 grandchildren and 28 great-grandchildren, who  loved him dearly, and they were his pride and joy.   Charles worked hard all his life. In 1969, he decided to go into  business for himself. He founded his own septic tank business where the  motto is ``A Flush Beats a Full House Every Time.'' It is still going  strong today, being run by his sons and grandsons. He also became a  Baptist minister and inspired everyone he knew with his love for the  Lord.   Charles always used to say, ``plain talk is easy understood.'' He hit  me with that nugget of wisdom several times, and I won't forget it. It  was an honor to call him my friend, and he will be missed by those who  knew him. Rest in peace, brother.                            ____________________
