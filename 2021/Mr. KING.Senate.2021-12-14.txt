 Madam President, today I wish to recognize LT Sean  McDonald, U.S. Navy, for his outstanding work on behalf of the people  of Maine and the Nation as a 2021 Department of Defense Legislative  Fellow serving in my Washington, DC, office. Lieutenant McDonald has  been integral to shaping my foreign policy and national security  priorities and helped secure a number of provisions in the fiscal year  2022 National Defense Authorization Act--FY22 NDAA--that will make our  country stronger and safer. Lieutenant McDonald's contributions, both  to office morale and to our collective work product, are representative  of his good character, competence, and strong work ethic.   Throughout his tenure in my office, Lieutenant McDonald demonstrated  a level of professionalism and hard work I have come to expect--but  that I do not take for granted--from Department of Defense Legislative  Fellows. Indeed, Lieutenant McDonald follows a long line of  accomplished U.S. Navy and Marine Corps officers who have made  impactful contributions to my office and to U.S. national security  policy. Over the course of the year, Lieutenant McDonald prepared and  personally advised me on wide-ranging and complex matters under  consideration before the Senate Armed Services Committee. Lieutenant  McDonald brought his naval expertise to bear to help secure  authorization for the procurement of additional Arleigh Burke-class  destroyers in the FY22 NDAA, a critical capability for the U.S. fleet  and a boon to the Maine shipbuilding workforce. He also helped guide my  work as chairman of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces during my  inaugural year in this position, helping craft policy on nuclear and  strategic forces, missile defense, and space programs. Further, during  the withdrawal of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, Lieutenant McDonald  provided clear-headed and thoughtful analysis on the withdrawal and  liaised with representatives from the White House, State Department,  and Department of Defense to convey my positions and concerns. His  candor and honest assessments provided critical insights during this  challenging time, and our Nation is better because of it.   On behalf of my colleagues and the U.S. Congress, I thank Lieutenant  McDonald for his dedicated service to my staff, the U.S. Navy, and the  Nation. I wish him all the best and know that he will excel in his next  endeavors.                            ____________________
