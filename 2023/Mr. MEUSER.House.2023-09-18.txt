 Mr. Speaker, the numbers don't lie, and data shows a  staggering unmitigated disaster continues at our southern border.   There have been 5.8 million illegal crossings since Biden took  office, 1.6 million got-aways, nearly 24,000 pounds of fentanyl, and  146 crossers on the terror watch list.   Mr. Speaker, Biden's open border policy is a cancer on our country,  and it is making our Nation very sick.   One statistic that stands out to me in the wake of the manhunt for  the escaped fugitive in Pennsylvania, a murderer who came here  illegally and terrorized Pennsylvania communities for 2 weeks, is the  number of criminal noncitizen arrests, Mr. Speaker.   Over 10,000 illegal aliens have been arrested this year who had  serious convictions on their record. That is compared to 2,400 in 2020  during Trump's last year in office. These weren't petty convictions.  These were for murder, rape, assault, DUI, drug trafficking, weapons  trafficking, and more.   Mr. Speaker, this administration is turning a blind eye to our  immigration laws. If the White House won't stop it, this House needs  to.                            ____________________
