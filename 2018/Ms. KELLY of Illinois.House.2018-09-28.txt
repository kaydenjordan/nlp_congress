 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank a longtime  staff member, my deputy chief of staff, Audra Wilson.   After more than 5 years of service to the people of Illinois' Second  Congressional District, Audra is leaving my office to serve as the new  executive director of the League of Women Voters of Illinois.   I first met Audra in 2003 while serving as a State representative.  Audra has been with my congressional staff from day one. As my deputy  chief of staff and district director, she has played an important role  in organizing essential district programming like our jobs and health  fairs, our local Black Women & Girls programming, and has skillfully  maintained our local district task forces.   Audra is also my constant plus one whenever I want to grab a bite of  Indian food.   I congratulate Audra and her family, especially her beautiful and  brilliant daughter, Ava, my future district director in the year 2038.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have had the privilege to work with  Audra, and on behalf of the people she served for over 5 years, I  commend her and say: Job well done.                            ____________________
