 Mr. Speaker, I rise and strongly oppose this bill. It  would hurt families. It would hurt seniors. It would hurt workers. We  must uphold rather than undermine our country's strong economic  recovery and standing.   We are here to govern. That means paying for what Congress has  already approved. We cannot default on the national debt. The only way  forward is to cleanly raise the debt ceiling.   I am saying to you, Mr. Speaker, we are ready. We need to raise the  debt.
