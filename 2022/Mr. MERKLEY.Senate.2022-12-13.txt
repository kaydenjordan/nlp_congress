 Madam President, on December 12, 2022, I missed rollcall  vote No. 387, confirmation of Tamika R. Montgomery-Reeves, of Delaware,  to be United States Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit due to my  attendance at an event back home in Oregon that required me to fly back  on a later flight. Had I been in attendance, I would have voted yea.   An expert in corporate law during her time as a corporate litigator  in private practice, Justice Montgomery-Reeves has served as a Delaware  State court judge since 2015. She has blazed a trail as the first Black  woman to serve on both the Delaware Supreme Court and Delaware Court of  Chancery. A jurist who has earned a reputation for fairness,  consideration, and consensus-building, Justice Montgomery-Reeves has  participated in thousands of decisions and authored more than 300  opinions since joining the bench.   Justice Tamika R. Montgomery-Reeves is imminently qualified and will  do an exemplary job for the people  [[Page S7133]]  of Delaware and the people of the United States on the Third Circuit  Court of Appeals.                            ____________________
