 Madam Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R.  828, my legislation to honor the life and legacy of former Congressman  William Carney by renaming the post office in Smithtown, New York, in  his honor.   Congressman Carney was a beloved husband, father, and grandfather,  but for our community, for New York's First Congressional District, for  our Nation, and for the ideals in which he believed, he was a fighter  until the very end.   Even before his life in politics, his commitment to serving his  country and community never wavered. After attending Florida State  University, Congressman Carney joined the United States Army Medical  Corps, where he served from 1961 to 1964.   After leaving the Army and working in the private sector, Congressman  Carney was elected to the Suffolk County legislature for 3 years before  being elected to the United States House of Representatives to  represent the First Congressional District of New York from 1979 to  1987.   He was the first registered Conservative Party member to ever be  elected to Congress. He was a relentless fighter for his constituents  and the ideals in which he believed, and he had a long list of  accomplishments to show for it.   Legislation he introduced and ushered into law designated areas of  the Fire Island Seashore as wilderness, ensuring its conservation and  protection for generations to come. To this day, Fire Island remains  one of Long Island's most iconic landmarks thanks, in part, to his  legislation.   Always so very proud of America's servicemembers and having served in  the Army himself, Representative Carney was a proud cosponsor of the  Korean War Memorial Act, as well as the resolution to recognize the  vital role played by members of the National Guard and Reserves in the  defense of our Nation.   Mr. Carney will be remembered for his strength, integrity, and  commitment to his district and Nation. There is no place he loved more  than Long Island, no people he more admired, and there is no doubt  there is no place he would rather have his legacy enshrined than in the  community that he called home.   Nearly 2 years ago, Congressman Carney lost his final battle. He was  suffering from prostate cancer.   He is survived by his wife and childhood sweetheart, Barbara  Haverlin; his two daughters, Jackie and Julie; and his four  grandchildren. Thank you to each and every one of them for allowing  their husband, father, and grandfather to dedicate his life to serving  our community.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.                                time  1330
