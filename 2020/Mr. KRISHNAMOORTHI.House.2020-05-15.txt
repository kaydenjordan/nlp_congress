 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   I rise in support of the HEROES Act.   Why?   Because our firefighters and first responders are heroes. They  deserve to remain employed.   Because our frontline and healthcare workers are heroes. They deserve  to have more testing and PPE.   Our small business people are heroes, too, and they deserve relief,  also.   Heroic people need our action today. Inaction would not be heroic.
