 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I must oppose the so-called Community Safety and  Security Act. This highly flawed bill is an example of why regular  order and a meaningful, deliberative process is essential to the proper  crafting of legislation.   Last April, the Supreme Court, in Sessions v. Dimaya, ruled that a  portion of the criminal code's definition of criminal violence is  unconstitutionally vague. That was nearly 6 months ago.   The Judiciary Committee has had ample time to examine the decision,  to hold hearings, to gather input from a range of stakeholders, and to  carefully develop legislation through markup and regular order--but  none of those things have happened.   Instead, a bill with significant ramifications for criminal law in  immigration cases was introduced just last week while Members were out  of town and is being rushed to the floor today without any hearings,  without any markup, without any adequate opportunity for review by the  public, by legal experts, or by stakeholders. So it is not a surprise  that we are left with many unanswered questions and concerns about the  impact of the bill.   The term ``crime of violence'' is referred to throughout the criminal  code and is, for example, used to determine whether a juvenile may be  prosecuted as an adult in Federal court. It also has serious  implications in immigration law because a noncitizen convicted of an  aggravated felony, described under the Immigration and Nationality Act  to include a crime of violence under this section, is deportable and  would be denied the opportunity for certain discretionary relief from  removal.   If we do not define this term properly, it could have significant  adverse consequences. H.R. 6691 specifies a long list of offenses that  would be considered crimes of violence, some of which are not currently  included in the Federal criminal code. The bill further defines some of  the offenses that are in the code, adding layers of confusion to the  bill.   We need proper definitions. For example, the crime of fleeing is  identified as a crime of violence. Now, if by fleeing you mean that,  when the cop pulls you over, you hit the gas and flee at 100 miles per  hour, endangering anybody on the road, that is a crime of violence. But  if by fleeing it is meant that you don't pull over immediately because  you are looking for a safe place to stop, well, that probably shouldn't  be a crime of violence, and yet, in this bill, it seems to be.   We should carefully examine all of these offenses to determine which  are appropriate to be included in this definition, and we should  consider what the consequences will be for each one.   In writing for the majority in Dimaya, Justice Kagan noted that:         A host of issues respecting the definition of ``crime of       violence'' application to specific crimes divide the Federal       appellate courts.    Although Congress has the power to clarify the definition or to  establish a new one, as this bill would do, it is absolutely essential  that we consider carefully what offenses should be included.   Indeed, in considering a change to the definition of ``crime of  violence'' for the purposes of the sentencing guidelines, the United  States Sentencing Commission held a hearing and received testimony. It  also sought public comments in response to proposed revisions. At a  minimum, we should do the same.   Finally, I note that, even in the brief time since the bill has been  introduced, a week, a broad array of advocates have expressed  opposition to this bill, including the American Civil Liberties Union  and Families Against Mandatory Minimums.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for the additional  time.   Others opposing the bill are Asian Americans Advancing Justice, the  Immigrant Justice Network, the Immigrant Defense Project, the National  Center for Lesbian Rights, the National Association of Criminal Defense  Lawyers, and others. Such opposition should, at the very least, tell us  that we should not be considering this legislation without thoughtful  deliberation.   This bill is a perfect example of a bill whose topics should be  covered, but we could do it properly instead of having a sloppily  drafted bill that does things we don't know it does and doesn't do  things we think it does. We must have a hearing. We should have  testimony. We should carefully consider this bill, and then we should  pass some version of it.   For those reasons, I oppose passage of this version of this bill, and  I ask that we take the time to examine this issue through regular  order.
