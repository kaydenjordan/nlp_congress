 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me  time and for his work on this very important resolution.   Mr. Speaker, last month, as fans streamed out of a concert in  Manchester, they were met by the worst kind of despicable treachery. A  terrorist lay in wait with his time bomb to inflict maximum damage on  people, killing as many as he could and creating fear among survivors.  Twenty-two innocent people were slaughtered, including many children.   The attack claimed by ISIS thugs was, unfortunately, not the last to  hit the United Kingdom. Over the weekend, terrorists attacked innocent  civilians in London, killing 7 and wounding at least 48 others.   Free countries cannot and must not tolerate these attacks and must  not ever accept these attacks as the norm. We must defeat the cancer of  Islamic  [[Page H4640]]  terrorism and the perverted thinking that inspires it.   I strongly support this resolution which condemns the attack in  Manchester and expresses our support to the people of the United  Kingdom. We will and must continue to stand together with the United  Kingdom for many reasons, but the main reason being the bond of freedom  that we have shared for so many years. We must stand together to combat  and defeat those who seek to attack freedom and liberty and destroy our  way of life. They must not win.   Mr. Speaker, I offer my sincere condolences to the victims of the  attacks in the United Kingdom and their families. This evil cannot be  allowed to continue without a bold response.   Mr. Speaker, justice demands that we track down these terrorists and  hold them accountable for their evil deeds whenever and wherever they  attack. Justice must be served because, Mr. Speaker, justice is what  free people demand.   And that is just the way it is.    Mr. Speaker, at dawn, in the hard cold rain of the  choppy English Channel, thousands of men--boys, really--aboard landing  craft assaulted the beaches in a place called Normandy, France. They  were under brutal enemy gunfire and artillery shelling. That was the  morning of June 6, 1944: D-Day.   Their buddies, the paratroopers, had earlier, before dawn, landed in  France and met the same stiff resistance by the enemy. The Allies were  determined to free Europe from the Nazis; and after the gunfire ceased  and the smoke cleared, the successful assault that day was costly.   At the top of the cliffs of Normandy, among the white crosses and  glistening Stars of David, is the national cemetery of America's war  dead. There are 9,387 Americans buried there. The average age is 24.  They were the initial casualties of the invasion of Europe. More  Americans would later die in the great World War II.   Today, we remember those who fought on June 6 and other Americans,  like my 91-year-old dad, who went to liberate France and not to conquer  it. These warriors are the charter members of the Greatest Generation.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
