 Mr. Speaker, I came down to the floor today to give a  gentle reminder and a wake-up call to Chairman Gowdy and to Speaker  Ryan. I know they have a lot going on. The Speaker is flying out to do  a fundraiser today. But I want to make sure he actually understood that  what we know, also from multiple media outlets, is that this President  is using a phone that is potentially compromising national security.   Rather than use the best, most secure communication technology in the  world, President Trump just reaches into his pocket and pulls out his  regular off-the-shelf phone when he wants to discuss matters of state.  Now, he can switch to another phone, a government-provided phone, one  that is secure, and he can still even tweet from that phone, but, for  some reason, he is still stuck on this phone that is a national  security risk.   Why would the leader of the free world, and our Commander in Chief,  expose sensitive communication to foreign intelligence agencies?   Why would he act in such a reckless, negligent manner?   Well, according to news reports, the simple answer is that Donald  Trump uses his personal cell phone because he just feels like it; it is  more convenient for him. Forget the rules and forget the warnings from  the military. He just does what he wants and ignores the consequences.   I want to highlight this story for Chairman Gowdy and Speaker Ryan  because I know they care deeply about data security at the highest  level of our government. After all, when Secretary Clinton was found to  have used her personal email server, they launched multiple, month-long  investigations. They spent millions of tax dollars conducting five  emergency hearings, including four, coincidentally, right before the  election, and ended up issuing more than 70 subpoenas.    Their efforts helped generate huge amounts of media coverage. In one  6-day period, The New York Times ran as many cover stories about  Hillary Clinton's emails as they did about all of the policy issues  combined in the 69 days leading up to the election.   But now that President Trump's widely irresponsible use of his  personal cell phone has been exposed, now that we know he could be  exposing America's secrets to our gravest enemies, surely my Republican  friends are going to be just as worried about data security as they  were in the past and conduct some oversight. Surely, they will. They  surely will demand and request all the documents, hold hearings, and  question witnesses. Surely. They will want to get to the bottom of this  scandal as soon as possible.   Prior to the election, Chairman Gowdy explained to the reporters:         This investigation is not about politics. This is not even       about one individual.    If it wasn't about politics, and if it wasn't just about stopping  Hillary Clinton, the Speaker of the House and the chairman of the  Oversight and Government Reform Committee should certainly feel  interested in investigating the President's cell phone use. And yet,  coincidentally, they have been completely silent. Not one press  statement, not one letter, not one word of warning to the White House.   It is almost as if they have no interest in conducting real oversight  of this President. It is almost as if they are more interested in  helping this President than holding him accountable. It is almost as if  this Republican Party has completely lost its moral compass under this  President.   Mr. Speaker, perhaps my good friend, Congressman Ted Lieu, could shed  some light on more of these troubling issues for me.
