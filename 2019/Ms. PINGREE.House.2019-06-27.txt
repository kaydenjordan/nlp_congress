 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I rise in recognition of July as American  Grown Flowers Month.   As co-chair of the House Cut Flowers Caucus, I know the buy local  movement has encouraged customers to buy not only their food, but also  their flowers, from local farmers. People want to support the small  family farm down the road, whether it is lettuce or lilies.   The cut flower industry creates jobs, benefits our local economies,  and naturally encourages us to embrace our planet's natural beauty.   For farmers, cut flowers allow us to preserve open spaces,  participate in sustainable agriculture, and, many times, support women- owned businesses.   In my home State of Maine, where I represent many small farms, more  than 250 farms sell cut flowers, from the Snell Family Farm in Buxton  to Lazy Acres Farm in Farmingdale.   This is an industry worth upwards of $1 million to our economy and  has seen such rapid growth in recent years that we have many flower  CSAs for local customers. The new interest in locally sourced flowers  has allowed farmers to diversify their crops and boost their income.   In Maine, nationally recognized as ``Vacationland,'' cut flowers are  essential to our tourism industry. Flowers decorate wedding venues,  hotels, and restaurants across our State. And when you are celebrating  something as special as a wedding or a long-awaited vacation, shouldn't  everything, down to the flowers on the table, have some meaning?                            ____________________
