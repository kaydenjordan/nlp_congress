 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3648 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  Baldwin, Smith, Gillibrand, Peters, and Durbin amendment that will help  support good-paying union jobs, address the impacts of climate change  on the Great Lakes, and support billions of dollars in revenue and  wages.   The U.S. Great Lakes waterborne commerce supports more than 147,000  jobs in eight Great Lakes States. This is made possible by the Coast  Guard's Great Lakes icebreakers that ensure ships can safely transit in  and out of our ports in the winter. Unfortunately, the number of  icebreaking vessels on the Great Lakes has declined, resulting in  economic loss, including an estimated 5,400 jobs in the 2018-2019  winter season.   Additionally, climate change is resulting in more heavy-ice winters  and increasing intensity and frequency of extreme storms that are  impacting ice cover thickness and unpredictable ice floes.   My amendment would ensure that the Great Lakes has sufficient  icebreaking capacity and keep our Nation's economy moving forward.  Chair Cantwell supports the Great Lakes icebreaker, and I urge my  colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment and ask for the yeas and  nays.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
