 Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban  Affairs be discharged and the Senate proceed to the immediate en bloc  consideration of the following bills: S. 3685, the Emergency Rental  Assistance and Rental Market Stabilization Act, which I am a prime  sponsor of, and S. 4097, Senator Warren's bill, the Protecting Renters  from Evictions and Fees Act. I further ask that the bills be considered  read a third time and passed en bloc and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President.    I am disappointed. I knew it was coming from Senator  Crapo. He is my friend, and I appreciate the cooperation, but this is  so much more serious than what we did a few months ago.   We have been asking just down the hall--Senator McConnell was just  in. We have asked him week after week after week--April, May, June,  half of July--to do something about this impending problem we have.   This is why we have to do this now. Tomorrow, millions of families  face a massive cliff, and they face another one in a week. Right now,  millions of Americans are in danger of losing their homes. In the CARES  Act, we put a temporary moratorium on evictions and foreclosures for  renters and homeowners and properties with federally backed loans, as  well as for renters receiving Federal assistance. It is a good thing  entirely, just not enough. This rental eviction moratorium expires  tomorrow.   The last thing we need--imagine this: In the middle of a public  health crisis, people who get evicted roam the streets, or they go to  an overcrowded shelter, or they go live in their cousin's basement--all  potentially spreading the virus.   We know the moratorium didn't go far enough. It only covered 28  percent of renters. We should be extending and expanding the  moratorium. We should be passing my emergency rental assistance bill to  get people through this pandemic, not kicking them out on the streets.   We already had a housing crisis in this country before the  coronavirus hit. Many of the professions we are now recognizing as  essential--one essential worker, a grocery store worker, said:         I don't feel essential. They call me essential. I feel       expendable because I don't make much money, and they don't       protect you at work.    Many of those people recognized as essential aren't paid enough to  afford housing.   Think about this: One-quarter of all renters--one out of four  renters--before the pandemic were paying half or more of their income  in rent. One thing happens in their lives, and they are on the streets.  Now we are seeing millions of people all at once have those same  emergencies. They are facing impossible choices between rent and  grocery or prescriptions or draining their savings or going to a payday  lender. More than 40 percent--40 percent--of Black and Latinx renters  report they are unlikely to be able to make their next payment--40  percent.   Some people don't have any choice at all. Their only option is  eviction. Those evictions are already happening in Columbus, the  capital city in Ohio, the largest city in Ohio. In Columbus, they have  turned the convention center into an eviction court--an eviction court  at the convention center. More eviction filings will be coming if we do  nothing.   For all those renters who have been protected from eviction by the  CARES Act, back rent will suddenly be due. They will owe for March and  April and May and June. The same goes for the millions who aren't  protected under  [[Page S4450]]  the CARES Act but got relief from a temporary State or local moratorium  or court closure.   On top of that, at the end of next week, the additional $600 a week  in UI benefits expires. Senator Wyden has done yeoman's work. It is  incredible what he was able to do for this unemployment that kept  millions and millions and millions--tens of thousands of Oregonians and  hundreds of thousands of Ohioans were kept in their homes because of  this $600 unemployment check that they got weekly. Now, because Senator  McConnell doesn't care, President Trump doesn't care, those people are  going to lose that $600. What do they do then? We know that UI didn't  cover everyone, but for many people, that $600 was the difference  between being able to pay their bills and skipping meals or draining  their savings or having to turn to a payday lender.   We need to extend the assistance to help families afford their food  and prescriptions. We need to provide emergency rental assistance to  keep a roof over their heads.   This problem isn't some distant cliff. We are all about to go home  for the week. This doesn't happen a month from now or 3 months from  now; this happens starting this week. It happens when unemployment  expires. It happens when these moratoria around the country expire.   What is President Trump doing? What is Majority Leader McConnell  doing? Nothing. Maybe going to Mar-a-Lago, maybe going back to  Kentucky. I don't know. What are they doing about this impending cliff?  Nothing.   We asked them in March. We asked them in April, in May, and in June.  Two-thirds of the way into July, they still refuse to help.   Because of this President's failures, this crisis isn't getting any  better, the virus continues to spread, people continue to die, small  businesses continue to suffer.   Why would we let up on the relief people need now? The work we do in  this body to get help to people simply can't make up for the lack of  leadership from the White House, but it can mitigate some of the  damages.   The House passed the Heroes Act nearly 2 months ago. That would have  eliminated these cliffs. It would have provided $100 billion in  emergency relief. But do you know what? That bill has been on the  majority leader's desk collecting dust since May.   For millions of families about to lose their unemployment, about to  lose their homes, and not able to feed their kids, the bills keep  coming, the clock keeps ticking, the stress keeps mounting. People are  tired of this lack of action and lack of accountability.   They are tired of being betrayed--``betrayed'' is the right word-- betrayed by this President, who is supposed to look out for them. They  are tired of feeling like no one is on their side. That is why we need  to do this.   We are supposed to be the greatest country on Earth. The American  people should not have to fend for themselves in the middle of a once- in-a-generation crisis. It is time to lead where the President has  failed. It is time for Leader McConnell to let us do our job. It is  time to keep families from losing their homes. That is really clear.   I yield the floor to the sponsor of this other bill that is so very  important, Senator Warren.
