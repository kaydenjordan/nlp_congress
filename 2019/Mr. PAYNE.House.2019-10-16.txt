 Madam Speaker, I would like to take a moment to praise my  district's 2019 Congressional Award winner, Ms. Sage Savoia-Di Gregorio  from Maplewood, New Jersey.   This award is given to youth who achieve extraordinary results in  four different categories: public service, physical fitness, personal  development, and geographic exploration.   Sage was more than up to the challenge: She joined AmeriCorps and  built outdoor trails in Virginia; she renovated museums and education  centers in New Jersey; she helped clean and maintain a natural park in  Kentucky; and she provided disaster relief to victims of Hurricane  Florence in South Carolina--all this, while she maintained a strict  workout regime every week.   She deserves this award, and I am proud to call her a resident of the  10th Congressional District of New Jersey.                            ____________________
