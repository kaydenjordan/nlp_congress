 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my  support for ending U.S. involvement in the war in Afghanistan.   Mr. Speaker, wars are supposed to end. In the time that we have been  in Afghanistan, I have graduated from middle school, I have graduated  from high school, I have graduated from college and grad school, worked  at the U.N. and the State Department, started two organizations, and  was elected to Congress.   I represent San Diego, a proud military community, and one that knows  better than most the human cost of war. Ending this war does not  invalidate those sacrifices. It recognizes them. We are indebted to the  thousands of servicemembers who answered the call to serve, and we  remember those who never came home. It is in their honor that we look  to the next challenge.   Now it is time to prioritize diplomatic and humanitarian work in  Afghanistan, to reassert Congress' authority on war powers, and to  focus our efforts on the security needs of the future, not the past.                            ____________________
