 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, as we have been debating the  amendments to this energy and water bill, for some of the amendments I  have risen in strong support and strong opposition.   With all due respect to the gentleman from California, I rise in the  staunchest opposition to his amendment.   Mr. Chairman, our Nation's nuclear deterrent--and for the people at  home watching--is done through the NNSA. The NNSA is the National  Nuclear Security Administration. It is part of the Department of  Energy.   As part of that key mission and as part of this great bill, we are  fully funding and need to continue to fully fund the updates to our  weapons programs to keep our nuclear deterrent strong.   Currently, the plutonium pits are being done and made at Los Alamos.  They do an outstanding job. We are so fortunate that our great friends  at the Savannah River reservation--and I have been there, and I have  been in this facility that is being built--will work to create new  plutonium pits.   The world is a dangerous place. Vladimir Putin, with his outrageous,  wrong invasion of Ukraine must be stopped.   This man has basically threatened to use nuclear weapons. That is  intolerable rhetoric. That is intolerable conduct. The strongest way to  oppose that is to have a robust nuclear deterrent.   Our bill does that. Los Alamos does that. The NNSA does that. Thank  goodness our friends at the great Savannah River reservation have done  that for years and will continue to help our Nation's nuclear arsenal  with this facility to produce plutonium pits. The Chinese are growing  their nuclear arsenal. The world is moving in the wrong direction.   My hero, Ronald Reagan, in 1980 said, grow our nuclear deterrent, and  he did that. I can remember standing in a college class with 200  students. I was the only person to stand up to fight the nuclear  freeze.   Ronald Reagan was right. We defeated the evil empire, the Soviet  Union, because we did not do a freeze. We stood up and built up our  nuclear deterrent. We have to do that now.   Our partners at Savannah River are there. They are ready. This  facility will supplement that.   With all due respect to the gentleman from California, he is wrong on  this. America needs its nuclear deterrent. The NNSA needs to be kept  strong, and this plutonium pit production for Savannah River needs to  go forward.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to Ms. Kaptur, my ranking  member.    Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Granger).   Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio  (Ms. Kaptur), my ranking member.                                time  1030     Mr. Chair, I yield to the distinguished gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Duncan). I would explain to the Chairman that this fine  gentleman is my counterpart on the authorization side on the Energy and  Commerce Committee. He has been a strong leader in nuclear and has been  my partner. I am the appropriator, and he is the authorizer.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Chair, I rise as the designee of the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Granger).   Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, once again, I respectfully and vehemently  disagree with my friend and colleague, the gentleman from California  (Mr. Garamendi).   I represent the great people of the city of Oak Ridge in Tennessee,  the birthplace of the Manhattan Project. The NNSA has a facility there.  It is called the Y-12 facility. We are building the uranium processing  facility.   That became very apparent to me when I was a college freshman  correctly arguing against a nuclear freeze, against a room full of  liberal, radical, leftist students. I knew I was right then because I  knew Ronald Reagan was right. What I didn't know then was that nuclear  weapons deteriorate. I thought if you had a nuclear weapon, you could  put it on a shelf, and if you needed it, you could go get it. The  reality is that nuclear weapons, by their nature, deteriorate and have  to be updated.   Now, through three administrations--the Obama administration, the  Trump administration, and now the Biden administration--I have worked  hand in hand with the NNSA, the National Nuclear Security  Administration. To do what? To make sure that our current nuclear  arsenal, our nuclear deterrent, is strong.   Where I disagree respectfully and most vehemently with my colleague  from California is that our resolve is to tell the world today, whether  it is in Moscow, Beijing, or any of the other countries that have a  nuclear capability--and sadly, to my colleague, there are at least 10  countries now that have the ability to produce and deliver a nuclear  weapon. That is scary. The resolve of the people of the United States  must be to have a strong nuclear deterrent today and in the future.  That is why we have to have this program. That is why we have to keep  our Nation's nuclear arsenal strong and vibrant now and in the future.   Specifically, Mr. Chairman, the W87-1 Modification Program will  replace the W78 warhead and support fielding the Air Force Sentinel  missile system. Mr. Chair, we have our nuclear triad--land based; sea,  with our great United States Navy; and Air Force. It is a triad, and it  is a strong triad. This is the message to the world, that we can never  have a nuclear weapon used and deployed.    Listen to Mr. Putin. He is threatening it. That is outrageous. We can  never have that type of rhetoric in the world. We have to stand against  that.   The strongest way to do that is a nuclear deterrent and a commitment,  not only to our friends in Savannah River, not only to our friends in  Oak Ridge, but all over the United States. We have strong weapons labs  that are doing a great job. The men and women of the NNSA are our great  patriots. They are within the Department of Energy. The customer is the  Department of Defense, but we are doing a tremendous job.   I wish the world were a benign place. I wish it were a world without  nuclear weapons, but they are existent. They are there. We are the  leader in protecting the free world. We have to protect the people of  the United States. We have to send a message.   Mr. Chair, I, therefore, strongly and vehemently oppose the  gentleman's amendment. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   On this issue I agree with Ranking Member Kaptur. While I recognize  the current administration has gone too far in pursuing its climate  goals, I believe there are aspects of this program we can all support.  In particular, the SuperTruck program awardees represent the largest  producers of medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the United States. The  potential research and development of benefits are still worthy of  pursuit. For these reasons, I oppose the gentlewoman's amendment.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I thank the ranking member for  yielding.   While I can completely understand the frustrations many of my  colleagues may experience in some of their dealings with some of the  aspects and personnel in the executive branch, respectfully, I think  reducing the salaries to a dollar is not likely to solve the problem.  In fact, it may create even more problems in a challenging environment.   So with all due respect to my colleague from Florida, I urge my  colleagues to oppose this amendment.    Madam Chair, I thank my ranking member for yielding  to me, and I did hear both of my colleagues. Respectfully, I disagree  with this amendment.   I do not think that attempting to reduce salaries to a dollar is  likely to address this problem, and it may very well create more  problems than it attempts to solve.   Madam Chair, I respectfully oppose the amendment and urge my  colleagues to oppose the same.    Mr. Chairman, I hold my dear colleague and friend  from Texas in the highest esteem. I think he is one of our brightest  and best Members, and he has served so well on the Energy and Commerce  Committee. It is a pleasure and privilege to serve with him. I play  baseball with him, and candidly, he is a much better baseball player  than I am. I trust his judgment, but respectfully, on this issue, I  want to be consistent.   I have opposed reducing salaries to $1 in the previous amendments. He  articulated his issues very well, but I do think this causes a  dangerous, difficult precedent. In that regard, I urge a ``no'' vote.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to  me.   Mr. Chair, as with the previous amendment, I fully understand and  appreciate my distinguished colleague's frustrations. However, I  respectfully disagree that reducing the salary to a dollar is the way  to address that.   Mr. Chair, I respectfully urge a ``no'' vote on that, and I thank my  esteemed colleague for his amendment.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, in regard to the energy and water bill  that is before the House today, I respectfully rise in opposition to  the amendment.   We discussed earlier today in some very strong and positive debates  about the role of the NNSA and the strong nuclear arsenal aspect of the  Department of Energy, which is so critically important, and I debated  against my Democratic colleagues in that regard. That is all part of  this great energy and water bill. It is a wonderful robust bill, not  only for the Department of Energy, but also for the water side of the  bill.   The reduction proposed in this amendment would negatively impact  national security and critical infrastructure programs in the bill. As  I alluded to, this bill has both defense and nondefense spending in it.   The amendment makes no distinction of where the reductions would come  from, instead allowing the Biden administration to administer the  reductions as they see fit. I would not trust the administration to do  that. I think Congress needs to do that. That would likely affect the  NNSA, as I have alluded to, and I cannot respectfully support any  amendment that would jeopardize the balance of this bill, therefore, I  oppose the gentleman's amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I wish to thank my friend, the  distinguished gentleman from Montana, for offering this amendment.   I know many of us have frustrations with some of the Army Corps'  projects. However, this reduction by $620 million I must oppose for  several reasons.   The reduction proposed in this amendment would, in my view,  jeopardize critical ongoing Corps of Engineers projects across this  great country, including in my district, the great Chickamauga Lock  Project in the Third District of Tennessee.   All too often the Corps of Engineers fails to finish what it starts.  This bill provides funding to complete a number of significant  projects. A cut of this magnitude would, in my view, undermine public  safety and America's economic competitiveness.   It is in that regard that I respectfully urge my colleagues to oppose  this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Clerk  be authorized to make technical corrections in the engrossment of H.R.  4394, to include corrections in spelling, punctuation, section  numbering cross-referencing, and the insertion of appropriate headings.
