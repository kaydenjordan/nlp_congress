 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill to provide funding  for the heroes in our National Guard and Capitol Police, as well as the  brave people of Afghanistan who supported our troops overseas.   While I am disappointed it has taken this long to reach an agreement,  the bill before us today is a strong package that deserves our support.   This bill reimburses the National Guard, the Capitol Police, and  their law enforcement partners for the costs they incurred for their  heroic efforts on January 6; and the bill addresses safety and security  concerns by providing necessary improvements to the Capitol Complex.   The bill also provides much-needed assistance to our partners who  supported our military during the war in Afghanistan.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill, I urge my colleagues to support it,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
