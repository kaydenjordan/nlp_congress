 Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the Paramus community  and those who lost their lives in the Route 80 bus accident in Mt.  Olive, New Jersey, and to all those who were injured. My heart breaks  for the 38 fifth grade students and seven adults involved in  yesterday's horrific bus accident.   On a day when students from East Brook Middle School should have been  enjoying their class trip, instead, they experienced every parent's  worst nightmare. As a father, I am praying for every parent, child,  teacher, friend, and administrator; and I know I will be hugging my  kids extra tight this evening.   I join the Paramus community as they come together to support all  those affected in this tragedy, especially the family of the student  who lost their life and the family of Jennifer Williamson, the fifth  grade social studies teacher chaperoning the trip, who lost her life.   May God rest their souls.   Savannah Clark, an East Brook Middle School sixth grader, remembered  her teacher saying: She made things really, really fun for us kids, but  now she can't anymore.   Mrs. Williamson, your care for our community will never be forgotten.   I also want to thank the first responders, doctors, and nurses who  responded so quickly to help students, care for the victims, and  investigate how such a horrible tragedy could ever have happened.                            ____________________
