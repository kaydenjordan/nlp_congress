 Mr. Speaker, I commend the commitment that Chairman  Royce and Ranking Member Engel have shown in holding North Korea  accountable for its illicit activity, and it is a long list.   Mr. Speaker, I want to also commend my good friend and colleague,  Congressman Joe Wilson, for authoring this important measure, H. Res.  92, condemning North Korea's development of multiple intercontinental  ballistic missiles, or ICBMs.   Recently, North Korea has made the calculation that it either needs  to flex its muscles through the test of ballistic missiles or, at the  very least, provoke an international response so that the regime can  use it as propaganda against the West.   We have seen dozens of missile tests over the past year, and, just as  troubling, at least two nuclear tests. I know that this is resolution  condemning North Korea's provocative action, but I do think this is an  opportunity to call attention to the Iranian nuclear and ballistic  missile program. What I and some of my colleagues have been saying for  years now is that Iran has been following the North Korea playbook.   We signed a weak and dangerous nuclear deal with North Korea, and  what was the result? A nuclear-armed Pyongyang that is testing and  upgrading its ballistic and nuclear program unchecked and possibly even  proliferating these materials, or at least the know-how, to Iran.   We concluded a weak and dangerous nuclear deal with Iran, and you can  be sure, if we don't do more to press Iran, we will be welcoming  another dangerous regime to the nuclear weapons club.   While we rightfully condemn North Korea for its provocations, we must  be mindful that, if we follow the same path and make the same mistakes,  it will be Iran in a few years that will have a nuclear weapon and  ballistic missile program that can threaten global security, and that  is in none of our interests.   I urge my colleagues to fully support Mr. Wilson's measure, Mr.  Speaker, but I also urge them to realize the failures of past policies  and what got us here to this point with North Korea and not to allow  the same mistakes to happen with respect to Iran.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce for the time.   Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to be standing here in strong support of  the measure of my very good friend from New Jersey, Mr. Albio Sires. H.  Res. 54 is so important. It reaffirms the U.S.-Argentina partnership  and recognizes Argentina's economic reforms. As Mr. Royce said, I am  proud to be an original cosponsor of Mr. Sires' important resolution.   Up until the recent election of President Macri, Argentina was going  in the wrong direction. Since Macri came to office, he has made some  tough but much-needed economic reforms. He has shown that Argentina is  willing to be engaged in areas of mutual interest to our two countries  and expand our bilateral relations. President Macri's commitment to  these reforms should be commended.   But he hasn't just shown strong leadership on economic reforms.  President Macri has shown strong character and leadership to the rule  of law and pursuit of justice. He has done so by announcing his  intention to continue to investigate and prosecute those responsible  for the 1994 bombing of the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association, AMIA,  in Buenos Aires, Argentina.   Last month, we marked the 25th anniversary of the terrorist attack on  the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, which was followed by the 1994  AMIA attack.  [[Page H2611]]  It is no secret that the Iranian-backed terrorist group Hezbollah was  responsible for these attacks; yet, to this day, Mr. Speaker, Iran and  Hezbollah have evaded justice.                                time  1745    The United States should support President Macri as he continues his  investigation and seeks to hold those responsible accountable to make  sure that he can bring them to justice for their deadly terror attacks.   We should also applaud and support his decision to investigate the  suspicious circumstances involving the death of the special prosecutor  of these cases, Alberto Nisman. Alberto had uncovered links between  Hezbollah and these terror attacks, and I would speak with Alberto  frequently about these troublesome ties.   Nisman was a good man and a strong supporter of human rights. We must  help President Macri and the people of Argentina continue Nisman's work  and legacy by bringing those responsible for his death and for those  dastardly terrorist attacks to justice.   We can start by signaling to the people of Argentina that we support  their government and that we value our bilateral relationship. Passing  Mr. Sires' resolution will do just that. We will send that message.   I urge my colleagues to support Mr. Sires' measure.    Mr. Speaker, I stand in full support of Judge Poe's  bill, H.R. 479, the North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation  Act of 2017.   Over the years, as the chairman has said, I have repeatedly and  explicitly called for Pyongyang to be redesignated as a state sponsor  of terrorism, SST, country.   I stood in ardent opposition to the Bush administration's decision to  remove North Korea from the SST list, and in the years past, I  introduced similar legislation to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe),  which would see Pyongyang back on the list where it belongs.   The removal from the list was a failure of the nuclear negotiations  with North Korea, a concession given for nothing but empty promises in  return.   In much the same way that the Obama administration removed Cuba from  the SST list 2 years ago, the Bush administration got empty promises in  return for these terrible concessions, while the Obama administration  couldn't even get empty promises.    These designations are much more important than just tools for  negotiation, Mr. Speaker. They are there because these countries  actively support terror or they support or facilitate countries that do  support terror. They pose a very serious risk to U.S. national security  and global stability. This is not something to take lightly, and  removing North Korea from the SST list was a very serious error in  judgment.   It is far past time, Mr. Speaker, to correct this mistake, and it has  to start by having an honest and transparent determination made on  Pyongyang, its support for terror, and its ties to other state sponsor  of terrorism states like Iran.   I support Judge Poe's bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to pay tribute to the  city of West Miami in recognition of its 70th anniversary.   What began as a small town of 700 residents has flourished into a  haven for nearly 7,000 south Floridians, including my constituents,  Senator Marco Rubio and Miami-Dade County commissioners and former West  Miami Mayor Rebeca Sosa, who are proud to call West Miami home.   While the city itself is less than 1 square mile, the tremendous  growth that has graced West Miami in the past 70 years has led to the  creation of some of the finest public parks and summer camps in our  State.   To celebrate its founding, local officials, businesses, residents,  and their families will gather together on Saturday, April 8, at Cooper  Park, in celebration of this incredible milestone.   I am honored to represent the city of West Miami, and I thank all who  have dedicated countless hours to making this corner of south Florida  special for all of us to enjoy.                            ____________________
