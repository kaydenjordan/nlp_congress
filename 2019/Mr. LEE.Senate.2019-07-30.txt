 Madam President, I reserve the right to object after raising  a couple of observations.   It is important to know that this bill was passed by the House of  Representatives Thursday night. We just received the paperwork from the  House of Representatives yesterday. This is a bill that did not pass  unanimously in the House of Representatives--far from it. There were at  least 158 Republicans who voted against it.   There are a number of my colleagues in the Senate who, like me, would  like to see this and many other bills considered but would also like  the opportunity to adequately review the legislation as passed and to  propose amendments and have those amendments voted on. So passing this  bill right now without that opportunity to review it, to propose  amendments and have those considered, and just passing this unanimously  is not the way we ought to be passing this legislation.   I am happy to work with my distinguished colleague and my revered  friend from Illinois in moving in that direction, but we are not ready  to pass this by unanimous consent right now. We have amendments to  propose. So on that basis, I object.
