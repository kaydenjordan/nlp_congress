 Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out to the American  public and my colleagues in this Chamber and the U.S. Forest Service,  the extreme importance of all the fire devastation we have had in  Northern California and the need to immediately get upon the effort to  cover up the erosion that we are going to have there.   We need to mitigate the erosion that has a great potential to be  there. This fire here, the Dixie fire--currently almost put out--has  reached, finally, nearly a million acres, on top of the fire last year  and another 2 years before that.   We have over 1.5 million acres that have burned and are now a  repository for ash and erosion that is going to affect what is known as  the Feather River watershed, an extremely important watershed to the  California State Water Project whose customers number about 25 million  people in California, as well as much of agriculture.   We need that erosion control to happen immediately, especially on the  heels of the Beckwourth fire, the Dixie fire, so that we don't have our  streams, our rivers, our lakes, plugged up with ash, with soil that  makes it impossible for our water supply this coming year to be  delivered to people in agriculture.                            ____________________
