Classified report.       SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.         The purpose of this Act is to direct United States       resources to address human rights violations and abuses,       including gross violations of human rights, by the Government       of the People's Republic of China through the mass       surveillance and internment of over 1,000,000 Uyghurs, ethnic       Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim minority groups       in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.       SEC. 3. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The Government of the People's Republic of China has a       long history of repressing Turkic Muslims and other Muslim       minority groups, particularly Uyghurs, in Xinjiang Uyghur       Autonomous Region. In recent decades, central and regional       Chinese government policies have systematically discriminated       against these minority groups by denying them a range of       civil and political rights, including the freedom of       expression, religion, and movement, and the right to a fair       trial.        (2) In May 2014, the Government of the People's Republic of       China launched its latest ``Strike Hard Against Violent       Extremism'' campaign, using wide-scale, internationally-      linked threats of terrorism as a pretext to justify pervasive       restrictions on and serious human rights violations of       members of ethnic minority communities in Xinjiang Uyghur       Autonomous Region. The August 2016 appointment of former       Tibet Autonomous Region Party Secretary Chen Quanguo to be       Party Secretary of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region       accelerated the crackdown across the region. Scholars, human       rights organizations, journalists, and think tanks have       provided ample evidence substantiating the establishment by       the Government of the People's Republic of China of       internment camps. Since 2014, the Government of the People's       Republic of China has detained more than 1,000,000 Uyghurs,       ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim minority       groups in these camps. The total ethnic minority population       of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region was approximately       13,000,000 at the time of the last census conducted by the       People's Republic of China in 2010.        (3) The Government of the People's Republic of China's       actions against Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members       of other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous       Region violate international human rights laws and norms,       including--        (A) the International Convention on the Elimination of All       Forms of Racial Discrimination, to which the People's       Republic of China has acceded;        (B) the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman       or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which the People's       Republic of China has signed and ratified;        (C) the International Covenant on Civil and Political       Rights, which the People's Republic of China has signed; and        (D) the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.        (4) Senior Chinese Communist Party officials, including       current Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Party Secretary       Chen Quanguo, who executes Chinese government policy in the       region, and former Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Deputy       Party Secretary Zhu Hailun, who crafted many of the policies       implemented in the region, bear direct responsibility for       gross human rights violations committed against Uyghurs,       ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim minority       groups. These abuses include the arbitrary detention of more       than 1,000,000 Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members       of other Muslim minority groups, separation of working age       adults from children and the elderly, and the integration of       forced labor into supply chains.        (5) Those detained in internment camps in Xinjiang Uyghur       Autonomous Region have described forced political       indoctrination, torture, beatings, food deprivation, and       denial of religious, cultural, and linguistic freedoms. These       victims have confirmed that they were told by guards that the       only way to secure their release was to demonstrate       sufficient political loyalty. Poor conditions and lack of       medical treatment at such facilities appear to have       contributed to the deaths of some detainees, including the       elderly and infirm.        (6) Uyghurs and ethnic Kazakhs who have obtained permanent       residence or citizenship in other countries report being       subjected to threats and harassment from Chinese officials.       At least 5 journalists for Radio Free Asia's Uyghur service       have publicly detailed abuses their family members in       Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have endured in response to       their work exposing the Government of the People's Republic       of China's abusive policies.        (7) In September 2018, United Nations High Commissioner for       Human Rights Michelle Bachelet noted in her first speech as       High Commissioner the ``deeply disturbing allegations of       large-scale arbitrary detentions of Uighurs and other Muslim       communities, in so-called reeducation camps across       Xinjiang''.        (8) In 2019, the Congressional-Executive Commission on       China concluded that, based on available evidence, the       establishment and actions committed in the internment camps       in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region may constitute ``crimes       against humanity''.        (9) On December 31, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed       into law the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018 (Public       Law 115-409), which--        (A) condemns the People's Republic of China's ``forced       disappearances, extralegal detentions, invasive and       omnipresent surveillance, and lack of due process in judicial       proceedings'';        (B) authorizes funding to promote democracy, human rights,       and the rule of law in the People's Republic of China; and        (C) supports sanctions designations against any entity or       individual that--        (i) violates human rights or religious freedoms; or        (ii) engages in censorship activities.       SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the President should--        (A) condemn abuses against Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz,       members of other Muslim minority groups, and other persons by       authorities of the People's Republic of China; and        (B) call on such authorities to immediately--        (i) close the internment camps;        (ii) lift all restrictions on, and ensure respect for,       human rights; and        (iii) allow people inside the People's Republic of China to       reestablish contact with their loved ones, friends, and       associates outside the People's Republic of China;        (2) the Secretary of State should consider strategically       employing sanctions and other tools under the International       Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6401 et seq.),       including measures resulting from the designation of the       People's Republic of China as a country of particular concern       for religious freedom under section 402(b)(1)(A)(ii) of such       Act (22 U.S.C. 6442(b)(1)(A)(ii)), that directly address       particularly severe violations of religious freedom;        (3) the Secretary of State should--        (A) work with United States allies and partners and through       multilateral institutions to condemn the mass arbitrary       detention of Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of       other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous       Region; and        (B) coordinate closely with the international community on       targeted sanctions and visa restrictions;        (4) the journalists of the Uyghur language service of Radio       Free Asia should be commended for their reporting on the       human rights and political situation in Xinjiang Uyghur       Autonomous Region despite efforts by the Government of the       People's Republic of China to silence or intimidate their       reporting through the detention of family members and       relatives in China;        (5) the United States should expand the availability of and       capacity for Uyghur language programming on Radio Free Asia       in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region;        (6) the Federal Bureau of Investigation and appropriate       United States law enforcement agencies should take steps to       hold accountable officials from the People's Republic of       China or individuals acting on their behalf who harass,       threaten, or intimidate persons within the United States; and        (7) United States companies and individuals selling goods       or services or otherwise operating in Xinjiang Uyghur       Autonomous Region should take steps, including in any public       or financial filings, to ensure that--  [[Page H2294]]         (A) their commercial activities are not contributing to       human rights violations in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region       or elsewhere in China; and        (B) their supply chains are not compromised by forced       labor.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include in the Record extraneous material on S. 3744.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I should advise the House that we are taking up this  bill about 1\1/2\ hours earlier than expected, and I hope that our  colleagues from the Foreign Affairs Committee have changed their  schedule so that they can come to join us to speak on this bill.   Let me point out that even in a pandemic, the American Congress  focuses on human rights.   Madam Speaker, let me start by thanking our colleagues from both  sides of the aisle and both Chambers for their work on this  legislation. I especially want to thank Senators Rubio and Menendez,  and Representatives McGovern, Sherman, Smith, Suozzi, and others who  have worked for well more than a year, well more than 2 years in most  cases, to focus the world's attention on the deprivation of human  rights in Xinjiang province and to work for an appropriate American  response.   The Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act is the result of tireless work  from so many individuals who focus on human rights. We have seen the  reporting, the interviews, the pictures, the documentaries. The  evidence is overwhelming: The Chinese Government has brutally detained  and reeducated or sought to reeducate over 1 million Uyghurs and other  ethnic minorities, chiefly Muslim minorities, in the northwest of  China. It is horrific.   The goal of this inhumane campaign is clear: to force these  minorities to assimilate, to erase all evidence of their unique  language, culture, history, and religion.   Beijing has relied heavily on technology to carry out this abuse,  transforming the Uyghur region of Xinjiang into a surveillance state.  But even as the world has learned more and more about the extent of  these atrocities, there has been nowhere near enough action.   Beijing has leveraged its economic clout to silence criticism of its  horrific human rights abuses. So many countries, particularly Muslim  countries that always speak out when any group of Muslims is being  denied their human rights, have been pressured into silence. Now, China  wants the world to forget about the Uyghurs as we grapple with this  global pandemic.   We must push back. Today, we send a message loud and clear: We stand  with the Uyghurs. We will fight for the oppressed. And we will not  forget.   By passing the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act today, the United  States takes a meaningful step toward holding the perpetrators  accountable. This bill will impose sanctions on those individuals  responsible for human rights violations in Xinjiang. It also calls on  our government experts to issue reports that can improve our  understanding of the situation on the ground.   The persecution of the Uyghurs is one of the greatest human rights  tragedies currently taking place. We must stand on the right side of  history and respond decisively. This legislation is a critical step  forward, and I am proud to support its passage. I hope all Members of  this body will join me in that effort, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), chair of the Rules Committee, chair of  the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, co-chair of the Tom  Lantos Human Rights Commission, and a man who is known for his  dedication to human rights.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), a woman who has dedicated literally decades of  her life to fighting for human rights, particularly in China, the  distinguished Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Suozzi), an advocate for human and religious rights.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), an advocate for human rights.    Madam Speaker, having no further speakers, I yield  myself such time as I may consume for the purpose of closing.   The bill before us represents a number of different bills in the  Senate and the House, all of which have been blended together. All of  these bills contain important complementary measures to counter one of  the most important human rights violations of the present day,  detention of over 1 million Uyghurs and other Muslims in the Xinjiang  Province of China.   In particular, as chair of the Asia, the Pacific, and  Nonproliferation Subcommittee, back in February of last year, I joined  with our ranking member, Ted Yoho, and Congressman Connolly and  Congresswoman Wagner in introducing the Uighur Act. That legislation  added to this bill the imposition of sanctions on individuals and  entities found to have committed gross human rights abuses against  Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim minority  groups and other persons in the Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region.   This bill, I should point out, is not one that just expresses the  view of Congress; not one that just demands reports be issued by the  State Department to refocus the world on what is going with the Uyghurs  and others. This bill imposes sanctions on those responsible.   The Chinese Communist Party has sought to erase the distinct Uyghur  Muslim culture and religious traditions through mass detentions, re- education, and a coordinated campaign called ``Strike Hard Against  Violent Extremism'' launched in 2014. Thanks to leaked Chinese  Communist Party documents, we now know the impetus of this campaign  came from the highest levels of the party.   In April of 2014, General Secretary Xi Jinping ordered party  officials to show ``absolutely no mercy'' in using the ``organs of  dictatorship'' to suppress Muslim minorities. More than a million  Uyghurs have been imprisoned. And they have been imprisoned because, in  the words of the Chinese Communist Party, ``their thinking has been  infected by unhealthy thoughts.''   It appears, according to the Chinese Communist Party, a dedication to  religion or to freedom and democracy is unhealthy and justifies  incarceration.   Along with the re-education camps, the Strike Hard campaign has also  involved high-tech surveillance and monitoring of the Uyghurs,  monitoring and suppressing Muslim religious practice, including funeral  practices, and suppression of the Uyghur language.   And the party has acted beyond the borders of China, intimidating  Chinese Muslim minorities who are living abroad, preventing them,  including some who are permanent residents of the United States, from  leaving the Xinjiang region.    The legislation before us is an important start, but it is just a  start in our efforts to counter Chinese repression of its Muslim  minorities.   I think I have already highlighted the sanctions in this bill. In  particular, the bill requires the President to block assets of and deny  and revoke visas with respect to any foreign person, including a  Chinese Government official, who are determined to be responsible for  the suppression and inhumane treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim  minorities in Xinjiang Province.   So I want to thank Chairman Engel of the Foreign Affairs Committee,  who has put together the most bipartisan committee in either House of  Congress; Ranking Member McCaul, who has been an important part of  that; Speaker Pelosi, who spoke to us earlier; our colleagues Chris  Smith and  Tom Suozzi, who have spoken to us earlier as well; Senators  Marco Rubio and Robert Menendez; my colleague in running the Asia, the  Pacific, and Nonproliferation Subcommittee, Ted Yoho; as well as Gerry  Connolly, Ann Wagner, and everyone else who has been involved in the  legislation.   I hope that we will see Muslim countries particularly in the world-- but all countries--be willing to stand up to Beijing and speak out  against this human rights travesty.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
