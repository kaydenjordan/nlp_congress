 Mr. President, I listened to some of the remarks of the  distinguished Senator from Vermont and friend. I think we are both  trying to find a path forward to move our appropriations bill, but we  are not there yet.   This afternoon, I urge my colleagues to invoke cloture on the motion  to proceed to H.R. 2740, the first package of appropriations bills sent  over by the U.S. House of Representatives. This package includes the  Defense; Energy and Water; Labor, HHS, and Education; and State-Foreign  Operations appropriations bills.   My Democratic colleagues have said they are opposed to proceeding to  this package because we must pass domestic spending bills before we  pass the Defense bill, but this package before us right now does both.  In fact, it accounts for more than 40 percent of domestic spending. As  I said before, it mirrors the package sent to us by Speaker Pelosi and  the Democratic-controlled House. So this excuse, I believe, for  delaying consideration of this package doesn't hold water this  afternoon. We need to move the process forward.   I want to make a few points about the Senate versions of these bills  that we will bring up if we invoke cloture today.   Last week, the Appropriations Committee reported the Defense and  Energy and Water bills. The Energy and Water bill, as Senator Leahy has  just remarked, garnered unanimous support. My Democratic colleagues  similarly praised the bipartisan nature of the Defense bill. Yet they  voted against it in the committee. They did so because the bill, as I  understand it, from what they tell me, does not restrict the  President's ability to transfer funds to secure our southern border.   The terms of the bipartisan budget deal governed the fiscal year 2020  appropriations process. That is why they  [[Page S5561]]  entered into this agreement. They were agreed to by Republican and  Democratic leaders, all the way up to the President, the Speaker of the  House, the majority leader, the minority leader, and so forth. Those  terms expressly prohibit restrictions on the President's ability to  transfer funds. It is plain as day.   Our Democratic colleagues may now regret having agreed to those  terms, but that does not change the fact that they did agree to them,  and we want to go by them.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to place this term sheet into  the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Bipartisan Budget Agreement for Fiscal Years 2020 and 2021         1. The 2019 Bipartisan Budget Agreement for fiscal years       2020 and 2021 (``Agreement'') is agreed to by the bipartisan       leadership of Congress and the administration of Donald J.       Trump. The bipartisan Congressional leadership and the       administration agree to cooperate in the Agreement's       implementation.        2. The Agreement modifies the discretionary spending caps       imposed by the Budget Control Act (``BCA'') for fiscal years       2020 and 2021 pursuant to the table below. The spending cap       adjustments are intended to reflect the elimination of the       BCA sequester for two years, plus a slight increase in       spending for both defense and non-defense programs.        3. The parties agree to partially offset the Agreement's       modifications to the discretionary spending caps legislation       by extending the BCA mandatory sequester and customs user       fees to achieve a total offset level of $77.4 billion as       scored by the Congressional Budget Office.        4. The debt limit will be suspended for two years, through       July 31, 2021. No additional restrictions will be placed on       the Secretary's extraordinary measures authorities. The debt       limit suspension, spending cap adjustments, offsets, and any       necessary procedural matters, will be included as part of a       single piece of legislation.        5. Appropriations bills: Specific spending decisions shall       be left to the members of the Appropriations Committees, with       302(b)s set through the regular process of the committees.       Congressional leaders and the administration agree that,       relative to the FY 2019 regular appropriations Acts, there       will be no poison pills, additional new riders, additional       CHIMPS, or other changes in policy or conventions that allow       for higher spending levels, or any non-appropriations       measures unless agreed to on a bipartisan basis by the four       leaders with the approval of the President. Current transfer       funding levels and authorities shall be maintained, and any       modifications must be agreed to on a bipartisan basis by the       four leaders with the approval of the President. Any       emergency spending levels must be agreed to on a bipartisan       basis by the four leaders with the approval of the President.        6. The agreement also establishes a new cap adjustment for       FY 2020 to help ensure the necessary resources for the       decennial Census are provided.        7. Senate Leaders agree that if a bill has been reported on       a bipartisan basis from the Senate Appropriations Committee       and is consistent with the BCA spending caps, and has the       support of the Chairman and the Ranking Member, they will       work together to minimize procedural delays. The Majority       Leader will continue to consult with the Democratic Leader to       sequence bills in a bipartisan way, and acknowledges that       bipartisan concurrence is required to expedite the       consideration of any appropriations bill.        8. The President, Congressional leaders and the leadership       of the Appropriations Committees shall work together to reach       bicameral and bipartisan agreement on the orderly and timely       consideration of FY 2020 appropriations bills to avoid a       government shutdown, and a 12-bill omnibus. The President,       Congressional leaders and the leadership of the       Appropriations Committees shall also work together to reach       bicameral and bipartisan agreement on the orderly and timely       consideration of FY 2021 appropriations bills to avoid a       government shutdown, and a 12-bill omnibus.    Lack of adherence to the terms of the budget deal also  explains why we are unable to mark up the other two bills in this  package: Labor, HHS, and Education and State-Foreign Operations.   Just like the Defense and Energy and Water bills, these bills were  crafted in a bipartisan way. Yet some of my Democratic colleagues  threatened to amend these bills with abortion-related poison pills.   Poison pills, as we all know--just like restrictions on transfer  authority--are expressly--expressly--prohibited by the terms of the  budget deal that we all agreed to just a few weeks ago. Again, both  parties agreed to those terms.   Regardless, I am interested in moving the appropriations process  forward, and I believe Senator Leahy is too. I am interested in doing  so consistent with the budget agreement we agreed to.   That is why the chairman of the Labor-HHS and Senate Foreign  Operations Subcommittees, Senator Blunt and Senator Graham, have  released the versions of these bills that the Appropriations Committee  intended to consider last week.   Both bills were crafted with bipartisan input, and both are free of  poison pills. We are proud of the work that went into those bills and  want to be transparent about how we intend to proceed, but before we  vote on cloture, I want to remind my colleagues of our shared success  last year and our common interest in moving the process forward this  year.   In fiscal year 2019--last year--we achieved more success in passing  appropriations bills than we had done in 20 years. The linchpin of that  success was an agreement between me and Senator Leahy, the vice  chairman of the committee, to ban poison pills from appropriation  bills. Both sides upheld that agreement right here on the floor, and we  funded 75 percent of the government on time.   That is the framework the bipartisan budget deal was modeled after so  we could replicate what we did last year. The purpose of the budget  agreement is to replicate the success we had last year, as I just said,  to ensure that we do not revert to the dysfunctional appropriations  process of years past. That is why it is so important that we adhere to  it now. I think the American people want us to do it and do it now.   It is all the more important considering what we are trying to fund  with this package. It contains critical investments, not just in  health, education and energy projects but in national security, our  military.   I believe the situation unfolding in Saudi Arabia should serve as a  grave reminder to all of us that we must set aside partisan politics  and do our job to provide our military the resources it needs to keep  America safe. It should also remind us that our main adversaries--China  and Russia--never relent in their efforts to destabilize us anywhere in  the world. That is why we must do our part to ensure that they fail. We  cannot do that without stable funding for our military and for  certainty for our soldiers.   Failure to prioritize funding for our national defense would  undermine the Pentagon's planning process, hinder our commanders'  ability to counter threats to America, and threaten the safety of our  Nation. That is unacceptable.   We have the opportunity today to move forward together to bolster our  national security. We have a framework for success that we have used  last year. Let's use it now.   I hope my Democratic colleagues will recommit to the terms of the  budget deal that they agreed to in spirit and in fact. I hope they will  set aside partisan politics and do right by our military, the numerous  agencies that would receive funding in this package, and our  constituents--the American people--and let us get on with the business  of the people.   Again, this afternoon I urge my colleagues to vote yes on cloture.                                Cloture Motion
