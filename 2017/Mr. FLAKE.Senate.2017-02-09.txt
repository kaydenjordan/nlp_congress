 Mr. President, as I did last week, I rise again to support  the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve on the Supreme Court. As  we know, he is an accomplished, mainstream jurist, and he is a worthy  successor to Justice Antonin Scalia. I look forward to seeing him  receive an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. I truly hope that  happens.   After meeting with Judge Gorsuch and learning more about his judicial  philosophy, I continue to be impressed by his humble respect for the  law and his commitment to service. Before the hearings in the Judiciary  Committee, I wanted to take the opportunity to highlight one aspect of  his jurisprudence that I find particularly important: the separation of  powers.   To hear some of our friends on the other side of the aisle, Judge  Gorsuch represents two equal yet opposing dangers to the country.  First, they warn that he will lack any independence of thought or  commitment to the Constitution. They allege that he would serve merely  as a rubberstamp for President Trump and his agenda.   In the same breath, though, they claim he would engage in  unprecedented judicial oversight of the Federal executive agencies. In  other words, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle assert that  Judge Gorsuch would be both too deferential to Federal agencies and not  deferential enough.   The truth is, these warnings and accusations are entirely unfounded,  and they appear to be grounded more in political calculations than in  honest concern. For my part, I am excited about the prospect of  confirming a Justice who not only represents the separation of powers  but reveres it as one of the central principles of the Constitution.   A commitment to our constitutional separation of powers could not  come at a more crucial time, as executive branch agencies have  increasingly accumulated power and autonomy over the years. Both the  Congress and the Federal judiciary bear responsibility for this.   Legislatively, Congress simply cedes too much of its own lawmaking  power to the executive branch. We have been doing that for years. These  agencies have been legislating through Federal regulation. In turn,  Congress has allowed unelected bureaucrats to create law and determine  how that law should be implemented.   We have to stop this erosion of our article I power. Congress needs  to take ownership of its lawmaking authority and reverse this dangerous  trend toward governance by executive fiat. That is only part of the  equation. The Federal judiciary needs to use its constitutional  prerogative to rein in the executive branch.   Ever since the 1980s, Federal courts have grown far too deferential  to executive agencies. Under a doctrine known as Chevron deference, the  courts defer to agency decisions if it makes ``reasonable'' regulations  based on ``vague'' statutes.   In fact, this means that when the Federal courts consider an agency  decision, the judges have a new catchphrase: ``The agency is always  right.'' This should concern my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle who voiced strong concerns about rubberstamping.   I don't think the Founders ever intended for two constitutional  branches of our Federal Government to voluntarily cede the power to the  third. Importantly, neither does Judge Gorsuch. Judge Gorsuch has  written extensively both about delegation and deference in his role as  judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.   He addressed the issue of delegation in a recent case called Caring  Hearts Personal Home Services, Inc. v. Burwell. In it, he noted:         Executive agencies today are permitted not only to enforce       legislation, but to revise  [[Page S982]]       and reshape it through exercise of so-called ``delegated''       legislative authority.    He continued:         The number of formal rules these agencies have issued,       thanks to their delegated legislative authority, has grown so       exuberantly, it's hard to keep up. The Code of Federal       Regulations now clocks in at over 175,000 pages.    He noted that delegation presents both separation of powers problems  and due process problems. The reason is simple. The executive is doing  the work of the legislature.   In terms of due process, Judge Gorsuch wondered ``whether and how  people can be fairly expected to keep pace with and conform their  conduct to all this churning and changing `law.' ''   He further questioned: ``What happens if we reach the point where  even these legitimate legislating agencies don't know what their own  `law' is?''   Judge Gorsuch could not be more correct. With tens of thousands of  pages published in the Federal Register every year, it is fair to  wonder how any agency can be certain of the legal effect of its own  rules. If the agencies that write these laws can't keep track of them,  how can a small business owner in Arizona be expected to comply with  the litany of ever-changing rules written by unelected bureaucrats?   Judge Gorsuch has also discussed the problem of deference and  explained the proper relationship between Federal agencies and the  judiciary. In his concurring opinion, in Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch,  Judge Gorsuch explained:         In enlightenment theory and hard won experience under a       tyrannical king, the founders found proof of the wisdom of a       government of separated powers.    He continued:         The founders considered the separation of powers a vital       guard against governmental encroachment on the people's       liberties, including all those later enumerated in the Bill       of Rights.    Judge Gorsuch found Chevron deference inconsistent with this  constitutional framework, which he called ``no less than a judge-made  doctrine for the abdication of the judicial duty.''   He concluded:         We managed to live with the administrative state before       Chevron. We could do it again. Put simply, it seems to me       that in a world without Chevron, very little would change--      except perhaps the most important things.    The separation of powers is the most important feature of our  constitutional system of government. When each branch of government  serves as a check on the other, it fosters a more deliberative,  judicious, and limited form of governance. As someone who embraces  limited government, it is a privilege to support and confirm a judge  like Neil Gorsuch who supports this philosophy.   As I have said before, and I will say again, Judge Gorsuch deserves  fair consideration by those who serve in this body, and he deserves an  up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. When he receives that vote, he  will be confirmed overwhelmingly.   I yield back the remainder of my time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from Illinois.
