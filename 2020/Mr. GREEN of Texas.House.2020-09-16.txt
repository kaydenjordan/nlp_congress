 Mr. Speaker, as the grandson of a Methodist  preacher, and I would also add, whose wife--my grandmother--was a  missionary, I am proud to rise today to present H. Res. 1090,  recognizing Islam as one of the great religions of the world.   I am proud to acknowledge that this resolution was introduced on  August 21, 2020, with three original cosponsors: The honorable Rashida  Tlaib, the honorable Ilhan Omar, and my friend who is with me today,  the honorable Andre Carson.   I will say much more about the resolution, but I do want to at this  time acknowledge my friend who's present from the Seventh Congressional  District of Indiana.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson), a  wordsmith par excellence.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his very  kind words. He is more than generous. I also thank him for his service  in Congress.   He and I started out together on the Financial Services Committee. He  has since moved on to the Intelligence Committee and is doing an  outstanding job serving his country as an American Muslim.   Mr. Speaker, I indicated that I am the grandson of a Methodist  preacher, but I am also a very proud Baptist. My grandfather would not  hold it against me.   Religion is something that each person has to make decisions about  for himself or herself. It is not something that we impose on people.  This is a free country, a country wherein you have the right to be  whatever you choose to be, within the spirit of what the law allows.   This is the case with religion. You can be whatever you choose to be,  be associated with whichever religion you choose to, within the spirit  of what the law allows.   I want to just say a few words about why I have brought this  resolution. I have lived in this country all of my life. I love my  country. It means something to me. I respect the words ``liberty and  justice for all'' in the Pledge of Allegiance. I respect the concept in  the Gettysburg Address: ``government of the people, by the people, for  the people.''   It means something to me to know that a person who came from what I  consider humble beginnings has had the opportunity to stand in the well  of the House of Representatives. So, I love my country.   But it doesn't mean that I overlook some of the things that have  happened to me along life's way that were not so pleasant.   I had persons who called themselves Christians to burn a cross in my  yard. I don't consider them Christians. They called themselves  Christians.   I have had persons who called themselves Christians to say some very  ugly things to me and do some very ugly things to me.   But let me tell you what it did not do to me. Those persons who wore  the hoods, who came to my yard, burned the cross, it did not cause me  to conclude that Christianity was represented in what they did. The  people who said ugly things and did ugly things to me in the name of  Christianity, they did not cause me to conclude that that is what  Christianity is all about.    I am mentioning this because, quite candidly, I want other people to  understand that Islam is a peaceful religion, that there are people who  abuse others in the name of religion, but that doesn't mean that the  religion is about the abuse that is being perpetrated.   I am honored today to present this resolution, and I rise in  solidarity with my Muslim brothers and sisters around the world. I do  so because I have seen them in action.   In Houston, Texas, we have storms. When these storms have come  through our city--Hurricane Harvey being one example--the Muslim  community was right there to do all that was necessary to help others.   One of the greatest callings that you have in any religion is to help  somebody. They have adhered to the call for justice. They have been  there to march in protest for freedom and justice for other people.   This community has been there with aid and comfort for people who  have been left homeless. They have been there with aid and comfort for  people who have suffered harm by way of their physical well-being.   Muslim doctors have helped people, and I have seen the evidence of  it. There is a clinic in Houston, the Ibn Sina Clinic, and they have  been assisting people with the COVID virus. Free tests are being  administered.   This community has been helpful in my city. Persons from the  community have served in public office, on city council. We have  persons who are serving as precinct judges.   The community is there and a part of the greater Houston community.  Houston is a very diverse city. The Muslim community enhances the  diversity of the city of Houston.   This religion is a complete system of strong moral convictions that  promotes peace, equality, and social justice. Islam is the second  largest and fastest growing religion in the world.   America is home to one of the most diverse Muslim populations. It has  within it almost every ethnicity, country, and school of thought. There  are approximately 3.45 million Muslims of all ages living in the United  States of America. This is as of 2016; this is the last information  available to me.   In an overwhelming measure, Muslims make a significant, positive, and  growing contribution to our Nation. We have successful Muslims in all  areas of our national life. Names that come to mind, for a good many  Americans, would include Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, would include one who was  known as Cassius Clay but became Muhammad Ali. There are Muslims in all  areas of life, including business, sport, media, culture, medicine,  law, and politics.   Although American Muslims make up approximately 1 percent of the U.S.  population, most Americans can name some of these prominent Muslims  that I have called to your attention.   Another is Malcolm X. Many persons don't revere Malcolm X, but I am  proud to say that the United States of America has had Malcolm X on a  postage stamp. Of course, his name moved from X to Shabazz.   The Nation has honored many American Muslims for their service and  sacrifice, including Salman Hamdani. Mr. Hamdani was there for 9/11. He  made sacrifices on 9/11 as a first responder.   Many American Muslims are also civically engaged, working with their  neighbors to better their communities. They are members of the Rotary  Club, the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Yes, Muslims served in the military  of the United States of America.   They are members of school boards, and they volunteer in our  communities. They actively engage in charitable giving. And I say this  with some understanding of it, as I have seen it in action. I have seen  the Muslim community not only give their in-kind services but their  American dollars to worthy causes.   In short, American Muslims and the organizations they create are a  part of the fiber and fabric of the great country that I love.   Today, during this pandemic, many Muslims work on the front lines, as  was said by my dear brother, Andre Carson, Congressman Carson. They  work on the front lines. They work as essential workers. They put their  lives on the line to help others through the pain of the pandemic.   I believe that we must acknowledge and appreciate that Muslims  further the diversity and success of our great country.                                time  1630    To this end, I trust that persons will join me in demonstrating  solidarity with and support for Muslim members of the community  throughout the world by recognizing Islam as one of the great religions  of the world.   I hold in my hand the actual resolution that has been filed. I will  not go through the whereases, but I do want to go to the be it  resolved: `` . . . be it resolved . . . to demonstrate solidarity and  support for members of the community of Islam in the United States and  throughout the world, the House of Representatives recognizes the  Islamic faith as one of the great religions of the world.''   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the time, but I also want to thank the  House leadership for the time. I do so because there was a time in the  history of this country when a person who was born into poverty, who  had to suffer the slings and arrows of invidious discrimination, would  not be allowed to stand in the House of Representatives and present a  resolution honoring Islam. We have come a long way.   I would like to acknowledge the fact that we have come a long way,  because too many proclaim the notion that nothing has changed. The mere  fact that I am standing here bringing this resolution means that things  have changed. Many may not agree, but things have changed to the extent  that  [[Page H4478]]  I have got the freedom to speak my mind with this resolution on the  floor of the House of Representatives.   So I thank all of the leadership for acknowledging the change and  allowing the resolution to be presented. With this said, I kindly and  respectfully yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
