 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 542. This bill  authorizes the National Urban Security Technology Laboratory in New  York City, a one-of-its-kind testing lab for first responders.   The NUSTL evaluates and validates emerging technologies for use by  first responders. Their work provides valuable information to first  responders to increase their ability to save lives and property as  departments across the Nation respond to incidents.   H.R. 542 will ensure that the National Urban Security Technology  Laboratory's work will continue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  legislation. I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance  of my time.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 542 represents a bipartisan effort to support the  needs of State and local first responders. It is critical that the  Federal Government have the capacity to develop, test, and transition  the best new technologies to the first responder community.   It bears repeating that NUSTL is the only Federal lab in the country  that is focused entirely on helping first responders carry out their  mission.   As the tactics and weapons of terrorists evolve, NUSTL will continue  to play a key role in ensuring that our first responders are not just  prepared but that they remain one step ahead.   Mr. Speaker, before I close, I would note that a similar version of  this bill passed the House in June 2018 by a voice vote. I would ask my  colleagues to pass it again today and send it to the Senate, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2476, the Securing  American Nonprofit Organizations Act of 2019.   The Nonprofit Security Grant Program provides critical funding to  harden security at houses of worship, community centers, schools, and  other cultural institutions located in Urban Area Security Initiative,  or UASI, regions.   This legislation expands the grant program so eligible entities not  within UASI regions can also apply. These grants are used for target- hardening activities and physical security upgrades as well as for  necessary security training.   The unfortunate reality is that threats to religious institutions and  other soft targets are not going away and, in fact, are increasing at  an alarming rate.   There have been a number of attacks, both overseas and in the United  States, at places of worship. It is a stark reminder of the continued  threat.   The Nonprofit Security Grant Program assists the most at-risk  organizations in hardening their defenses, while allowing them to  remain focused on providing services and counsel in their communities.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to  do so. I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, as the threats to our homeland  continue to evolve, we must be prepared to face the new and emerging  challenges they present.   H.R. 2476 would authorize DHS to continue assisting nonprofit  organizations across the country with protecting their members and  their buildings.   A version of this bill passed the House by a voice vote in the last  Congress, and I hope my colleagues will do the same again today.   H.R. 2476 was also endorsed by the Jewish Federations of North  America. I truly appreciate their partnership and collaboration around  this critical Homeland Security program, and I include in the Record  their letter of support.                                             The Jewish Federations                                                of North America,                                                        May 9, 2019.      Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Michael Dennis Rogers,      Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member Rogers: We       commend you for scheduling the mark-up of H.R. 2476, the       ``Securing American Non-Profit Organizations Against       Terrorism Act of 2019'', and respectfully urge Members of the       Committee to support the bill.        On April 27, 2019, white supremacist John Earnest allegedly       entered the Chabad of Poway synagogue, near San Diego, CA,       during Passover services, and murdered Lori Kaye, 60, and       attempted to murder Noya Dahan, 8, Almog Peretz, 34, and       Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein, 57. On October 27, 2018, white       supremacist Robert D. Bowers allegedly entered the Tree of       Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, PA, during Sabbath services,       and murdered 11 congregants and wounded six others, including       four police officers. In the months between these deadly       attacks, the FBI has brought charges against would-be       terrorists and violent homegrown extremists for plots and       threats against synagogues, Jewish community centers,       mosques, Islamic centers, and churches located in Washington,       DC, New York, California, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Montana,       Florida, Ohio, Texas, Kansas, Oregon and Pennsylvania.        Over the past year, the FBI has investigated more than 100       threats to religious institutions. As recently as January       2019, the Federal Government released a Joint Intelligence       Bulletin that assesses that domestic actors will continue to       pose a lethal threat to faith-based communities in the       Homeland. The JIB advises government counterterrorism and law       enforcement officials and private sector security partners       responsible for securing faith-based communities to remain       vigilant in light of the enduring threat to faith-based       communities posed by US-based threat actors and homegrown       violent extremists. The JIB also warns of the difficulty in       detecting domestic terrorists and extremists because of the       individualized nature of their radicalization to violence.       (Source: Joint Intelligence Bulletin IA-32337-19, February       22, 2019)        In previous reports, the Department of Homeland Security       has found that faith-based organizations are at particular       risk of attack because of the significant number of people of       like faith that gather together in a single symbolic location       at specified times; the organizations typically have       unrestricted access to their religious services and       peripheral areas such as their parking areas and education       facilities; and because these organizations most likely have       limited resources for security as nonprofit institutions. As       ``soft targets'', DHS has further assessed that these       organizations are particularly vulnerable to bombing, arson       attack, small arms attack, assassination and kidnapping, and       chemical/biological/radiological attack. To counter these       threats and vulnerabilities, DHS recommends that faith-based       organizations take a number of key protective measures       against threats and to mitigate the effects of an attack,       including: installation of target hardening equipment,       engaging in planning and preparedness activities and the       acquisition of security personnel.        Recognizing that many nonprofits do not have the financial       resources to implement extensive security measures, the       ``Securing American Non-Profit Organizations Against       Terrorism Act of 2019'' provides critical support for       security related activities to nonprofit organizations at       risk of a terrorist attack that are recommended by the       Department of Homeland Security. These include support for:        Physical Security Enhancements, such as access controls,       blast proofing, surveillance, fencing and bollards;        Security Training of employees and organization members and       volunteers;        Exercises, such as those that validate plans and       procedures, evaluate capabilities, and assess progress toward       meeting capability targets;        Planning, such as the development and enhancement of       security plans and protocols, emergency contingency plans, or       evacuation/shelter-in-place plans; and        Contracting of Security Personnel and off-duty police       officers.  [[Page H4367]]         In consideration of the substantial threats and attacks to       nonprofit institutions by domestic and foreign terrorists and       violent homegrown extremists, the vulnerability of nonprofits       to destruction, incapacitation, or exploitation from a       terrorist attack, and the challenges nonprofits face in       providing for needed investments in target hardening and       related preparedness activities, The Jewish Federations       respectfully urges the Members of the Committee to support       the ``Securing American Non-Profit Organizations Against       Terrorism Act of 2019'' at markup.            Sincerely,                                                Robert B. Goldberg,                              Senior Director, Legislative Affairs.    Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my  colleagues to support H.R. 2476, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 1158, the DHS Cyber Incident Response  Teams Act of 2019.   H.R. 1158 authorizes cyber hunt and incident response teams to assist  operators, free of cost, to identify unauthorized cyber activity while  promoting the proper strategies to deter future threats.   This legislation helps us stay vigilant in our efforts to respond to  cyber incidents in both the public and private sectors as threats to  our digital networks continue to evolve.   I support this important bill, introduced by my colleague, Ranking  Member McCaul, and I commend him for his leadership on this issue. I  urge all Members to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I am  prepared to close after the gentleman from Texas closes.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. McCaul).    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   It is hard to predict the future, but there is one thing I know: Our  adversaries will continue to hone their hacking capabilities to advance  their interests and undermine ours.   Critical infrastructure owners and operators must have access to the  incident response capabilities necessary to protect their networks.  H.R. 1158, which was approved unanimously in committee, will help  ensure that DHS can continue to partner effectively with the private  sector to protect critical infrastructure.   Before I close, I would like to note that a version of this bill  passed the House by a voice vote in the 115th Congress. I urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 1158.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 2539, the Strengthening Local  Transportation Security Capabilities Act of 2019. This bill will  provide important support to surface transportation security at a time  when our transportation sector faces evolving threats.   This bill ensures that the Secretary of Homeland Security will  prioritize the assignment of intelligence analysts to fusion centers in  areas with high-risk surface transportation assets to bolster security,  improve coordination, and enhance information sharing.   This bill underscores the critically important work of State, local,  and regional fusion centers in protecting the homeland. These centers  analyze current threats and push critical threat information to the  front lines.   It is important that Congress pass bills like this to strengthen the  relationships among Federal, State, and local jurisdictions so that  relevant threat information reaches the right people in a timely  manner.   I am pleased by the support of my Democratic colleagues for fusion  centers and hope this will lead to quick  [[Page H4370]]  passage of another bill, introduced by Homeland Security Committee  Ranking Member Rogers, H.R. 480, the Homeland Threat Assessment Act.   Keeping transportation systems secure is part and parcel to  protecting the American way of life and keeping America moving forward.  I commend this legislation for raising the baseline on how the  Department of Homeland Security supports the security of surface  transportation systems, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I am  prepared to close after the gentleman from Texas closes.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   H.R. 2539 would be an important step toward securing some of our  country's most important transportation systems.   DHS is faced with an enormous challenge of combating the constantly  evolving threats facing our Nation's transportation systems. Timely  information sharing about these systems is essential to counter any  threat.   Last Congress, a similar measure passed the House with wide  bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2083.   This bill will encourage the Department of Homeland Security to  purchase uniforms and protective gear for its law enforcement officers  from ethical manufacturers and sellers. To do business with DHS,  contractors that supply frontline operational components must abide by  the code of business ethics, the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and  any quality control standards deemed appropriate by the Secretary.  These conditions will ensure that we are purchasing the very best  products for our men and women on the front lines.   The bill also protects the security of DHS law enforcement personnel  by requiring that uniforms and equipment that bear a law enforcement  insignia be properly stored and disposed of if they are unusable. This  will help prevent law enforcement badges and patches from falling into  the wrong hands or being used for nefarious purposes.   H.R. 2083 will also help to promote small businesses by encouraging  the Secretary of DHS to utilize small businesses for at least one-third  of DHS uniform needs. Small businesses are the backbone of America, and  this bill will help to ensure that the Secretary considers them for the  agency's needs whenever possible.   H.R. 2083 requires that the Secretary purchase uniforms at a fair and  reasonable price.   Further, the bill requires a study on the adequacy of uniform  allowances to ensure that DHS law enforcement personnel do not have to  pay out of pocket for the basic items they need to carry out their  duties.   Mr. Speaker, this bill goes a long way toward improving the process  for procurement of uniforms for DHS personnel, and I urge my colleagues  to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 2609, the DHS  Acquisition Review Board Act of 2019.   The Government Accountability Office and the Department of Homeland  Security Office of Inspector General have both identified weaknesses in  the Department's management of its major acquisition programs. Poor  management of these programs costs the Department billions of dollars  each year.   GAO has placed DHS management functions, including acquisition  management, on its ``High Risk List,'' programs that are highly  susceptible to fraud, waste, abuse, or mismanagement or are in need of  transformation.   The Department struggles to ensure that major acquisitions are  delivered on schedule, provide the capabilities needed, and do not  exceed budget. In recent years, GAO has identified 9 out of 26 major  acquisition programs that experienced cost growth or schedule slips.  Cost overruns totaled $988 million, and schedules frequently slipped by  an average of 6 months.   GAO also determined that approximately half of major acquisition  programs deployed capabilities before all key performance parameters  had been met.   It is essential that DHS establish better management tools to provide  accountability in its major acquisition programs and ensure that  problems are identified and addressed early.   My bill requires DHS to establish mechanisms for accountability to  better manage components' major acquisition programs by establishing an  Acquisition Review Board within DHS. The board would oversee DHS'  acquisition process, review major acquisition programs, and evaluate  the use of best practices.   The Under Secretary for Management will serve as the chair of the  board, and the board would be required to meet regularly. The board  would be responsible for determining if a proposed acquisition has met  planning requirements necessary to move into the production and  deployment phases.   It would also oversee a major acquisitions business strategy. The  board will review the cost tradeoffs, schedules, and performance  objectives of the programs.   As we seek to ensure the homeland is protected and DHS has the  resources it needs to do its job, we must also ensure that taxpayer  dollars are being spent efficiently and effectively.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2609, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
