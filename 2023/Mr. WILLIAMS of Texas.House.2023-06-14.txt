 Madam Speaker, I rise today because we are  witnessing yet another attack on the Constitution by President Biden.   As of June 1, due to the reclassification of firearms attached with  stabilizing braces, millions of law-abiding Americans are at risk of  prosecution by the Federal Government at a time in which trust in the  justice system is at an all-time low.   There is no evidence that this rule would make Americans safer. In  fact, it makes it more difficult to obtain a safety attachment, putting  more lives at risk.   Historically, stabilizing braces were designed for disabled veterans,  allowing them to safely participate in recreational shooting.   This is not just a threat to our rights but a direct attack on our  veterans, who have selflessly put their lives on the line to protect  this great country.   We have seen time and time again that, first, they come for your  guns, and then, they come for everything else.   I am proud to have cosponsored this legislation to defend our God- given rights.   Under President Biden, Federal agencies such as the ATF have acted as  lawmakers through the introduction of new rules and regulations.   Madam Speaker, it is time to rein in the President and bring  lawmaking back to the people's House. I urge all of my colleagues to  support this important piece of legislation. The future of America  depends on you.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
