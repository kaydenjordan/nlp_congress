 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 9,  the Climate Action Now Act, that is laid before this House now for  final consideration.   ``The Earth's climate is now changing faster than at any point in the  history of modern civilization.'' This is a direct quote from the  Fourth National Climate Assessment issued by our top scientists from  across 13 government agencies.   Sea levels are rising; average temperatures are warming; ice is  disappearing; and extreme weather is intensifying and becoming more  frequent. And we know that in this Chamber, because we are dealing with  the consequences of the hurricanes, the fires, too often because of our  constituents that are being hurt.   We know this is affecting the lives of growing numbers of Americans  all across the country. And even as I stand here, right now, we have  floods in my district.   Climate change is an urgent, existential threat we all face, and bold  action is demanded at this moment. We have to act together, not as  Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans.   We don't change treaties. We don't change things because we have had  a change in who has been elected President. We respect that office. The  consequences of inaction are real, and not only are future generations  put at risk each day if we do nothing, so are we.   This begins by ensuring America honors its commitment under the Paris  Agreement. Withdrawing is not the answer.   The Climate Action Now Act would simply prevent the United States  from using Federal dollars to withdraw from the Paris Agreement; and  calls on the President to develop and make public a plan for how the  United States will meet its nationally-determined contributions  submitted to the world in 2015.   The bill is technology-neutral, so the President has the flexibility  to set climate policies and marshal renewable forms of energy. I urge  my colleagues to support this bill.
