 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise in support  of the rule and in support of the underlying resolution, H. Res. 789.  This is an extraordinary measure, and I do not support it lightly.   As chair of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, I support and  defend the rights of all committee members to express their views, even  if I disagree with them. But the honest exchange of ideas cannot happen  when one committee member promotes violence against another.   No other workplace in America would tolerate such dangerous conduct,  and neither should the House of Representatives.   What Representative Gosar did is both despicable and beneath the  office he holds. But make no mistake about it: Promoting political  violence has real consequences.   Many of our colleagues, including myself, and the Capitol Police have  received credible death threats.   Rejecting violence should not be a partisan issue. I call on my  Republican colleagues to join us today in demanding accountability for  those who promote it.
