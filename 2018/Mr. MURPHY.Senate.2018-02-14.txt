 Mr. President, as we speak, there is a horrific scene  playing  [[Page S949]]  out in a high school in South Florida. Turn on your television right  now, and you will see scenes of children running for their lives--what  looks to be the 19th school shooting in this country, and we have not  even hit March.   I am coming to the floor to talk about something else, but let me  note once again for my colleagues that this happens nowhere else other  than the United States of America, this epidemic of mass slaughter,  this scourge of school shooting after school shooting. It only happens  here, not because of coincidence, not because of bad luck, but as a  consequence of our inaction. We are responsible for the level of mass  atrocity that happens in this country with zero parallel anywhere else.   As a parent, it scares me to death that this body doesn't take  seriously the safety of my children, and it seems as though a lot of  parents in South Florida are going to be asking that same question  later today.   We pray for the families and for the victims. We hope for the best.   Mr. President, I came to the floor today to talk about immigration. I  want to make a specific case to you today, but before I do, I want to  talk a little about process.   I heard a lot of my friends on the Republican side of the aisle say  on this floor and in the Halls of Congress that President Trump has  made an immigration proposal and Democrats have been asking for an  immigration proposal, so we should just accept his first and only  offer. What is the big deal? President Trump gave you something that  says ``immigration'' on it. Why aren't you accepting it?   It is a terrible proposal. It is bad for America. To his credit,  President Trump does attempt to try to deal with these Dreamer kids,  but there are 3 million potentially eligible individuals in this  country, and it only allows about 1.8 million of them to get through  the process.   But that is really not the worst part. The worst part is that it cuts  legal immigration by 40 percent. It basically abandons this country's  commitment to family-based immigration. I wouldn't be here if we only  had skills-based immigration. Most Members of this body wouldn't be  here if the only way that your parents or grandparents or great- grandparents could have come here is because of a Ph.D. or a degree or  a certificate. Most of the people in this Chamber, I would imagine, are  here because their parents or great-grandparents or great-great- grandparents came here because they had friends or family here. Let's  not reimagine the history of this country.   Democrats aren't obligated to accept the first offer from this  President if it is not good for America. Negotiation still has to be  part of the legislative process, and I am glad there are Members of the  Republican and Democratic caucuses who have been trying to do that. We  will see where that goes.   The President has put this proposal on the table that dramatically  cuts immigration into this country because he sees immigration as a  core weakness of this country. He views new entrants to America as an  economic drain. That is why he wants to potentially kick out 3 million  Dreamer kids next month if we don't act. That is why he wants to  dramatically cut down the number of people who are allowed to legally  immigrate to America. He views immigrants as a problem that needs to be  dealt with. And he is not alone. Many Americans agree. I, frankly, hear  from them regularly in Connecticut.   Frankly, one could also argue that there is nothing more American  than being scared of immigrants. Every single new wave of immigrants to  our shores has been met with some degree of fear and derision and  prejudice. Like clockwork, every generation or two, American  politicians denounce immigrants as a threat to the American-born  worker.   In the 1850s, growing numbers of Catholic immigrants from Ireland--as  the Murphys came--and from Germany led to an anti-immigrant party  arising in this country that elected more than 100 Congressmen, eight  Governors, and thousands of local politicians. They claimed that  Catholics could never be Americans because they owed allegiance to the  Pope.   Starting in the 1880s, hundreds of thousands of Chinese immigrants  began to immigrate to the west coast, causing a spike in anti-Chinese  sentiment that eventually resulted in the passage of something called  the Chinese Exclusion Act.   Fearing those who are different from us in skin color or religion or  national origin or language is an unmistakable facet of American  history, but over and over again, we have overcome these base instincts  because our better angels prevail but also because of this bright,  straight line that connects America's liberal immigration policy with  our economic greatness.   I want to take just a couple of minutes to make for you a compact but  irrefutable case for the correlation between economic power and  American immigrants.   From 1870 to 1910, it is no coincidence that America's transformation  into a global economic powerhouse occurred during a period of massive  influx of human capital. During that time, nearly 15 percent of all  Americans were foreign-born. That is a share that our country has never  reached since then. This period of unprecedented growth forever  dispelled the myth that we still labor under today that the number of  American jobs is fixed. Immigrants increase demand, and that increased  demand creates jobs.    Organizations from the National Academy of Sciences to the  conservative Cato Institute have done their own studies on this  question and have come to the same conclusion.   Cato recently said this:         Immigrants add jobs, in part by raising consumer demand. So       getting rid of immigrants, such as by deporting unauthorized       workers, would most likely destroy jobs and raise native       unemployment.    That makes sense, right? But if you don't believe that immigrants  create growth, there is another, even simpler explanation as to why we  need robust immigration. At present birth rates, we don't have enough  people born here to fill all the jobs that are going to be created in  the next 20 years. It is estimated that, accounting for growth, America  is going to need 83 million new workers to enter the workforce in the  next 20 years. But here is the problem. Only 51 million new workers  will be native-born. That leaves us 32 million short. Unless folks  start churning out a lot more babies, immigration is the only way to  fix that deficit.   Not convinced? Well, think about how the Federal budget works. Most  of our budget is social insurance--working-age Americans paying into  accounts that pay benefits to older, nonworking Americans. You need a  balance between the two in order to not go bankrupt. Many of our  competitor nations around the world are spiraling toward this  demographic cataclysm. By 2030, the median age in Japan, with strict  immigration policies, is going to be over 50. It is extraordinary. Do  you want to know why Germany is so interested in bringing refugees into  their country? Because without them, their median age in 2030 will be  48. Budgets simply can't work with that many retirees and that few  workers. Because of America's liberal immigration policy, our average  age, which today is 38, will increase in 2030 to just 39. During that  time, China--another country that doesn't really allow immigration-- will go from having a median age that is 2 years younger than that of  the United States to 3 years older.   In 2010, undocumented immigrants and their employers sent $13 billion  to Social Security. Without them, the trust fund would be out of money  today.   You are not there yet? Let's talk jobs. Just ask your farmers in your  State how important lower skilled immigration is to keeping their farms  afloat. But let's talk about high-skilled jobs. Would it shock you to  know that 31 percent of Ph.D. holders in this country are immigrants?  It is amazing. And more than one-quarter of all high-quality patents in  the United States are being granted to immigrants.   How about a study from 3 years ago that Senator Cortez Masto referred  to that found that immigrants are twice as likely as native-born  Americans to start a business. That is not good enough for you? Here is  a mind blower: 43 percent of Fortune 500 companies in the United States  were founded or cofounded by an immigrant or a child of an immigrant.  You know who they are. The founder of eBay came to the United States  from France, where he was born to Iranian parents. Google's cofounder,  Sergey Brin, emigrated with his family from Russia when he was 6.  [[Page S950]]  Elon Musk, who started SpaceX, which has 4,000 employees, came from  South Africa. Daniel Aaron, who cofounded Comcast, was a refugee of  Nazi Germany. Henry Ford was an Irish immigrant. Estee Lauder's family  was Hungarian. Herman Hollerith, one of the founders of IBM, had German  parents. You don't want Ford or IBM or Google to be part of the  American story? Then keep saying immigrants are an economic drain.   Margaret Thatcher once marveled of America: ``No other nation has so  successfully combined people of different races and nations within a  single culture.'' This combination is our definition as a nation, but  it is also the story of our economic greatness, of our sprawling leap  in under two short centuries from an idea to the biggest, most dynamic  economy on the face of the planet. To deny that history or to  misremember it would be perhaps an irreversible error.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.
