 Mr. President, as my friend from Connecticut has  pointed out, there are----    Oh, my goodness, my soul.   Mr. President, may I strike that erroneous introduction?    I thank my dear friend from Delaware--always  Delaware--but truly a friend; a friend on many different issues, but a  man whom I have come to know is motivated not by the politics of what  goes on in this body but by the passion and his interest in doing good,  doing good policy and doing good things for people.   And what we are speaking to today, recognizing the significant  passage of the ACT for ALS Act that happened last evening unanimously,  as he has pointed out, that this is not only good for the body, if you  will, to say we were able to move good legislation forward, good policy  legislation forward, but this is a gift. This is a gift of hope for  those who live with ALS, for those families who are part of that  journey of those who live with ALS.   ALS, as Senator Coons has noted, is an awful, awful disease. Some  would suggest, and I certainly would, that it is probably the worst  disease to be afflicted with, when your body literally closes in on you  while your mind is still active and vibrant.   I have a very personal connection to ALS. I think many of us have  very personal connections to ALS. I wish that we didn't have these  personal connections to this hideous disease, but we do, and that  connection allows us to learn and understand a little bit more about  it.   And I think the most heartbreaking thing that I realized, when my  family member was diagnosed with ALS, my cousin's husband, was that  there was no treatment. There was no hope. There was no hope.   I am not suggesting that the ACT for ALS is the end-all be-all. I  wish that we could stand here and say that. It is not, but what it is,  is a glimmer of hope.   I want to read just a couple sentences from an email that I received  last evening when I was able to share this good news that this bill was  passing unanimously through this body, and my cousin Jen says:         The passage of this bill will bring real, tangible hope to       people living with ALS and those to be diagnosed. In this ALS       world, right now, there are no effective treatments. All we       have is hope. This bill changes everything. It will bring       real, tangible hope and treatments to people living with ALS.       We have never had that in this disease.    We haven't found the cure, we haven't found the treatment, but what  we are providing today is that first step forward, a tangible step  forward to the hope, because every day--every day--those who are living  with ALS and their loved ones, who live through this disease with them,  have to hope and pray every single day that today is going to be the  day. Today is going to be the day that we can slow this, that we can  halt this.   There are some extraordinary heroes that have been involved with this  fight over the years. They are everyday people. They got into it not  because they were paid lobbyists. Most of them got into it because they  had lived through ALS. They had lost a loved one to this disease, and  rather than to give up and give in and be too tired to carry on, they  said: I am going to commit so that no other families have to feel this  helplessness.   And so you have got some amazing people. You have got a group out  there, the I AM ALS team--extraordinary, extraordinary advocates.   Senator Coons has mentioned Brian Wallach and Dan Tate. The two of  them lead I AM ALS. You have got Megan Miller, Deb Paust, Sandy Morris,  Christa Thompson, Nicole Cimbura, Becky Mourey, Michael Lecker, Shelly  Hoover, Michelle Lorenz, Mayuri and Mayank Saxena--so many, so many  more who were part of that effort.   The I AM ALS organization, working with the ALS Association, working  with the Muscular Dystrophy Association and so many others were so  critical in moving this forward. Think about what happened.   This was introduced over here in the Senate. We looked this up. It  was May 25. May 25. And to get over 60 cosponsors in the U.S. Senate on  any kind of a measure--I wish that the Senator from Delaware and I  could say that we single-handedly got every single one of those  cosponsors, but it was these advocates. It was these grassroots  individuals. It was everybody that I just named--Dan and Megan and  Jenny and Deb and Sandy, who made these calls, who were relentless.   And when the politics did intervene, they were unleashed and  passionate in their advocacy. And I think this is a good lesson to us,  that when those who are intimately and passionately involved, that you  can make a difference, you can move legislation. You can move  mountains.   The last thing I want to say before I turn back to my colleague here  is that there are a lot of people who are not part of an organization  but who have just felt compelled to speak up.   We heard voices from around my State: Marcel from Sitka; Douglas from  Anchorage; a gentleman by the name of Mike, also from Anchorage. The  calls, the letters, the emails that we got--I know all of our  colleagues received the same as well.   So this, again, was an effort that was so personal to so many, but  the leadership that I think we saw come together with Brian Wallach,  his wife Sandra--  [[Page S9281]]  they were the founders there of I AM ALS.   Brian was only 37 years old when he was diagnosed with ALS--37--so  super young. And he was told 6 months: You have got 6 months to live.   He is a father to two little girls, and he just said: Got to keep  fighting. We have got to keep fighting for a cure--a cure that will  allow him to raise his daughters with his wife.   And I think it is fair to say that, 4 years later now, Brian is just  as determined, just as tireless an advocate for ALS and the ALS  community.   So, again, I think about people like Brian and Dan, my cousin Jenny,  who lost Pat to this awful disease in 2013. He lived with ALS for 8  years. Our family lived with ALS for those 8 years.   And so the advocacy continues because of the passion for so many who  have lived through a life that is almost difficult for us to imagine.   And as they have come out of losing a loved one to a disease like  this, to know that they are willing to carry that flag, that they are  willing to commit their time, their resources, and everything that they  have so that others don't go through this, we honor them. We honor that  commitment.   I am so pleased to be able to work with my partner on this and to  know that this was a good success, but we are going to need to be doing  more, and I will be doing it with him.   I yield to my friend from Delaware.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I think here in the Senate, so many of  us have the privilege to occasionally host military fellows,  congressional military fellows, and I would like to take just a minute  here to recognize the great work of a former member of my staff, Air  Force Lt. Col. Randi Ludington. She spent the last year working in my  personal office as part of the U.S. Air Force congressional fellowship  program. She just concluded that fellowship program just last week and  has moved on to her next assignment, but I think it is important to be  able to publicly express my appreciation for the work she did over the  last year and really for her service to the Nation overall.   For 17 years now, Randi has served in the U.S. Air Force. She was  first an enlisted financial technician before she earned her commission  and worked her way up to the rank of lieutenant colonel. She had a  level of exposure before coming to my office certainly. These  experiences of being in different places around the world, leading  airmen, advising commanders, really proved invaluable when she came to  provide her expertise in my office.   Not only has she spearheaded efforts legislatively and prepped me for  meetings and hearings, she really became a key member of our team,  working with Alaskans, working with counterparts back here, but really  serving them just as she would serve her own troops.   When we were faced with a very chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan,  Randi was one of those who was really burning the midnight oil. She was  putting in long days and long nights, answering calls from constituents  and veterans who were seeking help. She was doing just that. She was  there around the clock, sometimes just listening, offering words of  support; other times just really helping to synchronize the efforts  between people on the ground in Kabul, lining them up with Departments  and Agencies here in Washington, doing everything she could to try to  help facilitate the needs of so many who were so desperate to get out.   In the end, Randi was honored by an Alaska Native Corporation, the  Goldbelt Corporation. They had been engaged in an airlift, a  significant airlift, and she was recognized by Goldbelt for her  dedicated efforts assisting them throughout that whole ordeal. So it  was nice to know that she had received not only the recognition and  thanks from those here, fellows back in Alaska, but also the broader  international recognition.   So I take this moment to just express my thanks to Randi. It was a  pleasure having her in my office. She has a fabulous family. It was a  great pleasure to be able to get to meet her husband Brad, an Air Force  veteran himself. They have three super-great little kids: Charlee,  Ryan, and Graham.   I wish Randi and her family nothing but the best as she moves forward  with her military career.   I feel very fortunate that we get some of our Nation's best, who are  able  [[Page S9282]]  to take kind of a little bit of a detour through their professional  trajectory in the military to come here, work with us, share their  level of expertise, and also educate themselves on the internal process  we have here.   I was very fortunate to have her as part of my team. I think we  should all be proud to know that it is leaders like her who comprise  our military.   So, again, thank you, Randi, for what you have done for our country  and what you have done to help Alaska.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
