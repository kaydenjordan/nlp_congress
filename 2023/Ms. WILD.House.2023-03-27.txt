 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and  I rise in support of H.R. 1154.   This is a measure authored by Representative Chris Smith, who is the  chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Global Health, Global  Human Rights, and International Organizations of which I am the ranking  member. He has been a long-time leader in this body on human rights  challenges, and I am glad to be supporting this measure today. I look  forward to continuing to work with Representative Smith to address many  important global human rights challenges in the coming months on our  subcommittee.   I also thank Representative Keating, the Democratic co-lead of this  measure, for working across the aisle to refine this bill and make it  bipartisan.   According to the State Department's 2022 Country Reports on Human  Rights Practices, there have been troubling reports regarding the PRC  ``forcibly harvesting organs from prisoners of conscience, including  religious and spiritual adherents.''   This is beyond the pale and absolutely unacceptable. It is important,  therefore, that the State Department look more deeply into this issue.   H.R. 1154 shines a light on this horrible practice and calls on the  State Department to make its annual reporting on the issue more robust  and in depth. Not only does it call for more regular assessments of the  problem, it also imposes sanctions on individuals that are involved in  forced organ harvesting and trafficking.   This legislation will make sure that the United States is carefully  gathering all of the facts to make an informed assessment regarding the  magnitude and prevalence of this problem.   We should never look away from injustice and repression wherever it  takes place. In that spirit, I support this legislation, and I urge all  of my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1154 is an important, bipartisan measure. We know  that organ harvesting has been a problem in China. We also know that  PRC officials in Xinjiang have collected biometric data from Uyghur and  other ethnic minority detainees. Given the ongoing genocide in  Xinjiang, we simply cannot take Beijing at its word  [[Page H1449]]  about what it is and is not doing. We need to investigate, and we need  to verify.   H.R. 1154 does just that. It calls on the State Department to provide  important information to Congress, to the American public, as well as  to the world about the scope of organ harvesting and trafficking around  the world so that we may respond appropriately.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and  I rise in support of H.R. 1107.   Mr. Speaker, the People's Republic of China, PRC, is the biggest  emitter of greenhouse gases in the entire world. Yet, for too long, it  has shirked its responsibility to do more to combat climate change on  the world stage. The PRC does this by seeking and securing the status  of a ``developing country'' in international treaties and  organizations, despite being the world's second-largest economy.   This kind of special treatment needs to stop. China needs to pay its  fair share to fight global challenges.   That is why I stand here today to support the bipartisan measure by  my colleagues Representative Young Kim and Representative Gerry  Connolly.   H.R. 1107 calls on the State Department to work diplomatically within  all relevant international organizations and treaties where China is  treated as a developing nation to change its status. It is time that  the PRC should be ascribed the responsibilities commensurate with its  global impact and power.   The bill also ensures that U.S. diplomats will work to create  mechanisms to consider such a change if they do not already exist. Most  importantly, it will authorize our diplomats to work to ensure that the  PRC is not getting special treatment regardless of the status it has.   Right now, China gets to have its cake and eat it, too. It is  bolstering its influence and presence in international organizations  and treaties, all the while avoiding having to contribute its  appropriate share to solving global problems.   The PRC claims it is a responsible global power. This bill aims to  hold it accountable by asking it to accept greater burden-sharing for  global problems. This is an important measure.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1107 is an important bipartisan measure that calls  out the People's Republic of China for failing to do its part in  international organizations and treaties and calls on it to do more.   At the same time, the diplomatic actions that this measure calls for  highlight just how critical it is that the United States remain engaged  and present in international and multilateral forums and treaties.   We can only shape global decisions for the benefit of U.S. interests  and can only counter the PRC if we are in the room. We have to  negotiate and engage in diplomacy to advance our interests. Otherwise,  as we have seen repeatedly, when the United States is absent or silent,  China immediately swoops in to drive the international policy  conversation and agenda in the direction it wants.   I support this bipartisan measure because it deepens both U.S.  engagement  [[Page H1451]]  in international treaties and organizations while trying to effectively  counter the PRC's own self-interested actions in these forums.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me and support this  important bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and  I rise in support of H.R. 1189.   The United States faces a strategic competitor in China that, as  National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has stated, ``is determined to  overtake U.S. technological leadership and willing to devote nearly  limitless resources to that goal.'' This technological competition will  have a tremendous impact on our national security and economic  interests.   Beijing is trying to take the lead in building the world's digital  infrastructure as part of its Belt and Road Initiative. Increasingly,  this push includes a focus on undersea cables, which carry over 95  percent of all international internet traffic, according to a recent  Reuters report.   These cables transmit mundane things like emails and Facebook  postings, but they also transmit more sensitive things such as  financial transactions, as well as proprietary information or  government secrets.   It is in our interest and in the interest of our partners and allies  that these crucial data pathways are not vulnerable to attacks and  espionage, which is harder to do if they are built and operated by PRC  entities.   We got an example of that last month when two communications cables  that connected Taiwan to two of its islands were cut by civilian PRC  vessels, disconnecting 14,000 residents from the internet.   This bipartisan measure by Representative Brian Mast and  Representative   Andy Kim aims to put the United States in a position  to reduce such risks and win the competition over who gets to develop  the physical infrastructure that will drive the digital commerce of the  coming decades.                                time  1745    H.R. 1189 requires the development of a strategy to eliminate the  availability to foreign adversaries of goods and technologies capable  of supporting undersea cables. It also calls on the Bureau of Industry  and Security to apply export controls on the goods identified in the  strategy and work with our partners to ensure those goods and  technologies are not being exported to China.   The United States needs to be proactive in the competition with the  PRC. This important bipartisan measure is an example of how we can  secure American and global interests by using U.S. policy tools in an  effective and timely fashion.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. H.R.  1189 is a timely and forward-thinking bill. The United States is  already engaged in a commercial competition with the PRC to win  contracts to build undersea cables and create the technologies that  power this vital infrastructure. It is important that the United States  Government have a proactive strategy to win this critical area of  competition with the PRC.   Some PRC companies involved in undersea cable development are  actively engaged in helping to modernize the People's Liberation Army  as part of China's civil-military fusion strategy. This raises clear  national security concerns that warrant the use of export controls to  ensure that American goods and technologies are not contributing to  that effort. This bill will result in coordination with our partners  and our allies to ensure that Beijing is not able to compromise our  national security through the development of PRC-sponsored undersea  cables.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me and support this  important bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
