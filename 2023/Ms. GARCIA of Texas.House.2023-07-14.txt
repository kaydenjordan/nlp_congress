 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to sound the alarm  about the extreme heat in Texas that is putting people's lives in  danger.   Workers in agriculture, construction, mail delivery, and landscaping  are in danger and at risk for heat-related injuries or even death every  day.   Many workers in my district are working outside at a heat index that  is well above 100 degrees.   Heat is the number one cause of weather-related deaths in the United  States--more than floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes.   Just last month, Felipe Pascual, a construction worker in the Houston  area, collapsed on the jobsite and later died due to hyperthermia.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I introduced the Construction Injury  Prevention Act to provide paid 15-minute rest breaks for workers every  4 hours.   This bill puts people over profits, it puts people over politics, and  will literally save lives. We need to act to keep our workers safe, and  we must act now.                            ____________________
