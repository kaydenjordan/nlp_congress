 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the  decision by the Corporation for National and Community Service, or  CNCS, to close all State and territorial offices and replace them with  eight regional offices.   If this plan is implemented, just by way of example, the office in my  home State of Rhode Island will close. If this happens, we will lose  the local experts who understand the histories and cultures of the  communities they serve, and with them, the years-long relationships  that they have built up in our communities.   The closures will particularly harm smaller organizations that rely  on CNCS, like New Urban Arts, the Rhode Island Free Clinic, Federal  Hill House, and Riverzedge Arts.   That is why I have joined my colleagues in sending a letter to CEO  Barbara Stewart opposing the plan, and why I am cosponsoring  Representative  [[Page H3297]]  McCollum's Keep Community Service Local Act.   At a time when Americans, particularly our young people, report  feeling evermore disconnected from their government, programs like  national service and civics education are crucial in helping to repair  the fabric of our democracy.   Let's not let this decision stand. Let's see it turned around. Keep  these offices open.                            ____________________
