 Mr. Chairman, first I want to thank the gentleman from  Colorado for the amendment and the committee for the opportunity. The  U.S. Institute of Peace is intended to be a nonpartisan independent  national institute funded by Congress, and I question both the  nonpartisan nature of the Institute and the need, quite honestly, for  the Federal Government to fund it now, at least $1 billion over these  many years at $35 million a year, and, as the gentleman from Colorado  said, in a duplicative effort.   Nobody is against peace and nobody is against love. The question is:  Do we need a State Department doing it at the cost of billions of  dollars and then this other organization doing the exact same work at a  cost of another $35 million annually when we are $20 trillion in debt  and more, maybe up to $200 trillion in unfunded liabilities? And then  to add insult to injury, regarding the nonpartisan independent nature  that the taxpayers are forced to fund, on January 5th of 2016, on an  episode of C-SPAN, Manal Omar, the acting vice president for the Middle  East and Africa Center conducted a highly divisive,  [[Page H7126]]  partisan attack on then-leading Republican primary candidate Donald  Trump and the Republican party as a whole.   Some of her more egregious statements include: ``What Trump is doing  is inciting violence, make no mistake about it. He has blood on his  hands.'' And ``Trump and other Republican rhetoric have validated that  type of violence against Muslims. It has given them an excuse to  actually turn the negative rhetoric into violence.''                                time  1600    Her comments followed the violent attacks in San Bernardino and  Paris.   To my knowledge, no punitive action was taken against Ms. Omar, and  she continues to serve as the associate vice president for the Middle  East and Africa Center at USIP.   I wrote the Institute a letter in that regard inquiring as to her  status, whether there would be punitive measures taken for this obvious  partisan and vicious attack on the Republican Party and the candidate  that was then leading, and, of course, I didn't hear back until, oh, I  don't know, 2 days ago, when we saw that there was an amendment to  defund the U.S. Institute of Peace.   Again, Mr. Chairman, to add insult to injury, this place spends $35  million, including telling the American people what they should think  about their politicians. That is not their mission, that is not what we  are paying for, and that is why we should stop paying for it.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This amendment would prevent funds from being used to expand EPA  authority pursuant to section 115 of the Clean Air Act.   Now, this isn't an amendment to assail the Clean Air Act, but there  is a flaw with it, which is section 115. That section of the Clean Air  Act allows the EPA to mandate State emissions levels to whatever amount  the agency deems appropriate if they find two things. They have to find  that U.S. emissions endanger a foreign nation; and the endangered  nation has a reciprocal agreement to prevent or control emissions in  their own nation.   Now, it was previously argued that the Paris climate agreement met  those requirements. When they wrote the Clean Air Act back in the  1970s, they never foresaw the Paris Agreement. And the Paris Agreement  is not a treaty. It is an agreement.   Fortunately, President Trump's decision to withdraw from the  agreement has alleviated those prior concerns. Whether you agree with  this President or the last one or the future President is immaterial.  The point is that this portion of the law shouldn't exist. That  authority shouldn't exist at the executive level, especially when we  don't do treaties anymore.   Despite the temporary relief, the fact remains that section 115 of  the Clean Air Act is just simply bad policy. Section 115 delegates an  incredible amount of authority to the executive branch without any  safeguards, without any oversight by the legislative branch.   This amendment would block the use of section 115 to delegate this  power over the energy sector, over our States, to the unelected,  unaccountable bureaucrats at the EPA.   In the future, such expansive authority at the EPA could be  economically devastating and could threaten the reliability and  viability of our Nation's energy sector without any checks and  balances.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Yes, ma'am.    If the gentlewoman will continue to yield, what I am  concerned about is not necessarily the Trump administration or the  Obama administration. Any administration with the unbridled power that  section 115 gives the administration, without any checks or balances,  to make an agreement with another nation and then enforce--have their  agency enforce their regulations at whatever they deem appropriate on  every single State in the United States, without any ability of  Congress to intervene whatsoever.   It is not particular to this administration, the last administration,  or any future administration. It is particular to all of them. The  authority, in my opinion, should not exist for them to do that without  any checks and balances from the legislative branch.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Calvert).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
