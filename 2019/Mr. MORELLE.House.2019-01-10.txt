 Madam Speaker, this is a frustrating time in Washington,  in which most of us have been focused on the ongoing government  shutdown. But I want to take a moment to talk about something positive  the House is doing to protect everyday Americans across this country.   My colleagues and I have passed a motion to intervene in the Texas  vs. United States lawsuit. If allowed to stand, this lower court ruling  would pull the rug out from under millions of Americans who rely on the  Affordable Care Act for health coverage, many of whom were denied  coverage in the past for a preexisting condition.   133 million Americans are living with chronic illness, serious  medical conditions, or even minor medical histories that used to  disqualify them from all but the most expensive insurance coverage. We  cannot return to a time when a cancer survivor or a child with diabetes  is rejected for coverage because of a preexisting condition.   Affordable, quality healthcare should be a right for every American,  and we should be making it easier, not harder, for everyone to get the  insurance they deserve. That is why I am proud that the House has taken  the action to intervene in the lawsuit, demonstrating our steadfast  commitment to fighting back against those who seek to dismantle the  fundamental protections no person should be denied.   I will continue to work tirelessly with my colleagues to uphold and  protect access to American healthcare.                            ____________________
