 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding to  me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this proposed right-to-try  legislation. This bill offers patients false hope. It proposes a  pathway to experimental drugs that offers absolutely no guarantee of  access, while stripping patients of any legal or financial recourse,  and places clinical trials at risk.                                time  1800    Last week, I am sure like everyone else, I heard from many  constituents on behalf of their families and communities with  devastating diseases, like multiple sclerosis.   When a family member is faced with a devastating diagnosis, you would  do anything and try anything to improve their quality of life. I know.  I have been there with family members in such heartbreaking situations.  But this bill would not necessarily make it easier to get experimental  treatments and it would definitely make it harder for patients in the  future to get treatments. We need clinical trials to ensure drugs are  safe and effective and to find real cures and treatments for these  patients.   Because this bill would be dangerous for patients both today and in  the future, many disease groups oppose the bill, including the National  Organization for Rare Disorders, the American Cancer Society, the  Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and more.   Rushing this bill without proper bipartisan oversight places the  American people in the way of real harm. Rescinding FDA oversight on  unproven therapies is a perilous proposition.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
