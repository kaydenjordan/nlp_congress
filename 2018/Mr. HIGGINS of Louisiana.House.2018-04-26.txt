 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment is very simple.  If adopted, it would require the administrator of the Federal Aviation  Administration to initiate a 10-year pilot program to permit operators  of State 2 airplanes to conduct operations in medium-hub or non-hub  airports.   This pilot program would additionally require that participating  airports certify each year that they wish to remain in the program. The  whole purpose of my amendment is to allow rural airports that are  located outside of more heavily populated areas to have the ability to  conduct commercial and noncommercial activities that currently are not  allowed.   Mr. Chairman, this is a pro-business and commonsense amendment, and I  urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it and the  passage of Chairman Shuster's underlying bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to  reclaim my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster).    Mr. Chairman, I stand in support of this  amendment, and I respect my colleague's concerns. I have communicated  thoroughly with my constituents in rural areas that would benefit from  this amendment and allow the further use of rural airports without  interfering with neighborhoods. It has broad support, my friend, across  the communities that I represent, and I urge my colleague to reconsider  and to support my amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
