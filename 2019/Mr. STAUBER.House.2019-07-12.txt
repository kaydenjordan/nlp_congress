 Madam Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of Timothy  McDonald and Deb Schott, who both tragically perished in a helicopter  crash at the Brainerd airport last month.   Both Timothy and Deb dedicated their lives to helping others. Timothy  was a medical pilot for North Memorial's Air Care Unit and had  previously served in the United States Army. He did two tours in Iraq.  Deb was an emergency flight nurse for North Memorial's Air Care Unit.  She had worked in the medical field since she was 19 years old.   Timothy and Deb both had outstanding reputations in their respective  fields and were both beloved by their coworkers. My thoughts and  prayers are with their loved ones.   Madam Speaker, our first responders are often the first on the scene,  ready to help in times of crisis. We must never take the work they do  or the sacrifices they make for granted.                            ____________________
