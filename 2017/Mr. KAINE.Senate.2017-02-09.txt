 Mr. President, I also rise to speak about the nomination  of Congressman Price as HHS Secretary. I will oppose his nomination,  principally because he has been an opponent of virtually every program  that provides health care access to people with modest means in this  country: Medicare, Medicaid, the S-CHIP program--which he called  socialism--Planned Parenthood, which is the primary health care  provider of choice for millions of women, and the Affordable Care Act.   There is much to talk about, but I am going to focus my comments  today on his repeated promises to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  Repeal of the Affordable Care Act would be very unwise. It would be  heartless, and it would be economically foolish. The Virginia stats are  instructive. In Virginia, 179,000 Virginians have been able to enroll  in Medicaid since the ACA was passed--an additional 179,000--and nearly  380,000 Virginians have been able to get coverage through the  marketplace.   We have not done the Medicaid expansion program. If we did, another  400,000 could receive care through the ACA. Nearly 4 million Virginians  have protection against discrimination on the grounds of preexisting  health conditions. They have such conditions, and they could be turned  away from insurance companies, as they have been in the past, as my own  family has been.   Before the ACA, only those with employer coverage got tax benefits to  help pay for health insurance. Now, 320,000 moderate- and low-income  Virginians get tax credits averaging $275 a month to help. In addition,  there are nearly 5 million Virginians with employer-sponsored  insurance, and over 800,000 Virginians would lose access to free  preventive care under Medicare if the ACA were to be repealed.   Nationally, a repeal of the ACA--under an estimate of the Urban  Institute--would cause 30 million people to lose their health  insurance. That is the combined population of 19 States.   We had a hearing last week in the Senate HELP Committee about the  Affordable Care Act. It was called, by the majority, ``ObamaCare  Emergency.'' I asked the witnesses, Democratic, Republican, and of no  political identification--I asked them: Would a repeal of the  Affordable Care Act with no replacement be an emergency? All of the  [[Page S998]]  witnesses agreed that it would. One of the witnesses said it is more  than an emergency, it would be a catastrophe.   So then I asked those witnesses--again, bipartisan witnesses: OK. We  shouldn't repeal it. That means we should fix it or repair it or reform  it or improve it. Should we do a fix or improvement hastily,  carelessly, and secretly or should we do it openly, publicly,  carefully, and deliberately?   They all said: Of course, we should not rush. We should get this  right. That is why many colleagues on our side have asked Republicans  to sit down with us and let's make improvements, but don't push people  off of health insurance.   It would also lead to a significant economic catastrophe for  hospitals, for providers, to have a repeal and not know what comes  next. Remember that health care is one-sixth of the American economy.  If you inject uncertainty into that, you have consequences that we  could not now predict that would be negative.   The real story is not any of these statistics, and I will pick up on  what my friend, the Senator from Arkansas, said. The real story is  about individuals, patients, and what happens. Three weeks ago, I put  on my Web site a little section, kaine.senate.gov/acastory. I asked  people to submit what it would mean to have a repeal of the Affordable  Care Act.   To date, I have had 1,654 submissions of what it would mean to them.  We have been able to follow up on some of them and get permission from  some so I could read their stories on the floor. So during the  remainder of my speech, I am just going to tell you what a repeal of  the ACA would mean to people all over my Commonwealth.   Michael Dunkley lives in Alexandria VA.         I was diagnosed with advanced Stage 4 non-Hodgkin's       lymphoma cancer in October of 2013 and was put immediately on       an extremely powerful 5-component chemotherapy treatment       program that would conclude in late January, 2014. My medical       insurance coverage at the time of my diagnosis was under the       terms of COBRA, and my monthly premium was $875, with a       $7,500 deductible and a $15,000 out-of-pocket limit.        My COBRA coverage expired at midnight on December 31, 2013,       and was immediately [able to be] replaced [because of a] plan       that I had been issued through the provisions of the . . .       Affordable Care Act. Because of the new law, I could not be       denied coverage due to a pre-existing condition (advanced       cancer), and I was issued a new plan that was far superior in       coverage and cost me only $575 a month, with zero deductible       and an $1,850 out-of-pocket limit. 3 days after receiving my       new health insurance coverage, I was infused with my 5th-      round of chemotherapy, for which I was charged $35,000.       Near the end of January, 2014, I received a 6th-dose of       chemotherapy and was billed another $35,000. . . . I was       given a PET-CT nuclear scan that cost $5,000, and 1 week       after that, on February 14, 2014, my wife and I were told       by my oncologist that my advanced cancer [was now in]       complete remission. As I am the sole caregiver for my       wife, who has advanced Multiple Sclerosis, the news of the       cancer's remission was a life-saver for her as well as       myself.        Had it not been for the Patient Protection and Affordable       Care Act, I would not have been able to purchase [my] health-      care insurance, for any price, due to my pre-existing       condition of having cancer. Had it not been for the income       subsidy, I would have not been able to afford to pay the       premium for a superior plan, a plan which saved my life.       Thank you, President Obama, and thanks to every member of       Congress that voted in favor of the lifesaving Patient       Protection and Affordable Care Act.    Patricia Mills, Virginia Beach.         My daughter, who has Lupus, and her husband, who has       juvenile diabetes have been struggling for the last six years       to keep their conditions under control. They have a gifted       seventeen year old daughter who has been in the IB academy in       Virginia Beach, and have had to sell their home to pay off       debts due to complications from their illnesses. My husband       and myself have made our home their home, but their struggles       have continued because of the enormity of their medical       expenses.        Since they have been able to enter the Affordable Care Act       for their insurance, they have been able to stabilize their       lives financially. If the Affordable Care Act is repealed, I       don't know what will happen to them. Insulin is extremely       expensive and so are the supplies to inject and check blood       sugar to keep my son in law alive. There is NO option for a       diabetic to turn to to get life saving insulin a diabetic       individual needs who works hard every day, but falls above       the Medicare threshold. We are living in terror at the       thought of a repeal.    Justine Jackson, Radford:         As I type this, I am currently sitting in the office of the       Community Health Center of the New River Valley. I am 25       years old and the last doctor I had seen until today was my       pediatrician. Like many struggling Americans, I cannot afford       insurance and rely on low income/free clinics to receive       preventive care. The ACA helped programs like the one at the       Community Health Center [clinic] with funding.        We cannot afford to lose clinics like this one with cuts to       funding public health. Americans should not be denied health       care. We should not have to file for bankruptcy for becoming       sick or avoiding a doctor all together because it costs too       much. The Affordable Care Act should be revised, not       repealed. If Congress repeals the ACA, 20 million Americans       risk losing insurance. That's 20 million Americans that may       stop going to doctors because they can't afford it. I plead       to Congress to care about your fellow Americans and give us       health coverage that is affordable or, better yet free.       Seeing the doctor should not revolve around a choice between       going hungry or not.    Gabriella Falco, Alexandria, VA:         Senator Kaine, my name is Gabriella, I'm a 26-year old       full-time student studying what she loves. I work part-time       in my field of study and make some money to live on, but my       school expenses are all covered by student loans. When I was       22, fresh out of college and unemployed, I was diagnosed with       hyperparathyroidism and many severe kidney stones. To prevent       kidney failure or worse, I required multiple surgeries, all       of which were covered by my parents' insurance through the       Affordable Care Act. Ever since, I have had twice yearly       check-ups and ultrasounds, as well as some scares with my       kidneys. There is no explanation for my medical history. All       the doctors can do is monitor and treat it when troubles       arise.        When I turned 26, I chose my own healthcare plan through       the ACA. As I am a student, I have no way of working full       time for benefits. The ACA has allowed me to live and safely       and affordably monitor and treat my kidneys while finishing       my master's degree. Were it not for the ACA, I fear my health       would become a choice between death or bankruptcy. I don't       know what I'll do if I lose my health care. I could not       afford it without the ACA. I will fight for you, Senator       Kaine, and please fight for me and my health in Washington.    Corwin Hammond, Williamsburg, VA:         Senator Kaine, Before the ACA, my wife and I did not have       nor could we afford medical insurance. My wife is a business       owner and I'm a pastor of a small church in Toano, Virginia.       I left my . . . state job that provided full benefits,       because the ministry needs in my community were so great. I       am grateful for this legislation that has allowed us to have       peace of mind in knowing that we are covered and able to       visit the doctor without going bankrupt. Why not just fix the       components that need repairing; instead of throwing millions       of hard-working Americans to the wolves. We deserve       better. How about the congress and senate repealing their       health care and leaving ours alone? Thank You, Corwin       Hammond.    Sarah Mullins-Spears, Prospect, VA:         Senator Kaine, I have one perfectly imperfect child. He has       not one but two ``pre-existing'' conditions. . . . He was       diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome . . . and he was also born       with a unicameral bone cyst, a hollow bone. . . .    That affects one in four children.         This year we were able to purchase our lifelong dream. . .       . A family farm. . . . 18 PERFECT acres of peace and promise.       This summer we endured a medical ordeal we could have NEVER       imagined. . . . My son broke his arm, due to the cyst, for       the 4th time in less than 3 years. . . . And we were finally       approved for surgery to place a titanium rod through the cyst       that would prevent any further breaks. On July 26th the       surgery was successfully completed and the next day we were       released with instructions on pain management and to not       remove the surgical bandages for 3 days. On July 30th we       removed the bandages to find a hot, swollen, bright red       nightmare. We were readmitted to the hospital. . . . I wasn't       truly afraid until I saw the face of the same nurse that       discharged us that night. . . . she was fighting back tears.       . . . Over the next 3 days there were 2 additional surgeries       including a PICC line, and after 6 days we were released to       home health care. . . . Suddenly I was a health care       provider, every 8 hours a dose of antibiotics had to be       attached to the PICC line, it took approximately 90 minutes       to administer, and then the line had to be cleaned and       prepped. There was NEVER a 6 hour window that I could be away       from my child. . . . Which meant I was not able to work the 6       hour schedule at my part time job. Which means after the       second week I was let go, told I could reapply when I was       ready to come back to work. . . . On August 26th my son slept       for almost 20 straight hours and then woke up vomiting and       with a fever. . . . So by lunch we were readmitted to the       hospital again. . . . The next day while in the hospital he       broke out in a mystery rash from head to toe, and had a white       blood cell count of a chemo patient. For me this was the       worst, because no one, not even the consult from UVA       infectious diseases, knew why. After 3 days, with the WBC       count trending up and more research, the leap of faith was       decided to end all antibiotics and see if they were the cause       for the reactions. They were and by October my child was       declared healed and eligible to start school. . . . Almost 5  [[Page S999]]       weeks after he should have started his first day of middle       school. . . . By then the bills had also begun to arrive . .       . Daily. The first bill from the hospital was $105,547.12       before insurance and over $12,000 with benefits. We are still       receiving bills and our pre insurance totals are well over       $750,000 before insurance. . . . BUT because of ACA we were       capped at $7,500 out of pocket. This means $231 a month for       24 months which has an impact on our family but it also means       we can still afford our mortgage. I wake up every morning       thankful for my healthy child and amazed that we live on this       tiny piece of heaven. ACA made that possible for us. I have       kept all bills, x rays, and documents related to our journey.    Sasha Baskin, Richmond:         When I was seventeen I discovered I had a rare and highly       aggressive tumor in my jaw. It took three experimental       surgeries to remove and replace the tumor with a metal       implant and bone graft. I was fortunate enough to be       dependent on my parents' insurance when this medical event       first took place. With the Affordable Care Act I have been       able to stay on my parents' insurance into college and       graduate school and maintain my health status through regular       doctors' visits. I require a yearly check-up to make sure       that the medical implant is intact and that the bone graft is       growing successfully. Within the next 5-10 years I will need       another surgery to replace the metal implant with new       technology. If the implant breaks or I have any kind of       accident that injures my jaw I will require emergency surgery       and most likely to have my jaw wired shut. I will turn 26 in       October and no longer be eligible to be on my parents'       insurance. Thanks to the affordable care act I can rely on       being able to maintain affordable insurance and feel       comfortable about my health. I can trust that I will not be       turned away due to my pre-existing condition of a metal jaw       and history of aggressive tumors. I can be sure that I will       not reach a lifetime limit of coverage when I need another       surgery, (or if the worst happens and I need to have       emergency surgery). When the doctors first found this tumor       when I was seventeen, they told me not to go to college       because I needed so many surgeries. I was planning to attend       art school in Maryland, my parents lived in Connecticut and       my doctors were in Boston. I was determined not to let a       medical problem control my life. I went to and graduated from       college in Maryland and am now enrolled in graduate school       pursuing masters of fine arts in Richmond Virginia. I rely on       the affordable care act for safe and reliable access to       doctors all over the country. I have been able to live my       life independently because of the freedoms and access to       healthcare it has provided. I am a recent Virginia citizen,       but I love it here. I am proud of my representation and I       hope that my story will help you work towards saving health       care in our country.    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will suspend.    I will suspend and return following the swearing in.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to resume my remarks following  the swearing in.   I also offer my congratulations to my new colleague.   Ann Odenhal, Richmond, VA:         On New Year's Eve, 2013, we were informed that our youngest       son, Patrick, 18 years old, had Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), an       incurable disease that comes with a lifetime of insulin       dependence, injecting oneself six to eight times a day. The       cause is unknown, it is not a lifestyle disease and there is       no escaping it once diagnosed. The beta cells on our son's       pancreas just stopped working. T1D is extremely dangerous and       when not managed can cause blindness, kidney failure, limb       loss, other issues and death. We were knocked off our feet,       numb, confused and overwhelmed by the danger and the medical       requirements to stay within an acceptable insulin range.       People with the disease must balance insulin doses with       eating and other activities throughout the day and night.       They must also measure their blood-glucose level by pricking       their fingers for blood six or more times a day. Our son       still can have dangerous high or low blood-glucose levels,       both of which can be life threatening. He will die without       insulin; he could die from too much insulin. In the midst of       our fog of sadness and confusion, we remembered the ACA. ``At       least the ACA will be there when Patrick is on his own. He       will be able to get health insurance regardless of his prior       condition,'' was our mantra. One day, Patrick came home and       announced, ``Great news! The ACA allows me to stay on your       health insurance until I'm 26!''    I changed my retirement schedule. I can do that. I have watched and  worried as insulin prices soar. Pat takes two types of insulin, a  single carton of which costs between $400 and $500 retail. I run the  math in my head and I worry some more about lack of insurance. We are  covered by my employer's insurance, which pays for most of the drugs,  equipment and the additional health care he needs, but what would  happen if we found ourselves without insurance? What if I lose my job?  Public service runs deep in our family. My husband is a retired teacher  and our older son is a policeman. It appears Pat may be moving toward  nonprofit or public service work as well. Will he have health  insurance? Will he have it without the ACA? I can promise anyone  reading this that you know someone whose life has been or will be  positively impacted by the ACA. There are 20 million people like our  son, Patrick. Don't allow a repeal of the ACA. Fix the problems, work  the issues, but don't play politics with our son's life.   Linda Crist, Lynchburg, VA:         I had employer provided health care for 38 years. In 2013 I       lost my eyesight to macular degeneration and could no longer       work. An insurance company covered me for $695 a month (just       me). With the lost income, I could no longer afford       insurance. I contacted them and was told there was a new plan       I could apply for. I applied and was denied due to a ``pre-      existing condition.'' You see, in 1984--    Decades before--         I was diagnosed with kidney disease. I was treated and,       according to my physician, cured. The insurance company       didn't care. I applied for insurance under ACA and got a       silver plan that cost me $345 a month. I was given a tax       credit of $500 monthly and I chose to only use a portion of       it. The ACA saved me while I was waiting for Medicare to kick       in after receiving Disability. I am sure my premium would       have gone up with the ACA but it saved me when I needed it.''    John Carl Setzer, Winchester, VA:         My son was born in 2009 with a severe congenital heart       defect, called Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS).       Basically, he was born with half a heart and required three       open-heart surgeries. All of his treatment is considered       palliative. In 2009, he had the first two heart surgeries, in       addition to another on his diaphragm. He was hospitalized for       many weeks. He had insurance under my employer-based       coverage. Clearly he had a pre-  [[Page S1000]]       existing condition. But the other issue is that he almost       maxed out his insurance coverage in the first year of life.       My understanding is that the ACA eliminated the lifetime caps       on insurance coverage, and my wife and I blew a major sigh of       relief. Otherwise, we would have had to switch his coverage       from my insurance to hers. However, he required another       surgery a couple years later and will at some point likely       require a heart transplant. Thus, the insurance games would       have continued. The ACA eliminated that burden on us, at       least until he is an adult. The lifetime cap is not something       I hear debated much these days, but it is something to       consider for people that have major health complications.       Please consider this in future legislation, in addition to       coverage for pre-existing conditions.    I will read one more story and then cede to my colleague. I have so  many more that I want to read, and this is just 1 or 2 percent of the  1,654 stories that my office has received in 3 weeks.   Jennifer Smouse, Midlothian:         In 2008, my husband started his own construction company       after the national home building company he worked for pulled       out of Richmond. It was our first time being self-employed       and along with adjusting to the idea of not receiving a       paychecks on the 15th and 30th of each month, we needed to       secure our own healthcare coverage for our family of 5. We       submitted our applications for insurance, and were notified a       short time later that we would not be offered coverage for       our oldest child. He is on the autism spectrum and they were       denying him coverage based on his Autism diagnosis. We were       shocked--our son was high functioning and was not in need of       any special medical services. . . .    And he still received this denial.         With the passage of the ACA, we no longer had to worry       about being denied coverage due to a medical diagnosis. The       system is not without its flaws. Our premiums were extremely       high in addition to the high deductible, and it was a stretch       to afford the plans even with the credits available to us.       But at least we felt on even ground. That in addition to       parenting a child on the autism spectrum, we didn't also have       the challenge of securing healthcare coverage for him.    I have other stories. I may resume my seat, but I will now cede time  to my colleague from Florida, Senator Nelson.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.    Mr. President, I thank the Chair for allowing me to retake  the floor to speak about the nomination of Congressman Price to be HHS  Secretary, and to read stories from Virginians who are afraid about  repeal of the Affordable Care Act.   Mark Priest, Alexandria, VA:         I am a self-employed entrepreneur and consultant. Since I       work for myself I do not have access to a special pool from       an employer that would make health insurance more affordable.       Starting in 2014 I was insured through the ACA and I was able       to find an affordable policy to cover myself. I think that       there is a mistaken notion that if you are employed, you       automatically have access to affordable health insurance. The       ACA isn't just for the unemployed. I work hard and I am a       small business owner. The ACA makes it possible for me to       afford health care.    Constance Burch, Fort Valley, VA:         I am a 53 year old single female who is self employed as a       Voice and Piano teacher. I have always prided myself on being       able to care for myself and provide the basic necessities.       Before the ACA I had to pay over $450 a month for health care       on a net income of $19,000. This meant some months having to       use credit cards for other necessities such as food and       gasoline to get to my lessons. Thanks to President Obama,       that all changed and based on my income, my fee was reduced       to $33 a month. I literally cried for joy that someone       finally did something to help those of us who work hard and       deserve the same quality health care that the more fortunate       are able to have. It is fair and quite honestly it was the       first time in my life that I truly felt that the government       actually did something to help me personally and those in the       same position.    Deb Fuller, Alexandria, VA:         I rely on the ACA for my health insurance because       otherwise, I would not be able to get it. My job, writing K12       textbooks and other educational material, has largely been       outsourced, and full-time permanent positions with benefits       are nearly nonexistent these days. The majority of the work       is as a ``flexible workforce'', which is the fancy term for a       freelancer or contract employee. Having the ACA means I can       continue working these contracts instead of trying to figure       out how to completely change professions because I need a job       that provides health insurance. Before the ACA, my saint of a       doctor went back and forth with health insurance companies       trying to convince them that I wouldn't cost them too much       money in the long run. They literally looked for anything to       deny me coverage. One rejection letter mentioned cold sores       in the litany of reasons why I was completely uninsurable.       Ninety percent of the population has cold sores. Now,       insurance companies make back their money on me because I pay       them vastly more than they cover because I don't get sick       that often or visit the doctor that often outside of routine       checkups. I also have peace of mind that if I am out on       horseback riding or hiking on a trail, I won't be put in the       poor house because I landed in a heap and had to go to the       ER.    Lauren Carter, Lovingston, VA:         My 39 year old son has cerebral palsy and a blood clotting       disorder. His ``preexisting conditions'' started at       conception. Three years ago, he lost his full-time job with       health insurance benefits. The ACA allows him to continue       receiving medical care and purchase his lifesaving       medications. He supports himself through multiple part-time       jobs, but employer-based insurance is just not an option for       him at this time.    Shannon Linford, Leesburg:         My name is Shannon Linford, I'm 24, and from the age of 10,       my life has been a series of doctors office visits. I suffer       from over a half dozen chronic illnesses, physical and       mental, and require frequent checkups and take up to 15       prescriptions a day. I have spent the last 14 years balancing       illness with my attempts to build a life. That would not have       been possible were it not for the provisions of the ACA that       prevent insurance companies from denying me service for my       illnesses or allowing me to stay on my parents' insurance       until I am 26. I've had to take a detour from pursuing higher       education due to these illnesses, as well as getting a job,       and instead spend the days I'm well enough volunteering with       nonprofits that advocate for others with illnesses like mine.       My team of doctors and I work together personally to create a       plan that is best for me. We are exemplifying health care at       its best. They know me by name, they know each other by       name--across disciplines, they work and collaborate together.       I would not have this luxury were it not for the ACA. If       insurance companies could deny me coverage due to my       preexisting conditions I was born with, my family and I would       go into bankruptcy trying to give me basic care. My health is       finally under good management. I'm going into remission with       my depression thanks to new experimental treatment with my       psychiatrist. Things are looking up, thanks to the provisions       in this remarkable legislation. Revoking this law would be       criminal and would destroy lives, destroy futures. Thank you       so much for your hard work.    Anna M., Vienna, asked that I not use her last name:         Without the ACA, I would likely be dead. I live with       bipolar disorder, an incurable mental illness that causes my       moods to swing uncontrollably from intense anxiety to       crushing depression. I began seeking help five years ago and       once spent two weeks in an intensive outpatient hospital       program because I was suicidal. I got help, but later lost my       job and my insurance, making my disorder a preexisting       condition. Thankfully, the ACA prevents my new insurance from       refusing coverage, and I was able to continue treatment. I       will need to control my bipolar disorder with medications and       therapy for the rest of my life. Without treatment, I am at a       higher risk for long-term unemployment, becoming homeless,       incarceration, and dying by suicide. With treatment, I work       full-time, pay my taxes, volunteer for local charities, and I       am a loving daughter, sister, and friend.    Katie Rugg in Henrico:         I was paying half of the cost of my rent and health       insurance every month and still having to pay for services       every time I went to be seen. I never knew how much things       would cost when I needed to be seen, either! So I was paying       an outrageous amount for health insurance and also afraid to       go see a doctor if I had any issues because it was going to       cost me more money than I had on top of everything else. I       was already living paycheck to paycheck, with a full-time       professional job in my field and a masters degree, and       seriously considering going without any insurance at all.       When the ACA was passed, my employer offered a discounted       option through the affordable care exchanges. I  [[Page S1002]]       decided it was worth trying. It cut my monthly costs by more       than half and it pays for services at 100 percent of the       Medicare fee schedule. The cost is deducted directly from my       paycheck, and every provider that I have seen has been happy       with the prompt and predictable payment, even if it requires       some explanation at first. The way it works is that I would       pay the difference if there was any between the cost of       service and the Medicare fee payment. So far, any additional       cost to me, besides occasional lab work, which has been very       minimal. And my regular chiropractic care has been completely       covered. It has been phenomenal, like the difference between       day and night for me. Not only did this option allow me to       feel comfortable going in to see a doctor when I had an issue       instead of when I had to and was already sick, it also helped       me put some money away into a modest savings. Most       importantly, with housing costs continuing to rise and my       paycheck staying absolutely static for 3\1/2\ years, I was       finally able to buy my own house through a first-time       homeowners Assistance loan. It took a year of looking and       saving aggressively, but I have done it. I have done it!       Losing my ACA insurance would be devastating. I have come too       close to homelessness with the financial pressures I face in       this economy. I don't want to lose now what I have worked so       hard to gain. Thank you, Sen. Kaine, for what you are able to       do to help people like me.    JoAnne Loiselet, Clifton:   Clifton, VA.         My story is I'm sure like many other women. I was a stay-      at-home mom and in 2009 my husband, who owned his own       business, and I separated and ended up divorced 3 years       later. He is not required to keep my children insured and he       cancelled their health insurance without me knowing it. The       company I started working for doesn't offer health insurance,       and we went without, until the ACA went into effect. Our       pediatrician didn't charge me for office visits and only for       vaccines. When needed, we borrowed money to help pay the       bills. If the ACA gets repealed, what would we do? What would       happen if my son breaks his arm or my daughter breaks her       leg? How could I pay for that? I make $50,000 and live in       Fairfax County and I could end up in bankruptcy. We have a       right to have insurance and live with peace of mind.    Laura Kreynus, Mechanicsville:         My daughter was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease in April of       2013. That September, my husband was diagnosed with       Parkinson's Disease. We are farmers, we raise food for       America. As such, we are independently insured. Prior to       finding a plan through the ACA in January of 2015, our       monthly insurance premiums were increased to nearly $3,000 a       month--yes, a month. On top of that, our health care       insurance had an annual cap on prescription coverage of       $5,000. The Humira that my daughter takes to combat Crohn's       retails for $3,800 a month, and that is not the only       medication she needs. So basically, after one month, we reach       the prescription coverage cap, meaning we would have to pay       $3,800 a month for her medication on top of $3,000 a month in       premiums. Who has an extra $6,800 a month to pay for this?       This is way more than we earn every month. With the health       insurance plan we got through the ACA, our premiums for 2015       were $1,500 a month, less than half of what we would have       been paying. But the real saving grace was no prescription       cap, so my daughter's medications are covered with a copay       after we reach the deductible. This is still a lot of money,       but at least we can treat our daughter's disease and       hopefully keep her healthy. And even though our premiums have       gone up $2,000 a month under the ACA, at least we still have       insurance. Under the Republican Senate's repeal of the       preexisting condition provision, we will not be able to get,       much less afford, any insurance in the future. This will have       devastating consequences to my daughter's health. She is only       15 years old. She deserves a chance in life. I have not even       touched on how no our insurance will affect my husband's       Parkinson's Disease. We are upper middle class income       Americans. I am not asking for a handout. We are paying more       that 25 percent of our income for health care related       expenses. And I can't imagine the affect this has on people       with less resources than we have. Do you know what happens if       you get sick or a disease and you don't have or can't have       health insurance or medical treatment? You die. Seriously,       health care costs are out of control in America and health       care is a basic right, and people are dying.    Cynthia Elliott, Hillsboro:         Gov. Kaine, Without the ACA, I and many other younger       seniors whose jobs do not provide health care would simply be       without until Medicare kicks in. I was paying $1,000 a month       for HMO care. Until I couldn't. But with the ACA, I was able       to get coverage for a reasonable $300 a month. And this one       includes dental care! It is simply a lifesaver for me.    Mary Lloyd Parks, Richmond:         We have excellent insurance coverage (though expensive)       through my husband's partnership in a large law firm, and       we've been grateful. We have two daughters, now 21 and 23.       Our oldest has cystic fibrosis. The Affordable Care Act has       allowed her to stay on her health insurance policy through       college, and now in her first year as an Urban Teachers       fellow in Washington, DC where she is teaching first grade       and studying at night to get her master's degree in       elementary and special education. While her health is       currently good, the medicines she requires to maintain her       health are extremely expensive and without our insurance, she       would not be able to afford them. The prescriptions cost       thousands of dollars every month. We are quite fearful that       when she turns 26, her preexisting condition--a very       expensive and lifelong disease that requires routine       hospitalizations and even lung transplants--would make her       virtually uninsurable. We are counting on the ACA to be in       place when she can no longer be insured as a member of our       family. She has chosen a profession that may not allow her to       afford the care she needs, and she was born with a chronic       serious illness that would be a pre-existing condition that a       future insurer could use to deny her coverage or to charge       her prohibitively high premiums.    Just four more.   Carry Hawes from Midlothian:         Sometimes people forget how much is encompassed in the ACA.       If not for the ACA, my husband would be dead. Diagnosed with       a fatal liver disease in 2007, he needed a liver transplant       and he ended up getting two. On July 19, 2012, he received a       new liver at UNC hospital. He regained his life and we were       able to move home to Richmond to take new jobs and begin a       family, knowing that his preexisting condition would be       covered under the ACA. We were able to live without fear that       an employer would deny us coverage because he was high risk.    Sammye Newman, Richmond:         Before the ACA became law, I was paying more than $1,200 a       month for health insurance. Quitting altogether was one       alternative, but it would have meant paying possibly double       for health care, procedures and lab tests because I would no       longer be eligible for the negotiated prices contracted by       the health insurance company. Still, I was almost out of       money. Then the ACA was passed. My rates fell to between       $50 and $60 per month for better policies than I had       before making the switch. At 62 years of age, I am faced       with health care needs that continue to increase. As a       cancer survivor (21 years and counting!), it is imperative       that I be proactive regarding health care. In fact, having       a good doctor under an affordable employer-sponsored       health care plan is what saved my life 21 years ago.       Please, don't allow this lifeline to be abolished!    Heidi S., of Richmond, asked me not to use her last name:         Thanks to the passage of the ACA, I was able to stay on my       parents' health insurance plan until I turned 26 years old.       This policy change allowed me to go back to school at 24       years old to pursue a Masters degree, during which time I was       diagnosed with a malignant melanoma. The mole was not of       concern to me at all and was found during a routine check-up.       If I did not have access to my parents' health insurance       during that time, I surely would not have had access to the       pathologists and surgeons who diagnosed and removed the       cancer before it had the chance to spread. While no one knows       what would have happened if this tumor not been removed, I       truly feel that I owe my life to the ACA.    Finally, Christopher Woodroof from Bedford, VA:         Dear Senator Kaine, In September of 2011 I began receiving       Social Security Disability Benefits, not from an injury, but       from an illness I was diagnosed with 12 years ago, a rare       blood disorder caused by a mutated gene in my bone marrow. I       worked as many years as I could, but eventually I became       unable to. The company I worked for insurance plan had a       $10,000 deductible, so for me having to go to the hospital       twice a month for most of the twelve years, it has taken all       of my savings and retirement I had accumulated to cover my       medical bills. Seven years ago we had to cancel my wife's       health insurance due to the high cost. Due to the high cost       of medical care, my wife would not see her doctor at times       she really needed to. The amount of disability I receive       barely covers our basic needs, so she felt we could not       afford a doctor bill. Under the Affordable Care Act, she       qualifies for a decent policy that cost us $30 a month. This       has enabled her to start seeing her doctors again and made       her prescriptions for asthma affordable and obtainable again.       This coverage is a lifesaver for us and I'm not sure how [we]       could handle losing it. Please convince your colleagues in       the Senate to show some compassion for those who worked hard       all their life, only to lose everything because they became       ill. Thank you for your service and all you have done for       Virginia and the American people. God bless you. With kindest       personal regard, Chris Woodroof.    This is not a game. This is not politics. This is not a debate. These  are the lives of dozens of Virginians sampled out of 1,600 stories that  have been sent to me in the last 3 weeks, all saying to this body one  thing: Do not repeal the Affordable Care Act. Do not jeopardize the  health care of 30 million people. Do not jeopardize the peace of minds  of parents going to bed at night and making them wonder what will  happen if their child gets sick tomorrow or if they lose their job.  [[Page S1003]]    We can improve, and many of these letters point out things we need to  do to improve the Affordable Care Act. But we shouldn't even be  contemplating a repeal of a law that provides so much good to so many.  This is one of the main reasons, when we vote later today, I am going  to be opposing someone who wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act-- Congressman Tom Price, as he has been nominated for HHS Secretary.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.
