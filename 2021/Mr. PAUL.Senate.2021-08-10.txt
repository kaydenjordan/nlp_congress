 Mr. President, I call up my amendment 3150 and ask that it  be reported by number.    Isn't it ironic that during today's long debate, we have  not heard a word of the actual subject at hand: the budget?   The budget presented by the Democrats has been entirely ignored by  both parties. But if you read it, the Democrat budget before us is a  blueprint for bankruptcy. The Democrat budget never balances and spends  and borrows $15 trillion over 10 years. Already, our national debt  exceeds $28 trillion. We borrow $2 million a minute.   Now, Republicans have largely been united in believing in a  constitutional amendment to balance our amendment in 5 years. In fact,  many of the Members have voted for that.   What I have presented today is an alternative to the Democrat budget.  This is a budget that balances in 5 years, and I recommend a ``yes''  vote.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize a  family-owned small business and beloved staple, Baxter's Coffee of  Somerset, KY, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   In 2001, Terri Tuttle opened Baxter's Coffee in Somerset, KY. After  running a successful ice cream store, Terri decided to pursue a  different business venture. She noticed an opportunity to fill a gap in  the Somerset market since there were no coffee shops in town. As Terri  brainstormed business names, she was inspired by her family's dog,  Baxter. When Baxter's Coffee first opened in 2001, it was an instant  hit. Along with delicious coffee, Terri and her team provided family- friendly service and a welcoming atmosphere. To meet growing demand,  the original Baxter's Coffee shop soon moved to a new location on Ogden  Street and opened a second location in 2005.   In 2021, Baxter's Coffee continues serving some of the best coffee in  Pulaski County. As the business grew, so did the Tuttle family's  involvement. Today, Terri's children, Jay, Lauren, and Ann, are  actively involved in every facet of the business, from coffee roasting,  to marketing, and bookkeeping. They continue welcoming customers from  all over Kentucky and have expanded to four locations in Somerset,  including a kiosk at Lake Cumberland Regional Hospital. Notably, since  2009, Baxter's Coffee has roasted its own coffee. Their newest  location, which opened in 2016, includes a drive-thru, as well as a  roasting and warehouse facility. Baxter's Coffee proudly offers its  signature blends at all four locations and also sells its coffee  wholesale and online. Baxter's Coffee also features baked goods and  treats from local small businesses.   Like many small business owners, Terri is actively involved in her  community. Baxter's Coffee is a member of the Somerset Pulaski Chamber  of Commerce and regularly partners with them to hire local community  members. For years, Baxter's Coffee has contributed to a wide range of  local philanthropic organizations, including God's Food Pantry, and  supported events such as charity golf tournaments, walks, and runs.  They regularly support local school district events and organizations,  including PTA fundraisers. To demonstrate appreciation for first  responders, Baxter's Coffee provides free coffee to all on-duty police  officers.   Baxter's Coffee is a remarkable example of the critical role small  businesses play in uplifting and building community. Family-owned small  businesses like Baxter's Coffee form the heart of towns across  Kentucky, regularly stepping up to support their communities.  Congratulations to Terri and the entire team at Baxter's Coffee. I wish  them the best of luck and look forward to watching their continued  growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
