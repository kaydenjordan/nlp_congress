 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from Texas' comment that the MORE Act  would make us safer calls for a specific response.   As Representative Jordan just said, the fact that the MORE Act is on  the floor at this time epitomizes Democrats' misplaced priorities. But  it also puts on display their inclination to reckless disregard of  consequences.   Just like the clarion call to defund the police, followed rapidly by  astonished surprise over the ensuing surge in violence, Democrats' rush  to legalize marijuana without any heed or response to the rising  epidemic of drug driving across the country would mean more dead and  injured Americans on our highways.   Consider this: since 2013, in Washington State, the number of fatal  crash drivers who tested positive for THC has more than doubled. In  Vermont, since 2010, fatal crashes linked to marijuana use have  skyrocketed by 173 percent following that State's decriminalization.  Forty-seven percent of Oregonians who died in a car crash in 2018  tested positive for marijuana, according to the Oregon State Police.  More Indiana drivers in deadly car crashes test positive for drugs than  for alcohol.   The data is clear: when governments liberalize marijuana laws,  motorists and passengers die.                                time  0945    Law enforcement tells us they lack a reliable roadside test to detect  marijuana use or a uniform standard to measure marijuana toxicity, yet  our defund-the-police Democrat colleagues rush to change the status quo  across the entire country while refusing even to consider my  commonsense amendment that would require the Department of  Transportation to develop and prescribe best practices for testing  drivers suspected of marijuana impairment.   My amendment would help law enforcement keep people safe, but  Democrats would rather prioritize criminals. A North Carolina sheriff  recently called drug driving ``one of the leading killers in our  State.'' Just like Democrats' efforts to defund police, the MORE Act's  unintended consequences will include increased danger for our families.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support Americans' safety by  voting against this bill.
