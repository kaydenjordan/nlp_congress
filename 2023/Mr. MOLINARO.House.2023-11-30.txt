 Dear God, Mr. Speaker, my future former colleague is  divorced from reality. He has manufactured his entire life to defraud  the voters of his district of an honest choice for a Member of  Congress.   He has lied to donors and to colleagues, taking advantage of election  law, using campaign funds to personally benefit himself, and he has  defamed not only his office but the institution itself.   I was not elected, nor any of us, to defend a precedent. I was  elected to defend the United States Constitution. My colleague, in the  most truthful thing he said today, said, we don't want to be compared  to him. My colleague is damn right. I do not want to be compared to  him.   The voters that sent me here expect an independent voice, expect us  to use the rules of the House, and expect us to stand up for the very  decency and laws of this country in protecting the Constitution.   He has lost the right to serve in this House, and I will vote to  expel him.
