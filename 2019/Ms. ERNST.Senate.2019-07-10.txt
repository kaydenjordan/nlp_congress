 Mr. President, I recently received a letter from a  gentleman living in Cedar Falls, IA, who suffers from Parkinson's  disease. As I speak, he is going without his $1,450-per-month LYRICA  prescription in order to keep a roof over his head. That is right,  folks. He must choose between making a mortgage payment and getting his  prescription.   Here is another story a woman from Davenport, IA, shared with me.  Last October, she was able to get a 3-month supply of blood pressure  medication for $17, but when she went to the pharmacy for her refill in  late December, she was told the price had nearly tripled to $55. She  wrote to me and said:         Thinking this was a mistake, I refused the refill and       checked online about the change in price and found I couldn't       get it cheaper anywhere else. So I went back in ten days and       thought I would just have to pay the new cost [which was       $55]. In that time . . . the prescription had gone up to       $130!    Whether I am talking to folks back home in my townhalls and other  events on my 99 County Tour or in meetings right here in Washington,  DC, the cost of prescription drugs is the No. 1 issue I hear about from  Iowans. Every day, I hear stories just like these about the outrageous  costs associated with their prescription medications.   For too long, hard-working Iowans have borne the brunt of  skyrocketing prescription drug prices. Stories like the man from Cedar  Falls and the woman from Davenport have become the norm. We have to  change that, and that is exactly what we are doing here in the Senate.   We have been hard at work in advancing bills to drive down drug  prices, increase competition, and close costly loopholes that are being  exploited by those bad actors. I am proud to lead on three such bills  that were recently approved in committee.   First, I have teamed up with Senator Cotton on a bill that aims to  eliminate an egregious loophole in the patenting process. This loophole  allows drug companies to take advantage of the well-intentioned concept  of sovereign immunity for Native American Tribes in order to dismiss  patent challenges and unfairly stifle competition.   Our legislation would put an end to this manipulative practice and  actually provide Iowans with access to cheaper options for their  prescription drugs. That is not all we are doing in the Senate to make  more low-cost generic drugs available to folks in Iowa. We have also  been working across the aisle on a bipartisan bill that would put a  powerful check on drug companies seeking to keep generics off the  market.   The bill would empower the makers of generic drugs to file lawsuits  against brand-name manufacturers if they fail to provide required  resources, such as drug samples, needed for generics to clear the  regulatory process. In turn, we would see cheaper alternatives  available for my folks in Iowa.   I am also working with my fellow Iowan, Senator Grassley, on a bill  that focuses on the middlemen behind some of the prescription drug  price hikes we have seen recently. The bill would direct the Federal  Trade Commission to examine anti-competitive behavior in the  prescription drug market. As mergers push drug prices higher and  higher, this bill will be instrumental in helping Congress develop  policies to increase competition and lower those costs for both  patients and our taxpayers.   Make no mistake. The rising cost of prescription drugs is an issue  that significantly impacts hard-working Iowans. We in Congress have a  responsibility to take action, to give folks a voice, and to make sure  no family is ever forced to choose between making a mortgage payment  and purchasing their medications.   That is what we are doing. We have some great bills in the Senate-- bills from both Republicans and Democrats--that can help lower those  drug prices, increase competition, and close loopholes. Let's build on  this effort and continue working together in a bipartisan way to get  these bills and others across the finish line and signed into law.  Iowans are counting on us.   I yield the floor.
