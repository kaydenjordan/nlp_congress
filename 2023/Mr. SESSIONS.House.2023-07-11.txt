 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for the time, and  I appreciate the gentleman from California standing in support of this  bill, H.R. 2622.   In fact, this was a bipartisan agreement that we came to. The  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer), and I worked on this, and  he included some language he felt was very important.   The bottom line is that the SEC will be required to extend MiFID II  relief and study its effects as part of long overdue and larger review  of the regulatory framework for investment research.   I believe this agreement that we passed in the House Financial  Services Committee on May 24 by a vote of 45-2 represents not just the  thinking and thought process, but it really meets the needs of the  investor community. For that reason, we believe that we are on the  floor today.   I thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. McHenry, for not only  bringing this but also for his leadership in a series of bills that we  will have on the floor today. Mr. McHenry has served well, and I  appreciate his service.
