 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise to  support H.R. 5314, the Veterans in Effective Apprenticeships Act, with  my colleague, Congresswoman Katherine Clark.   Our Nation's veterans deserve our support while they are deployed and  when they return home, and one of the best ways to do that is to  prepare them for the workforce outside of the military.   Our servicemembers have attained incredible skills during their  service. Sadly, when they return to civilian life, finding a good- paying, family-sustaining job may be difficult.   H.R. 5314 helps streamline the process of attaining apprenticeships  and reduces roadblocks for our veterans. The bill does four major  things:   H.R. 5314 ensures programs are equipped to complete the expedited VA  process for registered apprenticeships.   It clarifies that veterans are eligible for advanced placement and  commensurate wage increases;   The bill instructs apprenticeship programs to account for a  participant's competencies and prior experiences, including those  gained during military service; and   H.R. 5314 aims to improve coordination between the Department of  Labor and the Department of Veterans Affairs.   I am proud to support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.                            ____________________
