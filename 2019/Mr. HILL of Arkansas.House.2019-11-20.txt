 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New  Jersey, my good friend, for yielding, and I have to thank him for his  decades of service and leadership here for free expression and for  liberty in Hong Kong.   I was moved by the Speaker's tribute and appreciate her 30 years of  work there. I thank Mr. Engel for his leadership, and, of course, my  good friend from California, who now is controlling the time for the  majority.                                time  1600    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Hong Kong Human  Rights and Democracy Act and stand in solidarity with the people of  Hong Kong.   For 6 months, we have witnessed Hong Kong citizens protest for their  right to live in a free and fair political system, an expectation they  fully have. Over the last several weeks, we have witnessed the  government become increasingly violent as it cracks down on protests.  It is sad to see death and destruction come to this beautiful and  energetic place.   For three decades, I have traveled to Hong Kong and witnessed their  innovative spirit and their extraordinary work ethic. In fact, Hong  Kong was the model for the post-World War II Asian  [[Page H9096]]  Tiger growth and prosperity now shared across the region. When a  proponent of welfare statism queried progrowth economist Melvyn B.  Krauss, ``But how many Hong Kongs can the world have?'' the professor  responded, ``As many as the world will allow itself.''   The 7 million citizens of Hong Kong are looking to us for a voice and  for leadership, and with today's vote, we will deliver. I call on  President Trump to sign this important measure into law with expediency  and show the world that America supports the people of Hong Kong, their  right to free expression, and their democratic governance guaranteed  under the five-decade arrangement agreed to in 1997 by the People's  Republic of China and the United Kingdom.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Smith for his leadership, and I urge all of  my colleagues to support this measure.
