 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 175 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 175         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 725) to amend title 28, United States Code, to       prevent fraudulent joinder. The first reading of the bill       shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. No       amendment to the bill shall be in order except those printed       in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution. Each such amendment may be offered only in the       order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member       designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall       be debatable for the time specified in the report equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,       shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject       to a demand for division of the question in the House or in       the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against such       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted.  [[Page H1612]]       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings)  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                general leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the  underlying legislation. Current Federal court rules allow trial lawyers  to engage in picking their preferred venue. In particular, trial  lawyers are able to file suit against the defendant in one State while  keeping their case in a different State's court.   When a lawsuit is filed against a defendant in another State, trial  lawyers may also sue a defendant in the State where they want the trial  to occur. This keeps the case in the lawyers' preferred State court.   Many times the target of the lawsuit is a large, national business.  But if the only defendant in the case is an out-of-State business, then  the case can be heard in Federal court. Because of this, the trial  lawyer will then also sue an innocent local individual or a small  business in order to keep the case before a local court.   Usually, the case against the innocent local defendant is dropped  once the case is safely back in State court, but it is dropped only  after the innocent local defendant has spent time and money dealing  with the lawsuit.   This practice is wrong. This practice perverts our justice system and  causes needless pain. Trial lawyers should not have the power to  subject innocent local individuals and small businesses to costly and  time-consuming lawsuits just to rig the system. This kind of abuse of  litigation is unjust and must be stopped.   A well-respected Federal appeals court judge, J. Harvie Wilkinson of  the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, has publicly supported Congress  putting an end to this abuse. He has suggested that Congress provide  judges greater leeway in making the proper decision on whether a case  should be removed to Federal court. He has also suggested that Congress  give Federal judges greater discretion to determine early on in a case  whether a local party has been fraudulently sued. The Innocent Party  Protection Act provides these exact changes.   In 2014 Judge Wilkinson addressed these proposals and said:         That is exactly the kind of approach to Federal       jurisdiction reform that I like because it is targeted.        And there is a problem with fraudulent jurisdiction law as       it exists today, I think, and that is that you have to       establish that the joinder of a nondiverse local defendant is       totally ridiculous and that there is no possibility of ever       recovering.    That is very hard to do.   So Judge Wilkinson went on:         So I think making the fraudulent joinder law a little bit       more realistic appeals to me because it seems to me the kind       of intermediate step that addresses some real problems.    The legislation that this rule makes in order is the solution to the  problem that Judge Wilkinson identifies. The underlying legislation  would protect innocent local defendants in two main ways. First, the  Innocent Party Protection Act allows Federal judges more leeway when  determining whether a defendant has been fraudulently joined to a  lawsuit for the purpose of keeping the case out of Federal court.   When a judge has a case before his or her court, the judge will have  clear guidelines for determining whether the locality of a defendant  can be disregarded in establishing whether the case will proceed in  Federal or State court. However, this in no way infringes on our State  court systems.   The judge must conclude that the defendant will not face a liability  under applicable State law. Once that conclusion is reached, the judge  then may release the innocent defendant from the case. This provision  keeps legal claims in Federal Court that properly belong there by  allowing Federal judges to decide whether a local party is truly a  legitimate defendant and not simply ensnared in a case for the sole  purpose of keeping the case in a trial lawyer-friendly State court.  This is a fair and efficient solution to the problem.   Secondly, the Innocent Party Protection Act establishes a uniform  approach for evaluating whether a plaintiff has a good-faith intention  of seeking judgment against a local defendant.   While the U.S. Supreme Court has long recognized the right of courts  to consider whether a plaintiff has a good-faith intention of seeking a  judgment against a local defendant, the application of this principle  has not been uniform.   The Innocent Party Protection Act simply codifies this longstanding  principle and permits Federal judges to limit a lawsuit to the  appropriate defendant.   Plaintiffs with legitimate claims against both a local and out-of- State defendant will be able to pursue their case in State court.  However, if no legitimate claim exists, the out-of-State defendant will  have the opportunity to have the case heard in a neutral forum. By  codifying this principle, we effectively protect innocent individuals  and small businesses from bad-faith litigation.   Mr. Speaker, the underlying legislation is a fair solution to one  type of frivolous litigation. I support this effort, and I thank  Chairman Goodlatte and the Judiciary Committee for bringing this bill  to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the gentleman from Florida that  we are debating the special order of business from rules and that all  comments must be relevant to the rule or the underlying bill.   This particular underlying bill has to do with a rule of civil  procedure and fraudulent joinders. It does not have to do with the  gentleman's healthcare replacement act or his thoughts on the  healthcare replacement act, insurance executive's compensation,  individual mandates, tax cuts for the rich, Russia, Iraq, although I  did appreciate the gentleman's memories from law school the year that I  was born.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Sessions).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Sessions).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa  (Mr. King).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Iowa.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Iowa for his  thoughts.   May I inquire how much time is remaining on my side?    Mr. Speaker, I would advise the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Hastings) that I have no additional speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, the rule before the House today is simple. It provides  for the consideration of the Innocent Party Protection Act.   Mr. Speaker, we often speak of the Federal regulations or taxes  inhibiting job growth in our country, but there are other headwinds  that our Nation's job creators face as well. One of those headwinds is  frivolous litigation.   I believe strongly that anyone and everyone should have access to  justice. Everyone who is injured deserves to have their day in court,  and they should have the opportunity to make their case. However,  sometimes trial lawyers take advantage of our justice system and seek  to gain an unfair advantage against a defendant. Trial lawyers may try  to go court shopping in order to rig the case against the defendant.   One way they may seek to secure their preferred venue is to sue a  perfectly innocent individual or a small business who happens to reside  in the jurisdiction within which the trial lawyer desires to pursue the  case. After some time, the innocent party is often released from the  litigation, but not before incurring legal costs as well as emotional  and opportunity costs. Each time an innocent small-business man or  woman has to divert their attention from growing their business and  divert resources away from investing in their employees and creating  jobs and divert energy away from expanding their involvement in our  communities, and instead they are forced to direct their attention  toward defending themselves from a frivolous legal claim, each time  this happens is a missed opportunity for creating jobs and for  realizing economic growth.    The Innocent Party Protection Act defends our small-business men and  women from bad faith lawsuits. It provides relief from trial lawyers  who seek out friendly courts in order to pursue their cases. It  balances the needs of justice with proper restraints on decidedly  unjust actions. The Innocent Party Protection Act is a good and  equitable solution. I ask my colleagues in the House to support our  local businesses and defend them against frivolous lawsuits. Vote  ``yes'' on the resolution. Vote ``yes'' on the underlying bill. Rein in  this abuse of our justice system. I thank Chairman Goodlatte and  Chairman Sessions for bringing this bill before us.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 175 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       section:        Sec. 2. In rule XXI add the following new clause:        13. (a) It shall not be in order to consider a bill or       joint resolution proposing to repeal or amend the Patient       Protection and Affordable Care Act (PL 111-148) and the       Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of       2010 (PL 111-152), or part thereof, in the House, in the       Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, or in       the Committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means,       unless an easily searchable electronic estimate and       comparison prepared by the Director of the Congressional       Budget Office is made available on a publicly available       website of the House.        (b) It shall not be in order to consider a rule or order       that waives the application of paragraph (a).                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
