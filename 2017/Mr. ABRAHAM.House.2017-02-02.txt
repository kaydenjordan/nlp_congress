 Mr. Speaker, I am honored to introduce this resolution  with my good friend, Representative Sam Johnson of Texas, one of the  greatest patriots I have had the honor to come in contact with and a  lifelong defender of our freedoms in America.   This resolution can be boiled down to one point: no bureaucrat should  be able to deny an American his or her constitutional rights just  because someone else handles their finances.   In the midnight hour of President Obama's last days in office, the  Social Security Administration finalized a rule that would allow it to  send the name of any beneficiary to the FBI's criminal background check  system if they are assigned a representative payee due to mental  impairment.   Allowing bureaucrats at the Social Security Administration to  determine whether or not a beneficiary is fit to exercise their Second  Amendment rights is a clear violation of due process that every  American is afforded.   When this awful rule was proposed in 2015, both Representative Sam  Johnson of Texas and I introduced legislation to prevent the Social  Security Administration from carrying it out. With the introduction of  this joint resolution, I am pleased that Congress and the President  will now have the opportunity to review and to reverse this terrible  rule.   That is why I strongly urge my colleagues, in both the House and the  Senate, to pass this resolution and keep the government bureaucracies  from putting themselves before the Constitution.
