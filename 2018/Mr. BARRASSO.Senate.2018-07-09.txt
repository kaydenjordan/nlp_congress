 Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 125th  anniversary of the Hotel Wolf in Saratoga, WY. Known as the Grand Old  Lady of the Platte Valley, the hotel, which was once a hub for tie  hacks, railroad workers, and miners, has a rich legacy of service.   Hotel Wolf was established in 1883 by Frederick Wolf, a German  immigrant. In 1869, following his service as a soldier in the German  Army, he and his wife, Christina, came to America. He worked for the  Central Michigan Railroad before moving during the westward expansion.  Wolf was a foreman for the Union Pacific Railroad in Rawlins, WY. In  1887, Wolf moved to Saratoga, seeking relief from rheumatism in the  community famous for its local hot springs, which were believed to own  curative properties. It was here he conceived, built, and operated the  Hotel Wolf.   Wolf christened the building with a masquerade ball on New Year's Eve  and opened for guests January 10, 1894. The building quickly became a  popular local watering hole and destination for travelers moving  through the area. In addition, it was a stop along the C.M. Scribner  stage line, which ran between Encampment and Walcott. Today, Frederick  Wolf's great-great-grandson Neil Gorsuch serves with distinction as a  U.S. Supreme Court Justice.   Although the hotel has seen a number of changes since its opening,  its ownership has changed hands only five times. Several years after  Wolf's death in 1910, the hotel was sold to George ``Baldy'' Sisson,  who changed the name to Hotel Sisson. In 1937, Earl Moore purchased the  property, returning the hotel to its original name. Earl died in 1947,  and his wife, Mary, continued operations for the next 30 years. Under  Mary's leadership, the Hotel Wolf was listed on the National Register  of Historic Places in 1974. Finally, in 1977, Mary sold the property to  Doug and Kathleen Campbell and partner Michael Self. The partnership  ended in 1983, and Doug and Kathy became the hotel's sole proprietors.   The Campbells have been remarkable stewards ever since. Like Mary  Moore, they strive to preserve the architectural integrity of the  building. Every renovation or upgrade enhances the hotel's spirit of  Western heritage. Guests who stay often remark on the authentic decor  and friendly staff. Their excellent hospitality was rewarded with the  2018 ``Big WYO'' Award from the Wyoming Lodging and Restaurant  Association and the Wyoming Department of Tourism. This year, the  Campbells will celebrate 41 years of hotel ownership. In 2017, Doug and  Kathy celebrated 50 years of marriage. These milestones are certainly  worthy of recognition and praise.   The Hotel Wolf has several exciting events planned in honor of its  125th anniversary. In addition to a commemorative menu, vintage  merchandise, and a family photo gallery, nationally recognized author  C. J. Box will host a signing of his latest book, ``The Disappeared.''  The book references room No. 9 of the historic hotel. Box, who owns a  cabin in Riverside, WY, is well-known throughout the Platte River  Valley, having served as the director of Saratoga's Chamber of  Commerce.   It is an honor to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the Hotel Wolf.  I share my thanks with Doug and Kathy Campbell for their incredible  stewardship of this historic gem. I am certain their children Jason and  D'Ron Campbell, Judd Campbell and Nora Asbury, and Meghan and Torrey  Pedersen--as well as the memory of Kirsten Campbell--are equally as  proud. Doug and Kathy also have seven grandchildren: Kaitlyn, Jaden,  Douglass, and Anthony Campbell, Burgan and Ava Campbell, and Simon  Pedersen.   I invite my colleagues to visit the Hotel Wolf and Saratoga to  experience all that the remarkable Platte River Valley has to offer.                            ____________________
