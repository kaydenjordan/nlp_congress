 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, as negotiations continue on a  continuing resolution to keep the government open past next week, we  should be laying the groundwork to process the 12 appropriations bills  for fiscal year 2020.   In an ideal world, the Republicans on the Appropriations Committee  would be negotiating in good faith with the Democrats on the  Appropriations Committee to determine the allocations and the content  of those bills, but the Republicans, unfortunately, have not chosen to  do this. They are acting in a totally partisan way. The Republicans  have chosen to back the President's demand for an additional $12  billion in funding for his border wall, taken from other sources,  including medical research, opioid treatment, and funding intended for  our military, their families, and their kids. Mexico, oddly, isn't  chipping in a penny.   This was all done totally on the Republican side with there having  been no consultation of the Democrats and, certainly, no buy-in. So, of  course, the Democrats oppose taking funds from Congress to use on the  President's border wall that have been intended for our military.  Everyone knows that. In fact, 12 Senate Republicans opposed the very  same thing this year, but in typical Washington, blame-game fashion,  Republican leader Mitch McConnell has been accusing the Democrats of  threatening to block military funding because we don't want to pass a  bill that steals money from the military. That is right. The Democrats  are the ones threatening not to vote for this bill because we oppose a  Republican bill that would shortchange the military.   I have heard some howlers in my day, but that is pretty rich, what  McConnell is saying.   Leader McConnell constantly talks about stunts. He doesn't like  stunts because they won't be signed or passed into law. This is a stunt  if I have ever seen one, that of putting this bill--$12 billion more  for the wall and with no buy-in by the Democrats--to a vote. It will  lose. We know it will lose.   What is the point, Leader McConnell? You say you don't like stunts.  You say you don't want to bring bills to the floor that won't become  law. Well, this one certainly won't.   The fact is the Republican leader knows well that the Democrats  oppose taking funding away from our troops to use on the President's  wall. He knows that Members of his own caucus oppose taking money out  of their States to spend on the President's border wall. Some have been  quite vocal; yet Leader McConnell is moving forward with the bill all  the same, knowing that it lacks votes.   For him to say the Democrats are the ones threatening to block  military funding when, in fact, we oppose a Republican bill that would  shortchange the military is the height of double talk by the Republican  leader.   Again, the Republican leader is fond of reminding the press that he  doesn't like to engage in stunts--that the Senate is for making laws  and is not a forum for political theater. Yet putting this bill on the  floor of the Senate that everyone knows lacks the votes is the  definition of a stunt.   Leader McConnell--and I mean this with all due respect--it is time to  negotiate. Both sides must sit down and have a serious negotiation--no  stunts, no blame game. The Democrats want to work with our Republican  colleagues, but we need a willing partner, and time is quickly running  out to get a bipartisan appropriations process back on track.    Madam President, I rise tonight to join the chorus of  Democratic Senators in this Chamber demanding action to address the  American gun violence epidemic. We stand here tonight on behalf of the  tens of millions of Americans, from one end of the country to the  other, who are crying out for change.   Every few months, it seems that our Nation is rocked by another  horrifying mass shooting. El Paso and Dayton are only the latest  entries in our national register of tragedy, a list that stretches from  Parkland to Pittsburgh, Charleston to Columbine, Aurora to Orlando,  Blacksburg to Binghamton, San Bernardino to Sandy Hook, and to Las  Vegas. Because that ever-growing list can sometimes seem abstract,  let's not forget about the specific places where these awful shootings  occurred: movie theaters and night clubs, shopping malls and office  parks, music festivals and traffic stops, churches, synagogues,  mosques, colleges, high schools, and an elementary school.   Our hearts remain with the families of the victims and the survivors  of these mass shootings whose lives were turned upside down in an  instance by mad men who never should have had access to a gun. The  touching letter that Senator Murphy read from one of his constituents  whose child died in Sandy Hook is just one of many testaments to that  turning upside down--instantly ruining your life forever by one of  these horrible, awful incidents.   At the same time, our hearts are with tens of thousands more whose  lives were ended or forever altered by everyday gun violence. It  doesn't make the headlines, but we remember them, too. They are no less  tragic and no less painful for the parents who lost children, and  brothers and sisters, sons and daughters who lost mothers and fathers.   Whether it is a mass shooting or an individual shooting, people who  shouldn't have guns are killing our fellow American citizens, and  Congress just sits on its hands--the Senate does, anyway--and does  nothing.   Let me mention a few stories of New Yorkers whose lives were cut  short by gun violence just this year. The list goes on and on, I assure  you.   Norzell Aldridge, of Cheektowaga in western New York, was a youth  football coach. He was shot in the chest and killed a few weeks ago  while trying to break up a fight at a park in Buffalo's East Side.  Coach Aldridge's team had just finished playing the first game of their  season.   Rhyan Williams-Cannon, a 21-year-old from Syracuse, was shot and  killed in March as he was leaving the corner store. He was the youngest  of seven siblings. He had just earned his GED in October. Rhyan's  family said he was like a father to his nephew, sneaking candies to him  behind his mother's back.   Shakeel Khan, of Johnson City, was murdered by a mass gunman in April  while closing up his restaurant. Shakeel was the sole provider for his  wife and his three children, aged 14, 12, and 8.   May God rest their souls.   I can stand here for hours and tell 100 more stories, each one as  heartbreaking as the next. Each one is about senseless violence that  might not have occurred if we had adequate laws on the books, all the  people around them--their families, their friends, their communities-- devastated by the recklessness, senselessness of this gun violence.   It is our solemn duty to the victims of those terrible tragedies who  can't speak for themselves, but their memories call down to us for  justice, to cure this terrible plague of gun violence that claims tens  of thousands of lives every single day of every single year.   I have been fighting this fight for such a long time. Back in 1993, I  was in my sixth term representing Brooklyn and Queens in the House of  Representatives. I knew the terrible toll of gun violence firsthand  because the streets of my community were testimony to it. East New York  and Cypress Hills were known as the Killing Grounds back then because  someone was murdered an average of once every 63 hours, so I was more  than eager to help write, introduce, and pass the legislation  establishing our background check system that later became known as the  Brady Bill.   As we take stock of the legacy of that bill 25 years later, there is  no question that it saved countless lives. There are literally  thousands and thousands of people walking the streets of their  communities who are alive today and would have been dead had the Brady  Law not passed. We don't know who they are. They don't know who they  are. But we know they are alive, and we are thankful for it.   Ever since the National Instant Criminal Background Check System went  online in 1998, there have been more than 1.5 million denials to  disqualified buyers. The ability to keep guns out of the hands of  convicted felons has helped lead to a steep drop in murder rates  experienced by communities across the country.   Take my hometown of New York City. In the early 1990s, before the  Brady Bill was enacted, an average of 2,500 people were murdered every  year in the five boroughs. Last year, that number was just 289.   But that doesn't mean our work is done--far from it. What seemed like  a minor compromise in 1993--allowing the sale of firearms without  background checks at gun shows--has become a massive loophole. At the  time when I wrote the Brady Bill, gun shows were a place for collectors  to sell antiques, but gun shows have grown exponentially in popularity  because people who don't want background checks know they can get guns  there and people who want to sell guns to people who don't go through  background checks sell their guns there. And even of greater dimension,  the internet exploded to facilitate private sales between strangers, no  questions asked.   While some cities like New York have thankfully seen an overall  decrease in gun deaths, there are still too  [[Page S5537]]  many pockets in cities across the country where this epidemic persists.  At the same time, the frequency and lethality of mass shootings have  rapidly increased.   The internet allows for copycats. People up to no good see someone  else has killed many people and think that maybe they should do the  same. We have seen the frequency of these awful mass shootings continue  on and on.   We finally have an opportunity to close that loophole and keep guns  from falling into the wrong hands in the first place. We have the  opportunity to simply update the Brady Law--not change it, not expand  it, just plug the holes that were punctured in it as time moved  forward. No gun will be taken away from someone who is a law-abiding  citizen by this law. No, only people who shouldn't have guns will not  get them. And who could disagree with that? Certainly not the American  people who are overwhelmingly on our side.   We Senate Democrats are here tonight because the House of  Representatives has finally passed legislation closing the private sale  loophole, marking the first time that either Chamber of Congress has  passed an overhaul of a background check system since the Brady law  more than 25 years ago.   What we are asking for is very simple and shouldn't cause us to come  here at night. It should be an obvious thing to do: a simple up-or-down  vote on legislation--an up-or-down vote on H.R. 8.   Let me say it again. Leader McConnell, put H.R. 8 up for a vote on  the floor of the Senate as soon as possible. Let us do what we were  sent here to do by our constituents--what our constituents demand we  do, which is fix the most pressing problems facing our Nation. If we  fail to do so, it is plain and simple and terrible: More innocent  people will die.   Before I yield the floor, I want to thank the survivors and families  of victims who have done so much to remind the American people of just  what is at stake when it comes to gun violence. I keep on a desk in my  office pictures of the children who were murdered in Sandy Hook given  to me by their ailing and grieving parents. And those parents and the  thousands and thousands of others like them--survivors who amazingly  choose to light a candle to prevent greater darkness despite the  darkness that had overcome their lives and that has surrounded their  lives, these are beautiful people, saint-like people--and we thank  them.   A year and a half ago, we watched in horror as tragedy struck the  Parkland community in Florida. Once again, the safety and sanctuary of  a school was torn apart by the unthinkable, but this time felt  different. Almost immediately, the students started speaking out,  turning their immeasurable pain into courageous advocacy. Just 2 weeks  later, I welcomed these Parkland teens into my office. My God, what  courage, what fortitude, what inner strength. Even in the darkest of  nights, some choose not to curse the darkness but to light a candle.   A few weeks later, I joined millions of New Yorkers who were inspired  to march for change by these Parkland teens. Millions more Americans  across the country did the same. And now, a little more than a year  later, this Senate has the opportunity to vote on H.R. 8, universal  background checks, among several other pieces of legislation passed by  the House that would save lives from gun violence.   Times have changed. People forget that the Brady Bill was first  introduced in 1987, 6 years after Jim Brady and President Reagan were  wounded and more than 6 years before it was enacted into law. Now, we  are moving from tragedy to action in a year. The movement that Jim and  Sarah Brady started in the 1980s has reached a new era. The American  people are no longer willing to wait months or years for change. Long  gone are the days that Senate Republicans can just bury their heads in  the sand and ignore that more than 30,000 Americans are killed by a gun  every year. Politicians offering their thoughts and prayers just  doesn't cut it anymore. It is put up or shut up.    Leader McConnell, Senate Republicans, what will you do?   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
