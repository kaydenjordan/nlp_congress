 Madam President, I rise with my colleagues to just tell  stories I am hearing from Virginians. Having completed a campaign last  November, I was out doing a lot of listening and have continued to do a  lot of listening since then. In your own mind, you kind of categorize  the stories, and, first, above all else, are stories about healthcare.  I hear stories about a lot of things, but I hear stories about  healthcare probably as much as all other areas combined. In the area of  healthcare, the issue of the price of prescription drugs is No. 1.   Hundreds of Virginians have reached out to me to let me know about  the high cost of prescription drugs and how that affects not only their  health but even their ability to put food on their table or a roof over  their heads. Today I want to share some stories from Virginians and  then talk about some commonsense legislation and a present opportunity  to bring drug prices down.   Andrew from Great Falls shared this story with me. His father was  being treated for CML, which is a leukemia that is effectively curable,  and he was prescribed the drug Gleevec. Now, this story goes back a  little bit, and here is what Andrew said:         In the United States, Gleevec costs approximately $159 to       manufacture for a year's dose.    That is the manufactured cost.         In India, a generic version of this drug costs about $400 a       year to purchase for use. In Canada, the price is around       $8,800 a year for a generic of the drug, and $38,000 a year       for the branded drug. In the United States, there is no       available generic, and the brand name drug's marketing cost       is $146,000 a year. This is not a drug that consumers can       simply choose to take or not take--to be blunt, they will . .       . literally die of cancer if they don't take it.    Now, since Andrew wrote me the letter, a generic has been approved in  the United States that has provided him and other families relief, but  for a long period of time, $146,000 in the United States for a drug  that costs $159 to manufacture, and the price to patients in other  countries is dramatically less.   Daniel from Martinsville in Southern Virginia wrote to me about the  high price of insulin, which is a common theme, I know, for all of us  here with constituents.   He writes:         I paid $505.00 for 3 bottles of Humalog Insulin . . . at       Walgreens. This is a three month supply, but another Eli       Lilly insulin is required by my wife in order for her to       avoid death [and that is hundreds of dollars more].    Laurie from Norfolk wrote to me to share her story. Laurie has  rheumatoid arthritis, and she lives on Social Security. She writes:         The drug company wants $65,000 for the drug. With my       Medicare part D, they only want $8,000--[that is good, but       that is] over 1/3 of my annual income [as a senior on Social       Security for one drug]. I have applied for the drug companies       patient assistance program [because] the pain is too great. I       can't use my hand without the drug. The drug companies are       getting away with robbery. We need Medicare to have the       authority to negotiate drug prices.    Ron from Arlington, just across the Potomac, wrote me after he went  to renew a prescription he had been taking for more than a year.         That is an outrageous increase of 100 percent or $100 more       out of my pocket for exactly the same thing [every time I buy       it]. I am a retired federal employee on a limited income and       I am locked into this insurance plan for the rest of the       year. So I have to take $100 more out of my pocket to obtain       the exact same thing.    Every time he buys it, 100 percent increase in the price.   Marie from Virginia Beach wrote me about a drug that costs $375,000 a  year. She writes:         Without the drug I most likely will be bedridden. I cannot       afford the exorbitant price. . . . I recognize the recovery       cost of research is the main expense, since manufacturing       cost is extremely cheap, but when the sufferers cannot afford       your drug, then what have you gained?    Medicare is prohibited from negotiating the price of prescription  drugs. Medicare Part D enrolls over 43 million seniors nationwide,  giving the program incredible bargaining power if it could only be used  for their benefit.   Many seniors are on fixed incomes. The average senior gets Social  Security. Their median income is $28,000, so an $8,000 drug cost is  one-third to a quarter of their income. In the wealthiest Nation in the  world, seniors should not have to choose between paying for their  medication and putting food on the table or heating their home. So many  of these seniors tell me about getting medication and then thinking: If  I cut the pill in half and just take half a dose, maybe I can save some  money--but that then comes at an incredible reduction in the efficacy  of the prescription you are taking to control your healthcare  condition.   This is why I joined with Senator Klobuchar, and I appreciate her  organizing this group of us on the floor today, to introduce the  Empowering Medicare Seniors to Negotiate Drug Prices Act, which allows  Medicare to negotiate drug prices. This is simple, basic, best business  practice. Everybody will negotiate prices. Why should we bar the  Medicare Part D Program that provides a prescription drug benefit to 43  million people--why should we bar them from negotiating for drug  prices?    According to a recent analysis, Medicare would have saved $14.4  billion. That is billion with a ``b.'' Medicare would have saved $14.4  billion on just 50 drugs in 2016 if the program had paid the same  prices as the Department of Veterans Affairs, which is allowed to  negotiate. That is a whole separate level of absurdity. Why would we,  as Congress, allow the Department of Veterans Affairs, as they buy  these same drugs from the same manufacturers, to negotiate and get a  volume discount but tell the Medicare Program they  [[Page S2872]]  can't? We actually know how much money we would save because of  allowing the Veterans Affairs Department to negotiate, which they  should be able to, but why would we then handcuff Medicare Part D and  not allow them?   If Medicare would have saved $14.4 billion just in those 50 drugs in  1 year, that is $14.4 billion that could be used for better healthcare,  the deficit reduction, tax relief, Pell grants, education expenses.  There is also a savings not just to Medicare but to patients that would  also be in the billions.   Every corner pharmacy negotiates the price of prescription drugs.  Every Walmart does. When they are buying prescription drugs to sell in  their pharmacy, they negotiate based on volume. It makes no sense that  the Federal Government is not allowed to do the same thing.   Another area is biologic medicines. They represent a new and very  promising area of treatment. I do want to stop here and say I am not  one of these people who use a big broad brush and say pharmaceutical  companies are bad. Why are we living longer? Why is the average age  going up and up and up? It is going up and up and up because of better  medical care, and much of that medical care and improvement is  innovation in the pharmaceutical industry, so I am not on a campaign to  say pharmaceutical companies are bad. They are producing lifesaving  prescriptions that are easing suffering and prolonging life. It is just  that the price Americans pay for those drugs is so far out of whack  with what other nations do, and one of the things that is innovative,  that is great is biologic medicines.   When competing products--they are called biosimilars--attempt to  enter the market, they often find it impossible to navigate the thicket  of patent laws that protect the branded product because they lack  access to readily accessible information. So when biosimilar  manufacturers are able to uncover the web of patents, expensive  litigation too often results in patents being found to be invalid or  unenforceable.   That is why I joined with Senator Collins from Maine on a second bill  to introduce the Biologic Patent Transparency Act. Our bill promotes  patent transparency by requiring manufacturers of approved products to  disclose and list patents covering their products with the FDA in what  we call the FDA Purple Book. The legislation encourages manufacturers  to apply for patents sooner, allow prospective biosimilar manufacturers  to challenge weaker or invalid patents earlier in the product  development process to eliminate waste, and the legislation will help  us bring needed biosimilar treatments to patients faster and ultimately  help lower drug prices.   Finally, a word about insulin. Over 30 million people--that is like  the combined population of about 19 or 20 States--live with diabetics  in the United States, and insulin is a critical and life-sustaining  daily treatment for 7\1/2\ million of those people. Yet, between 2012  and 2016, spending on insulin nearly doubled, even while there was  little change in the actual use of insulin. So what explains that?   The price hikes we have experienced have caused Virginians who need  these drugs, whose stories I have indicated, to endure severe financial  hardship, ration their supplies, or even skip the needed medication.   In February, I joined all my Democratic colleagues on the Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, where I sit with Senator  Smith, who preceded me, and we sent a letter to three insulin  manufacturers requesting information about recent price increases, how  the revenue contributes to research and development, and what companies  are doing to help patients access affordable insulin.   In closing, I said there are not only good ideas in Senator  Klobuchar's bill and in others, but there is also a good time. In the  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, our Chair, Senator  Alexander, and our ranking member, Senator Murray, have indicated that  one of the bills we want to work on this year is a bill of single-shot  strategies to reduce medical costs. It is not going to be the rewrite  of the healthcare system. Senator Alexander and Senator Murray were  heard to describe that if we can do a bill with a series of singles,  that would be a very good thing. So we will work together as colleagues  to come up with a series of strategies that could bring healthcare  costs down, and we have an opportunity in this bill to have some of  those provisions deal with provisions just like those I have described  that can reduce the cost of prescription drugs.   I am proud to join my colleagues to share stories of Virginians. It  is probably the single-most frequent complaint I hear, and it is a  complaint we can do something about.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President. Sexual assault is a major issue on our  Nation's college campuses. In 2016, the Department of Justice found  that one in four college women are sexually assaulted while in school.  Alarmingly, the majority of these crimes will go unreported. The  consequences of these crimes are often damaging to a student's mental,  physical, and emotional well-being and the aftermath can drive many  survivors to drop out of school.   Sexual assault survivors deserve access to a safe and supportive  educational environment. I have met with students in Virginia, most  recently at the University of Virginia and Virginia Tech, who have  expressed the need for someone on campus to turn to for unbiased  advice, guidance, and support following an assault. Given the  prevalence of this issue, it is clear that our federal higher education  policy must do more to prevent sexual assaults and ensure that  survivors have access to and can navigate through a plethora of  resources.   This is why I am pleased to reintroduce today the Survivor Outreach  and Support Campus Act of 2019 or SOS Campus Act. The SOS Campus Act  requires every institution of higher education that receives federal  funding to designate an independent advocate for campus sexual assault  prevention and response. The advocate will help students access all of  the resources available to them, both on and off campus, in the wake of  a sexual assault and will guide them through the process of reporting  their assault if they choose to do so, acting always in the interests  of the victim, not the university.   The SOS Campus Act requires that the confidential advocate is  responsible for ensuring that survivors, regardless of whether they  decide to report the crime, have access to emergency and follow-up  medical care, guidance on reporting assaults to law enforcement,  medical forensic or evidentiary exams, crisis intervention, and  information on their legal rights. The advocate will also conduct a  public information campaign on campus to inform students of their  services, and train other university staff to provide information to  students about the advocate.   I am proud to reintroduce this legislation with Senators Baldwin,  Hirono and Feinstein, which would ensure all college students across  our country have access to a supportive advocate for sexual assault  survivors. It is our responsibility as public servants to advocate  relentlessly for reforms to prevent sexual assault and protections for  survivors. I strongly encourage my colleagues in the Senate to consider  this legislation when we consider reauthorization of the Higher  Education Act.                                  ______                                         By Mr. MANCHIN:   S. 1486. A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, to include  certain pension as administrative expenses in bankruptcy, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
