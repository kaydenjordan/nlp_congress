 Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about  possibly the most important bill this House has passed in recent years.   Yesterday, we passed the American Rescue Plan, a bill that spends  $1.9 trillion to crush the virus and protect our economy. For the  cities in my district, this means $615 million to Houston, $42 million  for Pasadena, $2.3 million for Galena Park, $3.8 million fo11-15r South  Houston, and $2.2 million for San Jacinto City.   That is money that keeps first responders on the job. That is money  that keeps our water running and our trash picked up, and it is also  money that keeps families together.   But beyond the numbers, this is the greatest antipoverty bill since  Social Security. This bill cuts Hispanic poverty by 39 percent and  African-American poverty by 42 percent.   Madam Speaker, we have to continue to build on these efforts. I want  to thank all of my colleagues for coming together to fight poverty on a  scale that we truly need.                            ____________________
