 Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on two nominees  to the U.S. Sentencing Commission who should have been confirmed last  year. Judge Danny Reeves was nominated more than 1 year ago, and he was  unanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee; yet Senate Republicans  refused to approve him before the end of last year. Judge Charles  Breyer was nominated last September for a reappointment, and despite  overwhelming support, Republicans blocked him as well. These are not  controversial nominees, and there is no good reason they were blocked  last year. In fact, in ordinary times, these nominees would be  unanimously confirmed during wrap-up on the Senate floor.                               richard boulware    Mr. President, one nominee we are not considering today is Judge  Richard Boulware, whom President Obama nominated in 2015 to fill a seat  on the Sentencing Commission previously held by Judge Ketanji Brown  Jackson. Judge Boulware was confirmed to serve as a district judge in  June 2014, becoming the first African-American man to serve on the U.S.  District Court for the District of Nevada. His nomination to the  Sentencing Commission had the strong support of the Leadership  Conference on Civil and Human Rights, which said that Judge Boulware  would ``bring a much needed and valuable perspective to the work of the  Commission because of his experience.'' Judge Boulware clerked in the  Southern District of New York, served as a Federal public defender, and  represented the Las Vegas branch of the NAACP on a range of issues,  including voting rights, police cameras, and solitary confinement.   Despite his clear qualifications, Senate Republicans blocked Judge  Boulware, and his nomination was returned to the White House at the end  of last year. President Trump renominated Judge Reeves and Judge  Breyer, but I am disappointed that he failed to do the same for Judge  Boulware. The Sentencing Commission does not have a single person of  Color serving as a commissioner; yet its work on criminal justice  issues has a significant effect on communities of color. Judge Boulware  should have been confirmed last year, along with Judge Reeves and Judge  Breyer. While I support the two nominees before us today, I want the  Record to note my deep disappointment and concern that Judge Boulware  is not among them.   For nearly a decade, I have worked with Senators from both parties on  bipartisan legislation to reform our criminal justice system. The  Sentencing Commission has also studied the issue and brought about  needed change to the sentencing guidelines. The Bureau of Prisons  continues to consume nearly a quarter of the Justice Department's  budget, even as violent crime rates have gone down; but instead of  taking meaningful steps to reduce these costs, the Trump-Sessions  Justice Department has signaled it intends to more aggressively charge  low-level offenders with crimes carrying mandatory minimums. The  Attorney General also lifted restrictions on the use of private prisons  that serve only the interest of wealthy corporations. This is deeply  troubling on moral grounds. Incarceration should not be a for-profit  business. It is also troubling to me in my role as vice chairman of the  Appropriations Committee. Instead of wasting taxpayer dollars on  private prisons, we should be directing our limited resources to train  and protect officers on the streets and to reduce recidivism and crime.   The Sentencing Commission has brought much-needed fairness to the  Guidelines in the past, and I hope it will continue to do so once its  new members are confirmed, Although we should also be voting today on  Judge Boulware's nomination to the commission--rather, we should have  voted on it last year--I will support the nominations of Judge Breyer  and Judge Reeves.                              breyer nomination     Mr. President, last Thursday the Trump administration  submitted its first budget blueprint to Congress. The President called  it ``America First, A Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again.''  The title would seem like a ``Saturday Night Live'' skit if the topic  were not so serious. Like some of the President's tweets, his budget is  a hasty list of appallingly unbalanced, shortsighted, and, I believe,  politically driven priorities.   He proposes to eliminate or drastically cut programs that benefit the  middle class and safeguard its most vulnerable citizens, programs that  protect our environment, programs that promote our interests overseas  but also security at home. Instead, he wants to spend billions upon  billions of taxpayer dollars on a misguided wall along our southern  border and increased spending for the Pentagon.   He says his proposal causes ``strength, security and resolve.'' He  couldn't be more wrong. You don't want to make America ``great again''  at the expense of middle-class families and the most vulnerable among  us. We are not a ``great'' nation if we abandon our shared desire to  cure cancer, the desire to bring an end to Alzheimer's disease or  diabetes. We don't do that by slashing billions for the National  Institutes of Health. You can't switch complex and promising medical  research off and then say: Well, maybe someday later we will just turn  it back on again.   We are not a great nation if we eliminate heating assistance for the  6 million vulnerable households that receive LIHEAP. Some 21,000 of  those households just had to dig themselves out from a historic  snowstorm in my State of Vermont. And we are not a ``great'' nation if  we don't protect the air we breathe and the water we drink.   You don't make America stronger by eliminating the very programs that  strengthen our alliances around the world and make our Nation more  secure. We are not a strong nation if we simply pour more money into  the Pentagon but then renege on commitments to international  peacekeeping and security alliances or slash funding to respond to  humanitarian crises or cut our diplomatic presence around the world.  Interesting enough, when the other body spent millions of tax dollars  to investigate a lack of security in Benghazi and came up with nothing,  this budget slashes huge amounts that could be spent on security in our  embassies, just as they voted to cut out hundreds of millions of  dollars from a Senate budget that would have improved our security.   The President says he prefers hard power to soft power, but it is not  either/or. The notion that soft power is weak or wasteful is mindless.  If you are cutting programs that feed millions or prevent AIDS or treat  tuberculosis and malaria, well, that doesn't help. It makes the world  less stable, less secure.   I am afraid the budget proposal is divorced from reality. It has a  lot of partisan campaign promises. He promises infrastructure  investment--and all of us would agree with that--but then it cuts  critical Federal funds for proven successful State transportation  projects. He claims it will save rural America, but he cuts those  Federal programs that spur rural economic development. That is not a  budget with vision.   We need a serious budget proposal--a proposal that acknowledges the  devastating effects the Budget Control Act and sequestration have had  in our country and a budget that charts a path forward, rather than  doubling down on further cuts on programs for the middle class. We need  a budget proposal investing in our citizens and in our military, not a  proposal that pays for one at the expense of the other.   We have a lot of work to do. I am the vice chairman of the Senate  Appropriations Committee. I would say we have  [[Page S1870]]  to finish the fiscal year 2017 appropriations bills and then get to  work on fiscal year 2018. Anybody who has been a Governor of their  State would recognize that because they know they have to do it in  their State. We should do it for the United States. To accomplish that,  we need a budget framework that respects the principles in the  Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, including parity between the defense and  nondefense spending and that, even though they might be politically  popular, doesn't have poison pill riders. We need relief from  sequestration, not more misguided cuts.   This budget proposal takes us backward, not forward. But we can  remind ourselves that it is Congress that holds the power of the purse,  not the President. I have said that, whether we had Democratic or  Republican Presidents. I take the responsibility seriously. I look  forward to working across the aisle with colleagues both on and off the  Appropriations Committee. I want to craft a responsible budget, a  thoughtful budget, a serious budget--one that truly makes us a better  and safer Nation and reflects the values we share as Americans.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, article 2 of chapter I of the Charter of  the Organization of American States, of which Ecuador is a party,  states that one of the OAS's purposes is ``to promote and consolidate  representative democracy, with due respect for the principle of  nonintervention.''   I mention this because the second round of Ecuador's Presidential  election is scheduled for April 2, less than 2 weeks away. In the first  round, Lenin Moreno, who is supported by outgoing President Correa,  received 39 percent and his opponent, Guillermo Lasso, received 28  percent, so it is a hotly contested election.   But democracy is about more than elections. There is no institution  more fundamental to democracy than a free and independent press. A free  press helps protect the rule of law, to ensure that no person or group  is above the rules and procedures that govern a democratic society. A  free press helps ensure transparency to prod governments to be honest  and accountable to their citizens.   Although wavering at times, Ecuador has a history of democratic  government of which its citizens can be proud. It has a long tradition  of recognizing the importance of freedom of the press. Ecuador's first  constitution, written in 1830, stipulated that ``every citizen can  express their thoughts and publish them freely through the press.''  Ecuador's 1998 constitution guaranteed the right of journalists and  social communicators to ``seek, receive, learn, and disseminate''  events of general interest, with the goal of ``preserving the values of  the community.'' Even Ecuador's current constitution protects the right  ``to voice one's opinion and express one's thinking freely and in all  of its forms and manifestations,'' and the right to ``associate,  assemble and express oneself freely and voluntarily.''   Yet, since President Correa was first elected, freedom of the press  has been under assault. He has called the independent press his  ``greatest enemy.'' He sought to intimidate and silence his critics in  the media and civil society, like Janet Hinostroza, El Universo,  Vanguardia, El Comercio, Xavier Bonilla, and Fundamedios. He publicly  vilified Dr. Catalina Botero, a respected Colombian lawyer and former  OAS Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression. He pursued criminal  charges against columnists and newspaper owners who had criticized his  policies. During this period, the number of state-owned media  organizations exploded, growing from just one government-run news  outlet to a media conglomerate that today is made up of more than a  dozen outlets echoing the government's self-serving declarations. These  actions are a threat to democracy, and they damaged relations with the  United States.   On April 2, when the people of Ecuador elect their next President,  they alone will decide Ecuador's future. What is important at this  stage is to ensure that the electoral process is free and fair, that  the press can participate freely, and that the election is open to  international observers, including the OAS.   Whoever wins on April 2, I hope Ecuador's next President is someone  who genuinely believes in the freedoms of  [[Page S1885]]  expression and association that are enshrined in Ecuador's  Constitution. I hope he defends the right of a free press, an  independent judiciary, and the right of civil society organizations to  function without government interference. These rights are part of the  foundation of the representative democracy referenced in the OAS  Charter. The alternative is unaccountable government. That is, in fact,  where Ecuador was heading, after President Correa orchestrated the  adoption of a new constitution in order to run for reelection in 2009  and again in 2013.   I hope the result on April 2 will signify a commitment to uphold  Ecuador's Constitution and the beginning of a new relationship with the  United States, based on a common devotion to the fundamental rights of  citizens.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to call the Senate's attention to  the current situation in Guatemala, where upholding the rule of law has  too often been the exception rather than the rule.   For centuries, most Guatemalans had no access to justice. This was  exacerbated during--and in the years since--the civil war, when an  estimated 200,000 people were killed or disappeared. Most of them were  innocent victims of the armed forces, and only a small number of the  military officers and their accomplices who were responsible have been  punished. In fact, the armed forces and their benefactors have for the  most part successfully avoided justice, by threatening prosecutors and  witnesses and paying off judges.   At the same time, Guatemala is experiencing the corrosive effects of  drug gangs, smugglers, and organized crime. Former President Perez  Molina is under arrest, and other high-ranking officials have been  implicated in corruption. Rampant gang violence and a lack of job  opportunities have caused tens of thousands of Guatemalans, including  unaccompanied minors, to seek safety and employment in the United  States.   Two individuals, Thelma Aldana, Guatemala's Attorney General, and  Ivan Velasquez, the head of CICIG, the International Commission Against  Impunity in Guatemala, have been courageously investigating these high- profile cases and working diligently to bring those responsible to  justice. Both are respected former judges, Aldana a Guatemalan and  Velasquez a Colombian.   The United States, with the support of Democrats and Republicans in  Congress, has provided funding to both of their offices.   It is difficult, dangerous work. They have received anonymous threats  in an attempt to intimidate them, and there is a concern that President  Morales may oppose the renewal of Mr. Velasquez's term of duty, which  ends in September, or request the U.N. Secretary General to remove or  replace Mr. Velasquez.   This would be of great concern because no democracy can survive  without the rule of law, and there can be no rule of law without  independent investigators, prosecutors, and judges.   In Guatemala, with its history of impunity, Thelma Aldana and Ivan  Velasquez are making history by showing the Guatemalan people that  justice is possible. It is possible even in cases in which the  perpetrators are high-ranking government officials, members of their  families, or others with wealth and power who have long evaded justice.   Guatemala needs our support to reduce poverty and malnutrition,  improve education, combat crime, reform the police, and strengthen its  economy and public institutions, but none of that can be achieved or  sustained without political will and a transparent, accountable justice  system. I know this from my own experience, first as a prosecutor, and  more recently as the senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.   I have been here a long time, in fact longer than any other Senator.  I know Guatemala's history and the daunting challenges it faces. Its  people deserve better, and they need leaders who respect the rule of  law.   If Guatemala's leaders support Thelma Aldana and Ivan Velasquez for  as long they are willing to make the personal sacrifice and continue  their important work, we will do our part by supporting the Alliance  for Prosperity, but if there are attempts to undermine or curtail the  work of these two outstanding prosecutors, then Guatemala's leaders  should look elsewhere for support.                            ____________________     Mr. President, for over a decade, Vermont has been named  one of the healthiest States in the Nation. For those who know the  tireless dedication of Vermont's Commissioner of Health, Dr. Harry  Chen, this fact is not surprising. Dr. Chen recently made the difficult  decision to not seek reappointment. He leaves behind a legacy which  future leaders will undoubtedly follow.   Dr. Chen has long graced Vermont as a top leader in healthcare.  Before his appointment as health commissioner in 2011, Dr. Chen served  in the Vermont House of Representatives from 2004 to 2008 and in his  last term was the vice chair of the Health Care Committee. In 2008, he  was honored with the Physician Award for Community Service by the  Vermont State Medical Society.   Prior to his election to the State legislature, Dr. Chen worked for  more than 20 years as an emergency room physician and medical director  at the Rutland Regional Medical Center. Dr. Chen also served on the  clinical faculty at the University of Vermont's College of Medicine and  as vice chair of the University of Vermont's board of trustees. He  obtained his medical degree and completed his residency at the  University of Oregon's school of medicine as chief resident.   Dr. Chen's work to improve public health awareness and education has  long made Vermont a nationwide leader in healthcare. As Vermont's  Commissioner of Health since 2011 and briefly as the interim Secretary  of Health and Human Services from 2014 to 2015, Dr. Chen led the charge  to expand public health education and resources across the State. Dr.  Chen was especially instrumental in the fight against opioid and  substance abuse. I was proud when he testified at the field hearing I  held on the issue while ranking member of the Senate Judiciary  Committee in 2014. In the years after, he worked to strengthen State  resources for treatment and education programs. He has worked to  improve the State's prescription drug monitoring system in order to  curb harmful opioid prescribing and misuse.   Dr. Chen also led efforts to reduce tobacco, marijuana, and alcohol  use among youth. In 2013, he and I worked to secure a $10 million grant  from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,  SAMHSA, to expand substance abuse efforts in Vermont among young adults  at risk of developing habits in alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and  illicit drug use. Since his efforts, the conversation regarding youth  substance abuse, especially on marijuana, has become a major public  health discussion in the Vermont Statehouse and beyond. He also worked  to expand nutrition education in schools and to increase awareness  surrounding the importance of vaccines. For instance, 2 years ago,  after the outbreak of Ebola, Dr. Chen worked with Vermont's top health  facilities to strengthen defenses against the disease, while educating  patients on the importance of disease prevention. He also led efforts  to increase vaccinations for children in efforts to prevent the spread  of disease at school.   Dr. Chen's dedication to public health promotion did not stop at the  State level. In 2009, Dr. Chen testified before the Senate Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on Vermont's experience with  healthcare reform and the creation of Vermont Health Connect. In 2014,  he became chair of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's  Food Safety and Modernization Act Surveillance Working Group where he  continues to strengthen foodborne illness surveillance systems across  the country. He has also long served on the board of the CDC's Office  of Infectious Disease, and he currently chairs the Prevention Committee  of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.   Vermont's national role in promoting the health and well-being of  patients has made strides under the leadership of Dr. Chen. Vermonters  are sorry to  [[Page S1886]]  see him go, but I know we can expect many more years of outstanding  leadership from him. In fact, he and his wife have just been accepted  to the Peace Corps, where they look forward to training physicians in  Africa. I wish them both the very best in this exciting work, and I  once again thank Dr. Chen for his incredible contributions to our State  and beyond.                            ____________________
