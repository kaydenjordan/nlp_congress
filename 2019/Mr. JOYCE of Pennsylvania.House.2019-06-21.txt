 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to advocate  for the brave men and women who defend our country.   Recently, I visited Normandy, France, for the 75th anniversary of D- day. While overseas, I met numerous men and women who were critical in  the defeat of fascism during World War II, and they all gave me a very  simple and direct message: Go home and take care of those who have  served our Nation proudly.   The conversations that I had with the heroes from Normandy have  inspired me this week to cosponsor numerous legislative events. These  will positively affect our veterans.   Congress needs to pass the Agricultural Apprenticeship Act, to allow  veterans to receive the training that they need to enhance their  employment opportunities.   We need to pass the Get Veterans a Doctor Now Act, which allows the  VA to hire top talent so that our veterans can get the best quality of  healthcare.   And we need to pass the Veterans Right to Expediency Act, so that the  veterans who have sustained injuries in the field of battle cannot be  boxed out of filing disability claims.   Madam Speaker, it is time that we take up these measures. Our  veterans have given everything for us.                            ____________________
