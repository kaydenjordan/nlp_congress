 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this past February, the Senate  Judiciary Committee agreed 20 to 2 to pass the Open App Markets Act.  This is a piece of legislation I put together with Senator Blumenthal  to stop tech giants from stifling competition in the app store  marketplace.   Through their control of the app stores on consumer devices as well  as the device operating systems themselves, Apple and Google have  become the gatekeepers of information. They do this by physically  locking down the devices they control, making it near impossible to  access competing content.   Apple fully prevents consumers from accessing third-party apps and  app stores on their mobile devices. Google allows more access to  outside apps but makes the process so difficult that they might as well  lock down their devices the way Apple is locking down the iPhone.   These companies claim that these restrictions make your devices more  secure, but they don't apply the same policies to their laptops and  other similar consumer devices; it is only on the iPhone and on the  Android. Why would that be? Now, I don't know for sure, but I do know  this: By locking down their mobile devices, Apple and Google can force  app developers to abide by their terms no matter how harsh those terms  may be.   Recently, Daniel Eck, who is the founder and CEO of Spotify, said:  ``Over and over again, Apple gives itself every advantage while at the  same time stifling innovation and hurting consumers.'' Elon Musk, now  the CEO of Twitter, has criticized the 30-percent ``tax'' that Apple  and Google take from developers.   What is more, app creators can't go to consumers themselves to offer  them a better deal because that kind of contact is forbidden by Apple  and Google in their terms of service. Think about it. You can't even  reach out to the people who have your app because Apple and Google  forbid you, the developer, from contacting the consumer who is using  your app.   Consider the positions startup developers are placed in. Imagine  trying to get your business off the ground in a market where two major  players control access to your potential customers. There is no other  market, and you can't negotiate with them, so you are forced to play by  the rules the gatekeepers are forcing on you. Under those rules, the  gatekeepers control your access to your customers. They use your  confidential business information against you and block you from using  the features on your customers' device to give them a better  experience.   I heard just this story from a Tennessean named Karen Thomas, who is  the CEO of Agrin Health in Nashville. Listen to the way she describes  how Apple held her company's app hostage. I am quoting her story.         They demanded changes that would eliminate Agrin's paid       functions in its web app and stopped Karen from updating her       mobile app--which was free--until she began charging       consumers through Apple's in-app payment system. This, again,       would let Apple take a 30% cut of every subscription Agrin       received.    That is the ``Apple tax'' in action.   Karen said:   [[Page S6954]]              Our app and our mission was set to die at the hands of       Apple unless our infant company came up with hundreds of       thousands of dollars to reconfigure our service delivery       while losing 30% of associated revenue--and we are not alone.    It doesn't matter if you are a startup or an established company:  When it comes to the digital economy, you depend on Apple and Google to  stay alive because they control your access to your customers. They are  the gatekeepers of your information.   Now, the Open App Markets Act made it out of committee and almost  unanimously received that vote--as I said, 20 to 2. Republicans and  Democrats agree that this is not the way a healthy marketplace should  be working. That is why we got that near-unanimous vote.   This bill needs a vote because it will set the fair, clear, and  enforceable rules needed to protect the competition. It will force Big  Tech to allow third-party apps and app stores on their devices. App  store owners won't be able to lock developers into in-app payment  arrangements anymore, which opens the door to competitive pricing.  Developers will also be able to keep their confidential business  information private. Imagine having to share your information--somebody  else controls it--and they use your business information to compete  against you. Most importantly, the developers will be able to  communicate with their customers, which for any business owner is key  to creating a strong product or service.   I think it has become clear that the American people know how much  Big Tech is controlling their lives, but they are no longer content to  sit by and let these companies consolidate power, especially at the  expense of freedom and basic human rights.    Over the past few weeks, we have watched the Chinese people revolt  against Xi Jinping's ``zero-COVID'' lockdowns. Much of the coverage has  come to us via apps we have downloaded on our phone. But for the  protesters in China, their use of tech is a double-edged sword.   We know the Chinese Communist Party is using apps and other forms of  technology to identify and surveil and ultimately punish the protesters  in China. People are being tracked via their virtual private networks  and through apps like Signal and Telegram.   For activists with iPhones, their options are now even more limited.  Before the protests boiled over, Apple made the unforgivable choice to  disable the AirDrop feature in China only. That is right--the only  place on the face of the Earth that Apple decided to disable AirDrop  was in China, just prior to the protests.   This feature was an activist's best friend because it allowed one  person to share files with an entire local network with no way for the  government to come in and monitor what they were sending. It was a game  changer, and Apple decided to flip the switch.   When reporters asked Apple's CEO Tim Cook last week if he supported  the protesters in China, he refused to answer. Now, I agree, this is  incomprehensible--until you remember that China is Apple's largest  market outside of the United States, and it is a major source for  Apple's supply chain. In fact, both Apple and Google have a long  history of giving authoritarian governments everything that they ask  for. Last fall, both companies acted on Moscow's orders and removed an  app designed to coordinate protest voting in the Russian elections.   My colleagues may remember the scandal that was the 2022 Beijing  Winter Olympic's app. The Chinese Communist Party forced all the  athletes and coaches and spectators to use this app. They didn't have a  choice. Both Apple and Google listed it on their phones even though  they knew the CCP was using it to spy on their customers.   This isn't mere gatekeeping; this is picking winners and losers in an  environment where the losers could end up dead because of the decisions  these companies are making.   When I first started working on this bill with Senator Blumenthal, I  received letters from several human rights organizations thanking me  for paying attention to how these companies were using their power. We  know that Apple has plans to move some of their production out of  China, so perhaps some day, the Chinese Communist Party will have less  of a stranglehold on free communication around the world. But I would  remind my colleagues that moving the chess pieces of production, while  vitally important, does not fully address the problem we are trying to  solve with the Open App Markets Act. Think of everything that happened  before Apple decided to speed up this transition. We don't have time to  put this bill on a shelf while China and Big Tech work out their  differences.   The digital marketplace is no longer a novelty; it is an essential  service that billions of people rely on. In 2020, U.S. consumers spent  nearly $33 billion in mobile app stores and downloaded more than 13.4  billion apps. Two companies exclusively dictate the terms of that  market. They have certainly made it clear that their power comes first,  their profits are more important, and the customers are at the end of  the list. They are last on the list of concerns.   Every day, I hear from Tennesseans who have realized just how little  control they have over their mobile device. They live half of their  lives on their device, and they are no longer comfortable letting Apple  and Google dictate the terms of their interactions with the rest of the  world.   We shouldn't be comfortable with allowing that to continue. I would  encourage my colleagues to join with Senator Blumenthal and with me and  support this legislation. Let's get it passed and to the President's  desk.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
