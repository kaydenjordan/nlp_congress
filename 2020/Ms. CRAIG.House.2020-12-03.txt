 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because COVID-19 is threatening  the American Dream across Main Streets throughout Minnesota and this  Nation. Small business relief is needed now more than ever.   Unfortunately, the support we have provided is poised to become a  significant tax burden for some business owners due to a misguided  interpretation by the Treasury Department. We cannot allow struggling  businesses to be taxed on the aid we have provided to them as a  lifeline.   Fortunately, there is a solution in place to rectify this mistake. In  May, I joined Representatives Lizzie Fletcher and   Andy Kim to  introduce H.R. 6574, the Protecting the Paycheck Protection Program  Act, which would ensure that PPP loan recipients whose loans are  forgiven are not required to treat the loan proceeds as taxable income.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in defending our  Nation's small businesses by supporting this commonsense legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 8211, the 504 Modernization and Small Manufacturing Enhancement  Act of 2020.   I would like to thank the ranking member for being an original  cosponsor of this bill; the chairwoman, for her leadership, and to her  staff for helping me and my constituents throughout the 116th Congress.   Our small businesses are suffering. Every day we see a new wave of  businesses closing their doors. Unemployment numbers are rising, and  our economy is suffering.   I hear from constituents daily that their businesses are on their  very last leg, and without action to support them, they will soon be  forced to close. These are not simply businesses. These are  livelihoods, family traditions, and priceless contributions to our  communities.   It is our job, as Members of Congress, to support these businesses,  ensure they survive these troubling times, and provide them with  multiple avenues to succeed.   In addition to relief, we need to pass legislation that provides  businesses in various industries opportunities for growth and access to  capital. One way we can do this is to build upon the Small Business  Administration's successful 504 loan program that promotes economic  development, job creation, and retention and expansion of small  businesses.   The 504 loan program is designed by local certified development  companies, or CDCs, delivered by those companies, which are private,  nonprofit corporations whose entire purpose is to promote economic  development within their communities.   The program backs long-term, fixed-rate loans to support investment  in major fixed assets through a three-part partnership with a local  lender.   One year ago, in the Subcommittee on Investigation, Oversight, and  Regulation hearing, CDC lenders spoke about their experiences with this  loan program and the many issues they navigated, we saw areas for  improvement.   One was the lengthy and complex loan closing process which caused  third-party lenders to walk away, along with various outdated rules and  guidelines hindering the financing of projects.   In order for small businesses to take advantage of these programs, we  must listen to this feedback and alter our programs accordingly. That  is why I introduced H.R. 8211.   This bill would make an array of improvements to the 504 program,  making it more accessible to small businesses and ultimately driving  economic development and growth.   In a time of economic crisis and unemployment, we must continue to  invest in our small businesses, specifically small manufacturers, in  order to promote economic development and the creation and retention of  good-paying jobs. We must do everything we can  [[Page H6076]]  to support small manufacturers and ensure that the SBA programs  available to them are operating as effectively and efficiently as  possible.   In addition, H.R. 8199, the 504 Credit Risk Management Improvement  Act of 2020, which is also under floor consideration later today, would  further clarify provisions in the 504 program, enhancing its  accessibility and effectiveness.   Mr. Speaker, small businesses are the heart of this economy, and with  the improvements from H.R. 8211 and H.R. 8199, more small businesses  will be able to grow and ultimately contribute to the economic  landscape of not only their communities but this country.   I urge all of my colleagues to support these bills before us today.
