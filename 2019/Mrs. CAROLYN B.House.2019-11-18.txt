 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for leading and for yielding me the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5084, and I thank my  good friend and colleague, Congressman Meeks, for his tremendous  leadership on this bill. We have been working together on it for a long  time, and I am proud to be an original cosponsor.   I also thank Chairwoman Waters for her longtime leadership on these  issues and for working with me and Mr. Meeks on this bill.   The bill is very simple, but the goal is extremely important:  increasing diversity in corporate leadership.   One of the key pieces of this, I believe, is getting more women and  minorities in corporate leadership positions. Leaders set the tone, and  they set the priorities.   I asked the GAO to study this issue in 2015. They found that women  were badly underrepresented on corporate boards. They also found that,  if the current trends continue, it would take more than 40 years for  women to reach parity with men on corporate boards. Clearly, something  needs to change.   Let's be clear. Increasing diversity in corporate leadership is not  just a social issue; it is good business, too. Study after study has  shown that companies with greater gender, racial, and ethnic diversity  on their boards perform better financially.   This bill would help investors accomplish this by requiring public  companies to report the gender, racial, and ethnic composition of their  boards in their annual reports.   The bill would also establish a diversity advisory group at the SEC,  which would study strategies to increase gender, racial, and ethnic  diversity on corporate boards, because the truth is that making  meaningful progress on corporate diversity is going to require a range  of different policies in addition to the improved disclosures in this  bill.                                time  1730    I want to be sure to thank Ranking Member McHenry and my good friend  and colleague Ann Wagner for their strong support. Their leadership on  the other side of the aisle has been instrumental in getting bipartisan  support for this very important bill that has wide support across the  community.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding and for his leadership on this issue and so many  others.   I want to thank Mr. McAdams for all of his work on this crucial  issue. I also want to thank Ranking Member Huizenga, who has been a  leader on this issue for a long time. And I want to thank the  chairwoman and the ranking member for getting this bipartisan deal  done.   Proper enforcement of the securities laws helps maintain investor  confidence in our markets. Investors need to know that if a bad actor  is caught, and the SEC proves that the bad actor committed fraud, then  the investors will get their money back.   Unfortunately, the 2017 Supreme Court decision in Kokesh versus SEC  significantly damaged the SEC's ability to return funds to harmed  investors, by holding that SEC claims for disgorgement of ill-gotten  profits are subject to a 5-year statute of limitations. This means that  for long-running frauds like Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme, the SEC  would not be able to claw back all of the bad actor's profits.   The Kokesh decision has already cost investors about $900 million in  disgorgement of illegal profits according to the SEC.   Mr. McAdams' bill would fix this issue and would lengthen the statute  of limitations from 5 years to 14 years. This is only fair. So I  strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill that my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle support, which will claw back bad actor's money and  put money back in investors' pockets.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentlewoman for yielding and for her leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4634, which would  reauthorize the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, or TRIA, for 7 years.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Waters and Ranking Member McHenry for  working together to reach a compromise on this critically important  bill that can get broad bipartisan support. I also thank my colleagues,  Congressmen Clay and Cleaver, for holding field hearings and for their  tremendous support.   This issue is deeply personal to me because I represent New York  City, and I remember all too well the terrorist attack of 9/11. After  that terrible attack, the market for terrorism insurance completely  shut down. Without terrorism insurance, all construction stopped, and  thousands of jobs were lost. We could not insure anything.   In response, Congress came together in a bipartisan way and passed  the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, which provides a government backstop  for terrorism insurance. The goal of TRIA was to make terrorism  insurance both available and affordable. That is exactly what has  happened because of this bill, and all of this has come at no cost, not  one cost whatsoever, to our taxpayers.   This bill would reauthorize TRIA for 7 years without any changes to  the underlying program. I am pleased that there is broad agreement that  the program doesn't need any additional changes.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter with a listing of over  300 major business leaders from every State in our country that are  supporting this important legislation.                                                 September 17, 2019.        To the Members of the United States Congress: The       undersigned organizations, representing a wide variety of       business interests, urge Congress to work swiftly to pass a       long-term reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act       (TRIA) which is currently set to expire at the end of 2020.        The tragic terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001,       fundamentally changed the landscape for insuring against the       risk of terrorism in the United States. Struck with an       inability to model frequency, location, and the potentially       devastating scale of modern terrorism, insurers were forced       to pull out of the marketplace, and in the months following       the attacks, the inability of insurance policyholders to       secure terrorism risk insurance contributed to a paralysis in       the economy, especially in the construction, travel and       tourism, and real estate finance sectors.        Since its initial enactment in 2002, TRIA has served as a       vital public-private risk sharing mechanism, ensuring that       private terrorism risk insurance coverage remains available       to commercial businesses, educational institutions and non-      profit organizations at virtually no cost to the taxpayer.       According to a 2019 Marsh study, the education, media,       financial institutions, real estate, hospitality and gaming,       and health care sectors had the highest `take-up' rates among       the 17 industry segments surveyed--all above 70%. TRIA       fosters certainty in the marketplace and allows all of these       interconnected elements of the economy to continue to move       forward.        In 2018, the Treasury Department reported that ``the       Program has made terrorism risk insurance available and       affordable in the United States, and the market for terrorism       risk insurance has been relatively stable for the past       decade.'' Absent TRIA, there is not sufficient insurance and       reinsurance capital available to provide comprehensive       terrorism coverage to U.S. insurance buyers.        To this end, the undersigned organizations urge Congress to       promptly enact a ``clean'' long-term extension of this vital       program. Previous reforms to the program have minimized       taxpayer exposure making further reforms unnecessary. In       fact, the key ``dials'' are already effectively indexed to       premium growth at both the company and industry level, and       the federal share will continue to decrease in future years       even if Congress makes no changes to the program beyond a       simple change of the expiration date.        Making changes to the TRIA mechanism to increase insurer       retentions could affect the ability of many insurers,       particularly smaller and mid-sized companies, to write risks       or markets altogether, which ultimately impacts the ability       of policyholders to secure adequate coverage. Maintaining a       workable federal terrorism insurance mechanism is vital for       our nation's economic security, and without adequate       coverage, our ability to mitigate further economic fallout in       the event of an attack would be greatly impaired. There is no       homeland security without economic security.        The American business community remembers all too well the       twelve-day lapse in the program in early 2015 and the       disruption that lapse played in a variety of markets. We urge       Congress to help provide much needed certainty by passing a       long-term reauthorization of this important program without       delay.            Sincerely,        A.I.M.
