 Mr. President, Ken Burns told me last year that his 8- part, 16-hour ``Country Music'' film, which concludes on PBS this week,  could be more popular than his Civil War film. After watching the first  episodes, I suspect he might be right. His new film plumbs the depths  of the American soul, using the one tool--music--that is the most  likely to touch the largest number of us.   As a U.S. Senator from Tennessee, I will confess my bias. The first 2  hours of ``Country Music'' a week ago Sunday were about the recordings  of hillbilly music in 1927 at the birthplace of country music in  Bristol, where the Tennessee-Virginia State line runs down the middle  of Main Street. Two years ago, the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Kaine,  and I, played a little concert--I on the keyboard and he on the  harmonica--at the end of that Main Street, at a fiddler's festival that  they had. The rest of the Ken Burns episode winds through a community  called Boogertown in Eastern Tennessee, in the Smoky Mountains, where  Dolly Parton was born, to the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville and to Beale  Street in Memphis.    We like to say that the whole world sings with Tennessee, but country  music is more than Tennessee music. It is more than Appalachian music.  It is more than the music of poor white Americans. It comes from the  heart.   As Burns' and Duncan's storytelling reminds us, every one of us has a  heart. There is no better evidence of this than paying less than $20 to  sit at a table at the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville. There you listen to  three songwriters tell the stories behind their songs and play them for  a small audience who doesn't even whisper during their performances.   I sat at the Bluebird on a Saturday in 2013, listening to a young  songwriter, Jessi Alexander, sing her song, ``I Drive Your Truck.'' One  of her cowriters, Connie Harrington, had heard the story on NPR. It was  the story of Jared Monti, an American soldier killed in Afghanistan  trying to save another soldier. He won a Congressional Medal of Honor  for that. To remember his son, his father, Paul, drives Jared's Dodge  Ram truck because, the father says, ``I am alone, in the truck, with  him.'' When Jessi Alexander finished singing, everyone in the Bluebird  was weeping. I said to the person next to me, ``That has to be the song  of the year,'' and it was.   Last week, I attended the Annual Nashville Songwriter Awards show. I  looked through the program listing all of the previous songs of the  year. In 2012, it was Dolly Parton's farewell song to Porter Wagoner,  ``I Will Always Love You.'' Dolly Parton is a great songwriter too. In  2003, it was ``Three Wooden Crosses.'' In 1972, it was ``Old Dogs,  Children, and Watermelon Wine,'' by Tom T. Hall. Then, in 1969, it was  ``Okie from Muskogee,'' by Merle Haggard. ``Three chords and the  truth'' is how songwriter Harlan Howard defines country music.   Ken Burns has become America's storyteller, a skill much more  difficult than it would seem. He tackles the subjects that divide us,  like the Civil War and Vietnam, and he presents them in a form that  allows us to travel through those wrenching experiences, gathering the  information we need to form our own opinions.   One could argue that Ken Burns is our most effective teacher of U.S.  history, a subject woefully undertaught in our schools. The lowest  scores on high school Advanced Placement tests are not in math and  science. They are in American history. So I am glad to know that there  is more of Ken Burns' work to come.   According to a New Yorker article in 2017, during the next decade  Burns plans to produce films about the Mayo Clinic, Muhammad Ali,  Ernest Hemingway, the American Revolution, Lyndon B. Johnson, Barack  Obama, Winston Churchill, the American criminal justice system, and  African-American history from the Civil War to the Great Migration.   Producing these films must cost a lot of money, but, in my view,  every penny that the Public Broadcasting System and private  contributors have spent has been worth it. If I had the money, I would  ask Burns how much time he will spend raising funds to pay for these  next films and I would give him the amount of money that it would take  so that he could spend that time producing an extra three or four more  films before he hangs it up. Since I don't have the money, maybe  someone else will do that.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be printed in the Record an  op-ed that was in the New York Times, ``Country Music Is More Diverse  Than You Think,'' by Ken Burns and Dayton Duncan.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the New York Times, Sept. 13, 2019]                Country Music Is More Diverse Than You Think   Common stereotypes overlook the roles that blacks and women have played                    in shaping a uniquely American genre                      (By Ken Burns and Dayton Duncan)         This spring the rapper Lil Nas X, who is black, released       ``Old Town Road,'' a twang-inflected song that rocketed to       the top of the country music charts--even though Billboard       temporarily removed it from the list, saying it wasn't       sufficiently ``country.''        A few months later, when the Country Music Association       announced that three women--Dolly Parton, Reba McEntire and       Carrie Underwood--would host its annual awards show, some       people criticized the choice as political correctness, as if       ``real'' country music was restricted to good old boys.        Both controversies reflect the stereotypes that chronically       surround country music. They overlook its diverse roots, its       porous boundaries and the central role that women and people       of color have played in its history.        Such narrow views would astonish the two foundational acts       of the genre--Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family--who       contributed to country music's early commercial success in       the 1920s. They knew firsthand that what has made American       music so uniquely American has been its constant mixing of       styles and influences.        It all began when the fiddle, which came from Europe, met       the banjo, which came from Africa--bringing together ballads       and hymns from the British Isles with the syncopations and       sensibilities of enslaved blacks. That mix, that ``rub,''       which occurred principally in the South, set off a chain       reaction that has reverberated in our music ever since.        The earliest country recordings were known as ``hillbilly''       music, just as African-American recordings were categorized       as ``race'' music. The names echoed a prevailing prejudice       that each genre (and its artists and its fans) was somehow       beneath consideration from society's upper rungs--and that       each one was unrelated to the other.        In truth, as the two of us learned during the eight years       we spent exploring the music and its history, they were       always intertwined. The music constantly crossed the racial       divide that a segregated nation tried to enforce.  [[Page S5624]]         Before his career took off, Rodgers worked as a water boy       in Mississippi for the mostly black crews laying railroad       track. The men he met, and their music, shaped his own       emerging style--the songs he made popular as an adult were       essentially the blues, to which he added a distinctive yodel.       In 1930, at the height of his popularity, he recorded with       Louis Armstrong, the protean jazz artist.        When A.P. Carter collected songs for the Carter Family, he       brought along Lesley Riddle, a black slide guitar player, to       help him remember the melodies. Riddle also taught the       Carters a hymn from his church, ``When the World's on Fire,''       which they recorded. They then used the same melody for       another song, ``Little Darling, Pal of Mine.'' Years later       Woody Guthrie, a fan of the Carters, borrowed the melody for       his classic ``This Land Is Your Land.'' That one song's       journey encapsulates the real, interconnected story of       American music.        Bill Monroe, the father of bluegrass, was mentored by an       African-American fiddle player. Hank Williams, the great       honky-tonk singer, credited Tee-Tot Payne, a black street       musician in Alabama, for ``all the music training I ever       had.'' Bob Wills created Western swing by adapting jazz's       big-band sound to fiddles and steel guitars.        In Memphis in the 1950s, when rhythm and blues and gospel       and hillbilly music began swirling together in the eddies of       the Mississippi, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and       others pioneered rockabilly, a precursor to rock 'n' roll.        The cross-fertilization went in both directions. Charley       Pride--the first postwar black artist to have a No. 1 country       hit, and the first artist of any color to win the Country       Music Association's male vocalist award two years in a row--      was discovered in a bar in Montana, singing Hank Williams's       ``Lovesick Blues.'' He had grown up listening to the ``Grand       Ole Opry'' show on the radio.        When the rhythm and blues star Ray Charles was given       creative control of an album for the first time, he chose to       record a selection of country songs. ``You take country       music, you take black music,'' Charles said, and ``you got       the same goddamn thing exactly.'' The album was a sales       sensation.        ``There's a truth in the music,'' the jazz musician and       composer Wynton Marsalis told us, that ``the musicians       accepted at a time when the culture did not accept. And it's       too bad that we, as a culture, have not been able to address       that truth. The art tells more of the tale of us coming       together.''        Likewise, the history of country music is filled with       strong and talented women in ways the common stereotype seems       (or chooses) to overlook. From Patsy Montana to Patsy Cline,       Kitty Wells to Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris to Rosanne Cash       to Reba McEntire, women have created some of country music's       most enduring art.        In 1926, A.P. Carter and his wife, Sara, had been turned       down by a record label on the theory that a woman singing       lead could never be popular. Instead, the Carters added       Sara's cousin Maybelle to the group and went on to make       history, centered on Sara's remarkable voice and Maybelle's       innovative guitar playing, ``the Carter scratch,'' which has       influenced generations of guitarists.        Jimmie Rodgers relied on his sister-in-law, Elsie       McWilliams, as the writer of more than a third of his songs.       (He couldn't read musical notations, so she came to his       recording sessions to teach her new compositions to him in       person.)        In 1966, the same year that the National Organization for       Women was founded and the phrase ``women's liberation'' was       first used, Loretta Lynn wrote and recorded ``Don't Come Home       A Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind),'' a statement that       dealt with spousal abuse and alcoholism and a woman's right       to her own body, with a bluntness no other musical genre       dared make at the time. Her label later held back her song       ``The Pill'' because it seemed too controversial; when it was       released, some stations refused to play it--until her fans       made it a Top-5 country hit and crossed it over to the pop       charts.        ``If you write the truth and you're writing about your       life,'' Ms. Lynn told us, ``it's going to be country.''        At its best, country music has never been confined to one       simple category or convenient stereotype. It sprang from many       roots and then sprouted many new branches through the 20th       century, creating a complicated chorus of American voices       joining together to tell a complicated American story, one       song at a time.        Country deals with the most basic, universal human emotions       and experiences--love and loss, hardship and dreams, failure       and the hope of redemption--and turns them into songs. The       songwriter Harlan Howard once defined country music as       ``three chords and the truth.'' Three chords imply       simplicity. But the truth part is always much more complex.       And more profound.    I yield the floor.
