 Mr. President, reserving the right to object.    My staff and I have been in close contact with the  Department of Defense regarding Ms. Harris's nomination. The Department  of Defense is aware of my concerns with the nominee and also aware of  the very simple request that I have made to the Department in  connection with her nomination. For these reasons, I object.    Mr. President, the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v.  Hodges is the law of the land. A single line from a single concurring  opinion does not make the case for legislation that seriously threatens  religious liberty.   The Respect for Marriage Act is unnecessary. States are not denying  recognition of same-sex marriages, and there is no serious risk of  anyone losing recognition. There is not a single piece of legislation  that I am aware of moving through the Congress or any State legislature  to do the same.   But the Supreme Court majority explicitly stated in its Dobbs ruling  earlier this year that the Dobbs decision had no bearing on the  recognition of same-sex marriage. The proponents of this bill falsely  claim that same-sex marriage is under attack because Justice Thomas  suggested in a concurring opinion in Dobbs that the Supreme Court  should take a closer look at all of its substantive due process  jurisprudence; not necessarily to strike down those rulings, but often  to consider whether they should be premised on a different  constitutional hook. The majority opinion is what mattered, and it is  the one that the majority of the Supreme Court supports.   Now proponents of this bill pretend that the legislation would simply  codify the status quo. I take exception to that because I don't think  that is true. But even before we get to that issue, I think it is  important for us to think about what codifying Obergefell on its own  terms could mean and why it is that we ought to look at steps to  protect religious freedom in light of Obergefell and in light of  anything that purports to codify Obergefell.   I remember when the Obergefell case was being argued before the  Supreme Court of the United States in 2015. Solicitor General Don  Verrilli, in representing the U.S. Government--with then the Obama  administration in power--was arguing before the Court, and Justice  Alito, my former boss, interjected with a question.   He asked Solicitor General Verrilli, if the Supreme Court of the  United States recognized a constitutional right to same-sex marriage  throughout the United States, whether that, when read with other  precedent--read in context with other Federal civil rights protections,  along with prior Supreme Court rulings--might not result in the risk of  some nonprofits, including some schools and universities, being  threatened with the loss of their tax-exempt status.   Solicitor General Verrilli responded immediately and unambiguously.  He said: Yes, Justice Alito. That is going to be a problem.   He reiterated it three times that that would be a problem and that it  would be something that would have to be addressed.   What he was acknowledging was that there was a real risk dealing with  Obergefell itself in that, unless we take steps to protect religious  colleges, religious universities, and other religious nonprofits, some  of those might be threatened with the loss of their tax-exempt status,  based solely on their religious beliefs about marriage--about what a  marriage is and what it is not.   Many in the immediate wake of Obergefell came right out, and  purporting to offer comfort to religious Americans and religious  institutions in America, many came forward and said: Oh, this risk  isn't going to materialize.   As I recall it, President Obama, at the time, said: Look, I am not  going to force any church to perform a same-sex marriage contrary to  its religious teachings.   That isn't how this happens. That is not how this risk materializes.  That isn't the risk. It never really was the risk. The risk is, rather,  whether religious Americans, whether acting individually or as a group,  will be retaliated against--denied some privilege or status or access  under Federal law to which they would otherwise have access--based  solely on a religious- or a moral conscience-based belief about the  definition of marriage.   So that risk exists independent of this legislation. It has been  enhanced by the Obergefell ruling, and it would be materially enhanced  if this legislation were to pass without corresponding, necessary,  statutory protections for religious freedom.   Indeed, Cardinal Timothy Dolan of the United States Conference of  Catholic Bishops warns of this very thing.   He warns as follows:         This bill's harms would be far-reaching. In any conflict       with same-sex civil marriage and the rights that flow from       it, it will be said that Congress took pains to codify       Obergefell, but not to protect the freedoms of speech and       religion that Obergefell harms, making them second-class       rights.    In other words, this bill only makes things worse. This bill takes  the preexisting risks presented by Obergefell itself and enhances them,  expands them, especially because, by protecting one set of interests-- those identified in Obergefell, in the decision itself--but doing  nothing to address the corresponding enhanced risks we are presenting  for religious freedoms, it makes for a very, very significant concern.   He continues:         The bill will be a new arrow in the quiver of those who       wish to deny religious organizations' liberty to freely       exercise their religious duties, strip them of their tax       exemptions, or exclude them from full participation in the       public arena.    So this bill--this bill that has been brought before us--will, unless  modified as necessary, result in three significant problems.   First, the bill will label people of faith with differing views on  marriage, influenced by their religious beliefs and moral convictions,  as bigots.   Second, the bill's new private right of action will subject religious  Americans to a torrent of litigation--even more than they face now.  Doing so will further erode their constitutional right to freely live  according to their religious beliefs. This is, after all, what happens  any time we allow for the free exercise of religion to be chilled by  such action.  [[Page S6767]]    Third, the bill will put in jeopardy the work and existence of  religiously minded social agencies, educational institutions, and other  nonprofits as their tax-exempt status will be threatened.   Our country was founded on the principle that government should not  interfere with the ability of people of faith or of people of no faith  at all to practice their religion and to live by the tenets of their  own faith in their daily lives.   Of course, this can and should be done without interfering with the  right of other people to live their lives. That is what we expect. In  fact, every time we as Americans seek to protect freedoms, liberty,  whether through the adoption of the First Amendment or the adoption of  the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, for example, or  anywhere else, we seek to do it in a way that doesn't create a zero-sum  game by enhancing the rights of some while diminishing the rights of  others. That is not who we are. That is not how we roll. That is not  how our constitutional framework was ever intended to function. It is  antithetical to who we aim to be.   This bill elevates the rights of one group and does so at the expense  of another, and it does so needlessly as there is a way to accommodate  both interests, but that way, unfortunately, isn't pursued by the  authors of this bill.   Many, including some on the left, want to label people who disagree  with them on marriage as bigots and force them, in this instance,  through endless litigation and threats, to comply with the beliefs of  the left and renounce their genuine, sincere religious beliefs.   Proponents of this bill claim that the substitute amendment, which we  saw for the first time just a few days ago, somehow fixes all of the  concerns raised by those of us who want to protect religious liberty.  They are wrong. They couldn't be more wrong. They are sadly, sadly, and  severely mistaken. The amendment's narrow protections for people of  faith apply to only limited circumstances--for example, to the  solemnization and celebration of marriages. That protection and a few  others are severely anemic when viewed against the backdrop of the  threat to religious freedom presented by this bill.   Indeed, these changes brought about by the most recent amendment do  nothing to prohibit the already existing, already mounting threat of  government discrimination against individuals and organizations that  hold traditional views regarding marriage--a risk that is materially  enhanced by this legislation and all that will flow from it.   For example, Catholic Charities and other religious adoption agencies  could be shut out of foster care and adoption ministries due to  discriminatory government policies--policies that discriminate against  them specifically because of their religious beliefs. The bill will  only exacerbate what is already occurring in Illinois, Massachusetts,  California, and the District of Columbia, potentially making this a  nationwide trend.   The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' work with the  Department of Health and Human Services in providing foster care to  unaccompanied alien children and to unaccompanied refugee minors will  be even more at risk than it is right now.   The legislation itself will put religiously affiliated schools and  faith-based organizations and others who hold traditional views of  marriage at even more risk of being compelled to hire or retain  employees whose conduct contradicts their religious beliefs. Wedding  vendors will potentially be subject, because of this legislation, to  increased lawsuits, harassment, and the destruction of their  livelihoods based on their religious beliefs and their desire to live  their lives according to their beliefs. This includes small- and  family-owned businesses, including religious businesses like kosher  caterers.   Nonprofits face the potential revocation of their tax-exempt status  based on their religious beliefs. At a time when we have added 87,000  new IRS agents, we shouldn't give them any additional encouragement to  abuse that power in a way that threatens the beliefs and institutions  that are so important to so many Americans and that form the bedrock of  some of our most important institutions.   The bill's proponents claim that they want to protect religious  liberty and that their most recent amendment does that, but they refuse  to adopt my amendment or anything like it that would prohibit the  Federal Government from discriminating against people or organizations  that have traditional views on marriage based on sincerely held  religious beliefs and moral convictions.    In many instances, they claim that the most recent amendment, in  fact, does that--or they at least suggest that. The language of the  most recent amendment even reads as if it might be going in that  direction, but a closer inspection reveals that, alas, it does not. It  does no such thing.   By suggesting that it doesn't do anything to alter or revoke tax- exempt status or any other status under Federal law--that the bill  itself doesn't do that--it ignores the fact that this bill sets in  motion, keeps in motion, and accelerates existing threats to religious  freedom and to their revocation of tax-exempt status for broad  categories of nonprofits based on religious beliefs.   It is disingenuous to suggest that this halts government from doing  what I am warning of here. This amendment does not do that, which begs  the question: Why? Why wouldn't they accept it?   Importantly, my proposed amendment places no restrictions on  individuals or even on State or local governments. It simply prohibits  the Federal Government from discriminating against individuals or  organizations that have sincerely held religious beliefs or moral  concerns that marriage is and should be a relationship between a man  and a woman. That is all.   What I don't understand is why my colleagues claim to want to protect  religious liberty and uphold the First Amendment and, in fact, claim  that their amendment essentially does that while simultaneously  opposing my amendment so vigorously. I think we all know the answer to  that question.   The bill pays lip service to protecting religious liberty, but it  does not even begin to address the most serious, egregious, and likely  threats to religious liberty presented by this bill. Those with  differing views and beliefs can exist in the United States without  threatening the constitutionally protected rights of one group--rights  upon which our country was founded--to score political points.   You see, that is the beauty of America. Our Founding Fathers believed  strongly in the principle that all religious beliefs should be  protected, not just those favored by those in charge of government. It  is yet another reason why, when we approach rights through legislation  in the U.S. Senate and as Americans more broadly--when we protect  rights--we know that we have a duty, an obligation, and an ability to  secure those rights that we are trying to secure in a way that doesn't  undermine the rights of others.   The fact that one group of Americans might have more political  support for a particular right and in protecting that right doesn't  make it OK within our system, within our culture, within our traditions  to undermine the rights of others. That is exactly what we are facing  here.   The good news is we can fix it. We can fix it. It is easy to amend  this thing in a way that doesn't have to be this way. I have yet to  hear any of my Democratic or Republican colleagues who supported the  bill say that they want the Federal Government to be able to go out and  indiscriminately threaten the revocation of tax-exempt status in order  to punish religious beliefs with which they disagree.   I have yet to hear a single Republican or a single Democrat in the  House or in the Senate or anywhere else in this town say--I have yet to  hear any of them say--yes, that is what we want to do.   In fact, everyone who has addressed the issue has said: No, that is  not what we want to do. Most of those on this bill have said: No, we  have already taken care of that with this amendment. If that is really  true, let's just adopt my amendment.   And if you don't want to do it in that form, if you want to write out  another version of the same thing, something that does the same thing,  that is fine too. But they shouldn't be able to punish religious  belief. That is all I want,  [[Page S6768]]  a protection saying the Federal Government may not punish any  individual or entity based on a religious or moral conviction-based  belief about marriage. That is not too much to ask.   If you ask any American citizen whether that was reasonable, shoot,  if you ask any Member of this body in public whether that is fair and  reasonable, I think they would have to say yes because it is.   When legislation goes through this body and through this Congress in  the proper way, we have a better chance of ironing out these details,  of making sure that we are not expanding the zone of protected rights  and interests of some at the expense of others. We do that pretty well.   Mr. President, you and I serve together on the Judiciary Committee.  That is the committee of jurisdiction for legislation like this. This  legislation should have gone through the Judiciary Committee, and yet  we have not held a single hearing on it. We have not marked up this  bill in Judiciary. We haven't independently voted on this bill in the  Judiciary Committee.   In fact, it hasn't been through any committee process in the Senate  that I am aware of. If it had, you know the kind of work we would have  run it through, the kind of work we would have put into it, and the  kind of carefully crafted language we could have produced as a result  of it.   I am confident we could have and would have and definitely should  have worked this out in committee had we had the opportunity to do so.   This legislation bypassed committees. Sometimes that happens. I  understand that it happens from time to time. It is usually a very  unfortunate thing when it does. But when it does, it does not excuse us  from the obligation to try to replicate that process by at least making  sure that we are not harming other people outside the immediate zone of  intended protected beneficiaries of the legislation in question. That  is all I am asking for here, and it isn't too much to ask.   States and the Federal Government can, and surely will, continue to  recognize the validity of same-sex marriages, and they can do so  without trampling on the First Amendment rights of those who believe in  traditional marriage.   That is what it means to live in a pluralistic society. That is what  it means to live in a society where we respect each other's  differences, we allow each other to be who we are, live as we choose to  live. That can't be done unless we allow each other to believe as we  believe and not retaliate against others simply because they believe  differently than we do.   Americans of good faith can continue to live by their own religion  and daily life by living as they do and doing so without posing any  threat to those who disagree with them. I am confident of that. But  this bill does not strike that balance. It purports to do so, and it  fails.   It labels people of good faith as bigots and subjects them to endless  harassing litigation and discrimination and threats by that same  government that was founded to protect their religious liberty.   Let's do this the right way, not the wrong way. We need to protect  religious freedom. This bill doesn't do that. It places it in grave  jeopardy. Let's fix the problem.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
