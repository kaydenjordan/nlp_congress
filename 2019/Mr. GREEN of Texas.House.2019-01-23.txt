 Madam Speaker, I rise once again as a proud  American. I love my country. I love what it stands for, in terms of its  great ideals. And, Madam Speaker, as a proud American, I rise today to  address the question of hostage taking.   One of the principles that we employ in international diplomacy--and  I am being a little bit euphemistic by saying ``international  diplomacy''--is that of not negotiating with hostage takers.   If you take one of our planes, highjack one of our planes, and you  demand a ransom, we will not negotiate with you. Grab an American off  the streets in some distant place, and we will not negotiate with you.   It doesn't matter that you start out at $50 million and then reduce  your desire to have a ransom to $10 million, maybe. We don't negotiate  with you. You are a hostage taker.   The United States of America, the greatest and richest country in the  world, which can pay the price, refuses to negotiate with hostage  takers.   Madam Speaker, this is bigger than the President. This is about  whether or not we will allow any President to take hostages and demand  a ransom that must be paid or else the hostages will continue to  suffer. This is about whether we will allow any President to do this-- not just a Republican President, any President.   It is un-American to take persons hostage within this country and  demand a ransom when we wouldn't allow it on the international stage.   I am a person who decided that it was appropriate to meet with the  hostages, and I did. I met with the hostages who work with the IRS. I  heard their clarion call for help, their appeal for some understanding.   When I met with them, it became very clear to me that there is pain  beyond the pain of not having the check to pay the bills.   Some of these persons literally indicated that they were having some  mental concerns that would have to be addressed because they played by  the rules. They have come to work; they have done their jobs; and now  they find themselves in this most tenuous position of being denied the  wages they have earned.                                time  1115    There is something wrong when a President will hold people hostage to  the extent that they have mental issues as a result of the hostage  taking.   One of the things called to my attention was that they don't believe  that this all ends with them the moment they are allowed to go back to  work and receive the wages that they have earned. They believe that  they may have to have some additional counseling to help them through  and to better cope with the experience that they never contemplated  they would have as a result of being employed by the United States of  America, the richest country in the world.   This is bigger than this President. It is about him, but it is bigger  than him. It is about whether or not we will allow hostage taking  within the country and yield to it, or will we demand that we do what  we continue to say is our bedrock principle when it comes to  negotiating with hostages on the international stage, and that is, you  release our people; you let them go.   Mr. President, let our people go. You have become a modern-day  pharaoh. You are holding people hostage, Mr. President. Don't you see  what you are doing to the fiber and fabric of this country? Don't you  see how you are ripping it apart? You are a modern-day pharaoh. Let our  people go.
