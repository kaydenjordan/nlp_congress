 Madam Speaker, the rent is too damn high. The rent is too  damn high. We have people across the country struggling to keep a roof  over their heads.   We are the wealthiest Nation in the history of the world, outside of  ancient African civilizations, yet we cannot provide housing for every  single person in our country.   We have CEOs making record profits. We have corporations making  record profits. We have corporate landlords suppressing and oppressing  and evicting tenants without just cause while continuing to raise the  rent.   We call on President Biden to take executive action on this issue. We  do not have a healthy democracy or a healthy society unless we take  care of our tenants and our working-class people who are working 40,  50, 60, 70 hours a week just to survive.                            ____________________
