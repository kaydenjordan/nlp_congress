 Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8665, the National Archives  and Records Administration Modernization Act, offered by Mr. Khanna and  myself.   The National Archives and Records Administration plays an important  role in securing our Nation's history for future generations.   This simple legislation updates Archive's authoring law to ensure  that the Archivist is not referred to solely as a male.   This makes sense, since our current Acting Archivist, Debra Wall, is  a female.   To date, there have been three female Archivists, yet there are  several instances where title 44 still refers to the Archivist as a  man.   Although the code, as written, does not preclude a woman from serving  as the Archivist, these changes would update outdated language in title  44 and modernize our Federal code to make it more uniform across the  board.   Replacing this outdated language in our Federal code is the very  least we can do to acknowledge the valuable contributions of thousands  who have worked at NARA since its creation in 1934--and the thousands  more who will work there in the years to come.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan,  straightforward correction of the law, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, as we wind down the 117th Congress, I am glad to be  here supporting final passage of the Quantum Computer Cybersecurity  Preparedness Act, a bipartisan bill the House sent to the Senate just  this past July.   After the Senate made technical, perfecting edits, we are here today  to consider sending H.R. 7535 to the President.   As an emerging technology, quantum computing holds great promise and  potential peril for our Nation.   While the technology continues to rapidly develop with potential to  improve computing capabilities for American research in the economy,  there is a clear risk that foreign adversaries, like China, will be  using this technology for malicious purposes.   One such risk is that our foreign adversaries may use the first  quantum computers to unlock data that has already been stolen from U.S.  Federal agencies.   Current data encryption methods are nearly impossible to decrypt with  today's computing capabilities.   However, mature quantum computing systems could unlock our most  sensitive information. This is a clear national security threat.   The Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act will require a  government-wide strategy to better secure valuable government data.   While the Federal Government already has initiatives underway to  address these emerging threats--such as a recent Presidential national  security directive--H.R. 7535 makes this a clear congressional  priority.   Advancing a strategic approach to evaluating quantum computing risks  to Federal IT and network cybersecurity is important given the  significant potential risk to our public-sector data.   Madam Speaker, I thank my House Oversight Committee colleagues,  Representatives Ro Khanna and Nancy  [[Page H9661]]  Mace, for their work on this important bill.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1445     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  South Carolina (Ms. Mace).    Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bipartisan bill that addresses an emerging national security issue, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5349, which honors J.I.  Washington III, a significant figure within the South Carolina  Democratic Party.   J.I. advocated for more equitable participation and leadership for  Black American politicians. He also had a crucial role in moving Black  Americans into the political arena in Orangeburg County, and many in  the county and State viewed Mr. Washington as the glue that held the  different factions of the party together.   Outside of politics, he was known for his poultry farm and his work  on the South Carolina State University board of trustees and in the  NAACP.   Notedly, J.I. served our Nation in World War II's European theater as  part of the 351st Field Artillery Battalion.   I encourage my colleagues to support this bill honoring a community  leader and World War II veteran.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5949, which honors  Judge James Perez, the first Latino judge appointed in Orange County,  California.   Judge Perez grew up in Orange County, where he attended Santa Ana  High School and worked in the tomato fields until he was drafted into  World War II.   During the war, he served in the Army Air Corps as a technical  sergeant.   After the war, he enrolled at the University of Southern California  and received a bachelor's degree and a law degree.   In December 1966, he was appointed judge of the Orange County  Municipal Court. Nine years later, he was elevated to the Orange County  Superior Court. He remained on the superior court for 11 years until  1987.   Judge Perez dedicated his life to the law and his community, and I  encourage my colleagues to support this bill honoring a local public  servant and a World War II veteran.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H9663]]    Madam Speaker, this bill simply changes the address of the Marilyn  Monroe Post Office in Van Nuys, California, which Congress named in  2019.   Marilyn Monroe grew up in Van Nuys and attended Van Nuys High School.  The neighborhood held a special place in her heart. She said it was a  source of joy and allowed her to escape from her turbulent childhood,  so it is appropriate that a post office there be named for her.   I encourage my colleagues to support this bill honoring an American  icon, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, Esteban E. Torres was a Korean war veteran,  antipoverty activist, and Member of the U.S. House of Representatives  from 1983 to 1999. He was introduced to politics after becoming  involved in the local branch of the United Auto Workers union.   When he was elected to the U.S. House, he was assigned to the  Committee on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs and the Committee on  Small Business. He also later served on the Committee on  Appropriations.   As a former autoworker with ties to the Hispanic community, Mr.  Torres is credited with having served a key role in crafting the North  American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. He passed away on  January 25, 2022.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7873, which honors all  servicemembers and veterans who reside in the District of Columbia.   There are approximately 31,000 veterans who currently live in the  District and more than 200,000 D.C. residents who have served in the  military since World War I.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill  honoring American patriots from the Nation's capital city, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7988, which honors  Corporal Hunter Lopez.   Corporal Lopez was born in Palm Springs, California, to parents who  were employed by the Riverside County Sheriff. He grew up to join the  U.S. Marine Corps.   His first 3 years were spent with the Fleet Antiterrorism Security  Team Company A, 5th Platoon. His fourth and final year in the Marines  was spent with the 2nd Battalion 1st Marine Division, Golf Company, 1st  Platoon, 3rd Squad.   It was just last year, while serving with the 2nd Battalion, that  Corporal Lopez was involved in Operation Allies Refuge, which involved  the evacuation of 120,000 of our fellow Americans, allies, and Afghans  from Afghanistan.  [[Page H9665]]    On August 26, 2021, Corporal Lopez was stationed at the Kabul  airport, where crowds were growing increasingly desperate. Corporal  Lopez spotted two young girls trapped under the weight of a fleeing  crowd, about to be crushed. He helped pull the two girls to safety  right as a bomb exploded at Abbey Gate.   Corporal Lopez and 12 other servicemembers were tragically killed  that day.   I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this bill honoring a  war hero who made the ultimate sacrifice for those abroad who yearned  to enjoy the freedoms and liberty we all cherish in America.   Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7519, which honors Dr.  Ezra S. Parke, the former postmaster of Bloomfield Township, Michigan.   Dr. Parke was an early resident of Bloomfield Township, moving there  in 1822, and serving as the area's first local postmaster, from 1824  until 1836. Simultaneously, he served as Bloomfield Township's first  clerk, a position he maintained until 1844.   It is fitting that a post office be named for Dr. Parke, a dedicated  local public servant. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.   Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 8026, which honors  Charles W. Lindberg, a highly decorated Marine Corps corporal who  fought in World War II and raised the first American flag over Iwo  Jima.   Most people are unaware that there were actually two American flags  raised at Iwo Jima. The famous Associated Press photo that we are all  familiar with, the picture that is depicted at the Marine Corps War  Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery, was actually the second flag  raised.   Corporal Lindberg raised the first flag alongside five other marines  on the morning of February 23, 1945, after fighting their way up Mount  Suribachi.   Corporal Lindberg spent decades explaining that his patrol, not the  patrol shown in the famous Associated Press photo, raised the American  flag over the island.   After World War II, Corporal Lindberg was awarded a Purple Heart.   Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I encourage my  colleagues to support this bill honoring an American war hero. I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8226, which honors  Officer Leo Pavlak, who was killed during a robbery in South St. Paul,  Minnesota, in 1933.   He had been escorting two employees for Stockyards National Bank as  they went to the train station to pick up  [[Page H9667]]  their payroll, which had been shipped from a Minneapolis bank. After  collecting the payroll, they were ambushed, and Officer Pavlak was shot  in the face and died instantly.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill  honoring a local law enforcement hero, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 9074, which honors  Richard Milanovich, Chairman of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla  Indians.   The son of a Native American mother and Serbian father, Chairman  Milanovich grew up in Palm Springs, California, living in a shack and  receiving food stamps.   From 1960 to 1963, Milanovich served as an infantryman in the United  States Army and later returned to join the Agua Caliente Band of  Cahuilla Indians Tribal Council in 1978 in Riverside County,  California.   In 1984, he was elected chairman of the Band, a position he would  serve in for the next 30 years. Because of his leadership and vision,  the Agua Caliente Band became the most prosperous group of Native  Americans in the United States and made significant contributions to  the Palm Springs area.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8622, which honors  Chief Rudolph ``Rudy'' Banuelos, a true public servant.   He served in the United States Coast Guard during World War II and  then joined the U.S. Postal Service for 20 years in the community of  King City, California.   He was the local postmaster for 9 years where this post office will  be named after him. Chief Banuelos passed away on November 1, 2021. I  encourage my colleagues to support this bill honoring a local public  servant and World War II veteran.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill  honoring a local public servant and World War II veteran.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7082, which honors  Jesus Antonio Collazos, a former U.S. Postal Service employee.   Mr. Collazos immigrated to the United States from Colombia in 1978  with hopes of making the American Dream a reality.   Jesus had a 25-year career with the Postal Service, most of which was  spent at a post office near D.C. in Arlington, Virginia.   He made a good impression early on in his career and was offered a  leadership position. However, he ultimately turned down the position,  continuing his work as a letter carrier because he preferred to spend  his time outdoors and foster relationships with the people on his  delivery route.   It is fitting that the post office on George Mason Drive in  Arlington, Virginia, be renamed for Mr. Collazos.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill  honoring a dedicated local public servant, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7638, which names a  Florida post office for Marine Corporal Ronald R. Payne, Jr.   Upon graduating from Mulberry High School in Florida in 1999,  Corporal Payne joined the Marine Corps and  [[Page H9670]]  completed boot camp at Parris Island, South Carolina.   He was deployed to Iraq where his unit, the 2nd Light Armored  Reconnaissance Battalion, engaged in the initial invasion of the Iraq  war.   Corporal Payne returned home from Iraq and only a few months later  was deployed to Afghanistan to help with the country's elections. His  mission changed when Afghanistan's elections were postponed.   On May 7, 2004, he ran a mission with his reconnaissance team to  confirm that an al-Qaida operative was meeting in a village with  Taliban lieutenants.   Corporal Payne was shot in the chest when he exposed himself to enemy  fire to lay down suppressive fire, allowing a critically wounded fellow  team member to drag himself behind cover.   Minutes later, Payne was mortally wounded by shrapnel from a rocket- propelled grenade.   For his selfless acts of heroism, after his death, Payne was awarded  the Bronze Star medal with combat distinguishing device, in addition to  a Purple Heart.   Corporal Payne's bravery, concern for his fellow marines, and desire  to serve America embody the ethos of the Marine Corps. I encourage my  colleagues to support this bill honoring an American war hero who made  the ultimate sacrifice.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  South Carolina (Ms. Mace).    Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill honoring a dedicated local public servant, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6630 which honors  Private First Class Jang Ho Kim.   Born in South Korea, he immigrated to the U.S. with his family in  1990, lived in New York, and later in Orange County, California.   He enlisted in the U.S. Army in June 2005, completing basic training  and advanced individual training at Fort Benning, Georgia. He was  deployed to Baghdad, though he never told his family of his deployment  because he did not want to worry them.   Sadly, he was killed when a roadside bomb exploded near his vehicle.  For his service and sacrifice, after his passing, he received a Bronze  Star and a Purple Heart. PFC Jang Ho Kim was an American patriot who  paid the ultimate sacrifice in service to our Nation.   Madam Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer).
