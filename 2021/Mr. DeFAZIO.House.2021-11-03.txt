 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4679) to designate the Federal building located at 1200 New  Jersey Avenue Southeast in Washington, DC, as the ``Norman Yoshio  Mineta Federal Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4679         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DESIGNATION.         The Federal building located at 1200 New Jersey Avenue       Southeast in Washington, DC, shall be known and designated as       the ``Norman Yoshio Mineta Federal Building''.       SEC. 2. REFERENCES.         Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper,       or other record of the United States to the Federal building       referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to       the ``Norman Yoshio Mineta Federal Building''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H6146]]  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4679.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 4679 names the Department of Transportation  headquarters building in Washington, D.C., after our former colleague  Norm Mineta. This recognition is long overdue.   Secretary Norm Mineta is a great American patriot. He, along with his  family, suffered the grave injustice of being forcibly relocated and  interned during World War II. But he was not bitter toward his country  or his government. Instead, he spent his career serving his country by  participating in and improving government.   For almost 30 years, Norm represented San Jose on the city council,  then as mayor, and then from 1975 to 1995 as a Member of Congress. Norm  served on the Committee on Transportation and Public Works throughout  his two decades in Congress, and we served together for 7 years. Norm  chaired the Subcommittee on Aviation, the Subcommittee on Surface  Transportation, and finally the full committee.   Norm was a primary author of the Intermodal Surface Transportation  Efficiency Act of 1991, ISTEA, which, as President George H.W. Bush  said during the signing ceremony, was ``the most important  transportation bill since President Eisenhower started the interstate  system 35 years ago.''   Norm was also a cofounder of the Congressional Asian Pacific American  Caucus and served as its first chair.   Norm's skills and accomplishments have been widely recognized by both  sides of the aisle. Norm was President Bill Clinton's Secretary of  Commerce and President George W. Bush's Secretary of Transportation,  where he was the longest-serving Secretary of Transportation in U.S.  history, January 2001 until July 2006. Norm was the first person of  Asian-Pacific descent to serve as Secretary of Commerce or Secretary of  Transportation, and he was the first DOT Secretary to have served in a  previous Cabinet position.   Following the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001, Secretary Mineta  worked closely with the then-chair of the Subcommittee on Aviation, Mr.  Mica, and myself as ranking member to create the Transportation  Security Administration.   Prior to that time, the security at airports was always provided by  the lowest bidder. In fact, one of the companies was owned by previous  felons. We professionalized aviation security in the TSA. That agency  was 65,000 employees, the largest mobilization of a new Federal agency  since World War II.   For his contributions to this institution, to our government, and to  the field of transportation, Secretary Mineta deserves this  recognition.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1400     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I recommend this legislation to my  colleagues for this long-overdue honor for the longest-serving  Secretary of Transportation and the only one who ever served previously  as Secretary in another part of the administration.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4660) to designate the Federal Building and United States  Courthouse located at 1125 Chapline Street in Wheeling, West Virginia,  as the ``Frederick P. Stamp, Jr. Federal Building and United States  Courthouse''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4660         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DESIGNATION.         The Federal building and United States courthouse located       at 1125 Chapline Street in Wheeling, West Virginia, shall be       known and designated as the ``Frederick P. Stamp, Jr. Federal       building and United States Courthouse''.       SEC. 2. REFERENCES.         Any reference in law, map, regulation, document, paper, or       other record of the United States to the Federal Building and       United States Courthouse referred to in section 1 shall be       deemed to be a reference to the ``Frederick P. Stamp, Jr.       Federal Building and United States Courthouse''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4660.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4660 designates the Federal Building located at  1125 Chapline Street in Wheeling, West Virginia as the Frederick P.  Stamp, Jr. Federal Building and Courthouse. This legislation was  introduced by Congressman   David McKinley of West Virginia.  Congressman McKinley has long sought this designation to honor Judge  Stamp's career and legacy.   Frederick P. Stamp Jr. was born in Wheeling, West Virginia, received  a bachelor of arts degree from Washington and Lee University, and a law  degree from the University of Virginia. He was a private in the United  States Army from 1959 to 1960, and a first lieutenant in the Army  Reserves from 1960 to 1967. After 30 years in private practice in  Wheeling, from 1960 to 1990, he was nominated by President George H.W.  Bush to a seat on the United States District Court for the Northern  District of West Virginia, where he served as chief judge from 1994 to  2001.   Judge Stamp's service to his community, his State, our Nation, and  the judicial system is widely respected. I strongly support H.R. 4660,  as an overdue recognition of his service, and I urge my colleagues to  join me.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is a long overdue honor for Judge Stamp. And as the  gentleman from West Virginia said, he would never have sought this  honor himself, but it is being done by Congress in recognition of his  great service to our Nation and the judiciary.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support the legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
