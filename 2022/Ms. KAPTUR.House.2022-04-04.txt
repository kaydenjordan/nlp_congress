 Madam Speaker, the unspeakable carnage Vladimir Putin and  his war machine are unleashing across Ukraine is barbaric.   The images from Bucha are almost too horrific to comprehend. Men,  women, children, and the elderly are bound and thrown on the streets as  if they were garbage. The world is dealing with a tyrant who counts  victory with body bags.   Every nation must arm Ukraine with the weaponry and defenses it  needs. Every nation must end their imports of Russian coal, oil, and  gas. Every nation must twist the screws of sanctions tighter and  tighter until Putin and his enablers choke.   The hundreds of thousands of American and Allied servicemembers who  gave their lives across European nations in the 20th century did not do  so only for the cause of liberty to go unaided in the modern era.   The free world must immediately rise up together. Fend off evil. End  the bloodshed. Lead Ukraine to restore its liberty.                            ____________________
