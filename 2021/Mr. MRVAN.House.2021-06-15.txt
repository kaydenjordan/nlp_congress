 Madam Speaker, it is with great admiration and pride that  I rise to honor Sister Peg Spindler for her lifetime of service and  dedication to the Sojourner Truth House in Gary, Indiana.   After more than 24 years of service, Sister Peg will be retiring on  July 1 as the executive director of the women's shelter.   Sister Peg found her calling to sisterhood at a young age while  growing up in Cedar Lake, Indiana. In November 1997, Sister Peg, along  with the support of the Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ, opened the  doors to the Sojourner Truth House, which serves the true vulnerable  populations, the homeless, the underserved, and the at-risk women and  their children, with the goal of providing them the necessary tools and  resources to improve their quality of life.   After retiring, Sister Peg plans to visit Catholic parishes  throughout the country to advocate on best practices, to reduce carbon  dioxide emissions, and to combat the harmful effects of climate change  on the most vulnerable.   Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in honoring  Sister Peg Spindler for her lifetime of leadership and tireless  dedication to the most vulnerable of populations in her community.                            ____________________
