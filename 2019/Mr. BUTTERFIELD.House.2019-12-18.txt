 Madam Speaker, I rise on this solemn occasion as we,  the House of Representatives, exercise the power given to us by the  United States Constitution.   The original Constitution was flawed in some respects, but with  respect to Presidential misconduct, it was unmistakable. The Framers  knew that Presidents could be corrupt or abusive with their power so  impeachment was written into our organic law.   Since taking office nearly 3 years ago, President Trump has  consistently and intentionally divided this country. He has  consistently encouraged foreign actors to interfere in our elections.  He has thumbed his nose, Madam Speaker, at the legislative branch.   Enough is enough. We must protect our Constitution, our democracy. I  will vote today to prefer serious charges against President Trump and  deliver the charges to the Senate for trial, a place where President  Trump can defend himself and attempt, if he chooses, to convince the  Senate and the American people that his conduct does not violate the  Constitution.
