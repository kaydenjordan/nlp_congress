 Mr. President, before I begin, I would like to ask  unanimous consent to put into the Congressional Record an open letter  to the Russian leadership from the Russian Congress of Intellectuals,  who state:         Our position is simple: Russia does not need a war with       Ukraine and the West. Such a war is devoid of legitimacy and       has no moral basis.    This is a very brave statement made by Russian intellectuals.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:             [From the New York Review of Books, Feb. 4, 2022]                  An Open Letter to the Russian Leadership                      russian congress of intellectuals         Our position is simple: Russia does not need a war with       Ukraine and the West. Such a war is devoid of legitimacy and       has no moral basis.        There is an ever-increasing flow of alarming news about a       possible Russian invasion of Ukraine. Reports are emerging       about stepped-up recruitment of mercenaries within Russia and       the transfer of fuel and military equipment to Ukraine's       Donetsk and Luhansk regions. In response, Ukraine is arming       itself and NA TO is sending additional forces into Eastern       Europe. The tension is not abating, but rather mounting.        Russian citizens are becoming de facto hostages of a       reckless adventurism that has come to typify Russia's foreign       policy. Not only must Russians live with the uncertainty of       whether a large-scale war will begin, but they are also       experiencing a sharp rise in prices and a devaluation of       their currency. Is this the sort of policy Russians need? Do       they want war--and are they ready to bear the brunt of it?       Have they authorized the authorities to play with their lives       in this way?        But no one asks Russian citizens for their opinion. There       is no public debate. State television presents only a single       viewpoint--that of the warmongers. Direct military threats,       aggression and hatred are aimed at Ukraine, the US, and the       West. But the most dangerous thing is that the war is being       depicted not only as permissible, but as inevitable. This is       an attempt to deceive the population, to impose upon them the       idea of waging a crusade against the West, rather than       investing in the country's development and improving living       standards. The cost of the conflict is never discussed, but       the price--the huge, bloody price--will be paid by the common       Russian people.        We, responsible citizens and patriots of Russia, appeal to       Russia's political leadership. We openly and publicly call       out the Party of War that has been formed within the       government.        We represent the viewpoint of those in Russian society who       reject war, who consider unlawful the use of military threats       and the deployment of a blackmailing style in foreign policy.        We reject war, whereas you, the Party of War, consider it       acceptable. We stand for peace and prosperity for all Russian       citizens, whereas you put our lives on the line for the sake       of political games. You deceive and manipulate people,       whereas we tell them the truth. You do not speak in the name       of the Russian population--we do. For decades, the Russian       people, who lost millions of lives in past wars, have lived       by the saying: ``if only there were no war.'' Have you       forgotten this?        Our position is quite simple. Russia does not need a war       with Ukraine and the West. No one is threatening us, no one       is attacking us. Policies based on the idea of such a war are       immoral and irresponsible and must not be conducted in the       name of the Russian people. Such a war is devoid of       legitimacy and has no moral basis. Russian diplomacy should       take no other position than a categorical rejection of such a       war.        Not only does such a war not reflect Russia's interests,       but it also threatens the country's very existence. The       senseless actions of the country's political leadership,       which is pushing us in this direction, will inevitably lead       to a mass anti-war movement in Russia. Each of us will       naturally play a part in it.        We will do everything in our power to prevent this war, and       if it begins, to stop it.

Mr. President, as I speak today Europe, for the first  time in almost 80 years, is faced with the threat of a major invasion.  A large nation threatens a smaller, less powerful neighbor, surrounding  it on three sides with well over 100,000 troops as well as tanks and  artillery.   My colleagues, as we have painfully learned, wars have unintended  consequences. They rarely turn out the way the planners and experts  tell us they will. Just ask the officials who provided rosy scenarios  for the wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq, only to be proven  horribly wrong. Just ask the mothers of the soldiers who were killed or  wounded in action during those wars. Just ask the families of the  millions of civilians who became collateral damage in those wars.   The war in Vietnam cost us 59,000 American deaths and many others who  came home wounded in body and spirit. The casualties in Vietnam, Laos,  and Cambodia are almost incalculable, but they were in the millions. In  Afghanistan, what began as a response to the horrific attack against us  on 9-11-2001 eventually became a 20-year war, costing us $2 trillion  and over 3,500 Americans who were killed, not to mention tens of  thousands of Afghan civilians.   George W. Bush claimed in 2003 that the United States had ``put the  Taliban out of business forever.'' Well, not quite the case--the  Taliban is in power today.   The war in Iraq, which was sold to the American people by stroking  fear of a mushroom cloud from Iraq's nonexistent weapons of mass  destruction, led to the deaths of some 4,500 U.S. troops and the  wounding--physical and emotional--of tens of thousands of others. It  led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, the displacement  of over 5 million people, and regional destabilization whose  consequences the world continues to grapple with today.   In other words, despite all of the rosy scenarios we heard for those  foreign policy and military interventions, it turned out that the  experts were wrong and millions of innocent people paid the price. That  is why we must do everything possible to find a diplomatic resolution  to prevent what would be an enormously destructive war in Ukraine.   No one knows exactly what the human costs of such a war would be.  There are estimates, however, that come from our own military and  intelligence community that there could be over 50,000 civilian  casualties in Ukraine, not to mention millions of refugees flooding  neighboring countries as they flee what could be the worst European  conflict since World War II.   In addition, of course, there would be many thousands of deaths  within the Ukrainian and Russian militaries. There is also the  possibility that this regional war could escalate to other parts of  Europe, a continent with many nuclear weapons, and what might happen  then is beyond imagination.   But that is not all. The sanctions against Russia that would be  imposed as a consequence of its actions and Russia's threatened  response to those sanctions could result in massive economic upheaval  with impacts on energy and gas and oil prices in our country, banking,  food supplies, and the day-to-day needs of ordinary people throughout  the entire world. It is likely that Russians will not be the only  people suffering from sanctions. They would be felt throughout Europe.  They would be felt right here in the United States and likely around  the world.   And by the way--and we haven't discussed this terribly much--at a  time when the scientific community tells us that climate change is an  existential threat to the planet, any hope of international cooperation  to address global climate change and to address future pandemics would  likely suffer a major setback.   It should be absolutely clear about who is most responsible for the  looming crisis, and that is Russian President Vladimir Putin. Having  already seized parts of Ukraine in 2014, Putin now threatens to  take over the entire country and destroy Ukrainian democracy. There  should be no disagreement that that behavior is totally unacceptable.  In my view, we must unequivocally support the sovereignty of Ukraine  and make clear that the international community will impose severe  consequences on Putin and his fellow oligarchs if he does not change  course.    With that said, I am extremely concerned when I hear the familiar  drumbeats in Washington--the bellicose rhetoric that gets amplified  before every war--demanding that we must show strength, demanding that  we must get tough, demanding that we must not engage in appeasement.   A simplistic refusal to recognize the complex roots of the tensions  in the region undermines the ability of negotiators to reach a peaceful  resolution.   Now, I know it is not very popular or politically correct, I guess,  in Washington, to consider the perspectives of our adversaries, but I  think it is important that we do so if we are going to formulate good  policy. I think it is helpful to consider this. One of the  precipitating factors of this crisis--one, not the only one--at least  from Russia's perspective, is the prospect of an enhanced security  relationship between Ukraine and the United States and Western Europe,  including what Russia sees as the threat of Ukraine joining the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, a military alliance originally  created in 1949 to confront the Soviet Union.   It is good to know some history.   When Ukraine became independent after the Soviet Union collapsed in  1991, Russian leaders made clear their concerns about the prospect of  former Soviet states becoming part of NATO and positioning hostile  military forces along Russia's border. U.S. officials recognized these  concerns as legitimate at the time. One of those officials was William  Perry, who served as Defense Secretary under President Bill Clinton. In  a 2017 interview, Perry said:         In the last few years, most of the blame can be pointed at       the actions that Putin has taken. But in the early years I       have to say that the United States deserves much of the       blame.    Further:         Our first action that really set us off in a bad direction       was when NATO started to expand, bringing in eastern European       nations, some of them bordering Russia.    That is former Secretary of State William Perry.   Another U.S. official who acknowledged these concerns is former U.S.  Diplomat Bill Burns, who is now head of the CIA in the Biden  administration. In his memoir, Burns quotes a memo he wrote while  serving as counselor for political affairs at the U.S. Embassy in  Moscow in 1995.         Hostility to early NATO expansion is almost universally       felt across the domestic political spectrum here.    Over 10 years later, in 2008, Burns wrote in a memo to Secretary of  State Condoleezza Rice:         Ukrainian entry into NATO is the brightest of all redlines       for the Russian elite (not just Putin). In more than two and       a half years of conversations with key Russian players . . .       I have yet to find anyone who views Ukraine in NATO as       anything other than a direct challenge to Russian interests.    So, again, these concerns were not just invented yesterday by Putin  out of thin air. Clearly, invasion by Russia is not an answer, neither  is intransigence by NATO. It is important to recognize, for example,  that Finland, one of the most developed and democratic countries in the  world, borders Russia and has chosen not to be a member of NATO. Sweden  and Austria are other  [[Page S634]]  examples of prosperous and democratic countries that have made the same  choice.   Vladimir Putin may be a liar and a demagogue, but it is hypocritical  for the United States to insist that we as a nation do not accept the  principle of spheres of influence. For the last 200 years, our country  has operated under the Monroe Doctrine, embracing the principle that as  the dominant power in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has the  right--according to the United States--to intervene against any country  that might threaten our alleged interests. That is U.S. policy. And  under this doctrine, the United States has undermined and overthrown at  least a dozen countries throughout Latin America, Central America, and  the Caribbean.   As many might recall, in 1962, we came to the brink of nuclear war  with the Soviet Union. Now, why was that? Why did we almost come to the  brink of nuclear war with the Soviet Union?   Well, we did that in response to the placement of Soviet missiles in  Cuba, 90 miles from our shore, and the Kennedy administration saw that  as an unacceptable threat to national security. We said it is  unacceptable for a hostile country to have a significant military  presence 90 miles away from our shore.   Let us be clear. The Monroe Doctrine is not ancient history. As  recently as 2018, Donald Trump's Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson,  called the Monroe Doctrine ``as relevant today as it was the day it was  written.''   In 2019, former Trump National Security Advisor, John Bolton,  declared ``the Monroe Doctrine is alive and well.''   To put it simply, even if Russia were not ruled by a corrupt,  oligarchic, authoritarian leader like Vladimir Putin, Russia, like the  United States, would still have an interest in the security policies of  its neighbors.   I want people to think about this: Does anyone really believe that  the United States would not have something to say, if, for example,  Mexico or Cuba or any country in Central or Latin America were to form  a military alliance with a U.S. adversary?   Do you think that Members of Congress would stand up and say, ``Well,  you know, Mexico is an independent country. They have the right to do  anything they want''? I doubt that very much.   Countries should be free to make their own foreign policy choices,  but making those choices wisely requires a serious consideration of the  costs and benefits. The fact is that the United States and Ukraine  entering into a deeper security relationship is likely to have some  very serious costs for both countries.   I believe that we must vigorously support the ongoing diplomatic  efforts of the Biden administration to deescalate this crisis. I  believe we must reaffirm Ukrainian independence and sovereignty and  that we must make clear to Putin and his gang of oligarchs that they  will face major consequences should they continue down their current  path.   My colleagues, we must never forget the horrors that a war in the  region would cause, and we must do everything possible to achieve a  realistic and mutually agreeable resolution, one that is acceptable to  Ukraine, Russia, the United States, and our European allies and that  prevents what could be the worst European war since World War II. That  approach is not weakness; it is not appeasement. Bringing people  together to resolve conflicts without war is strength, and it is the  right thing to do.   I yield the floor.    I appreciate the thoughts of my friend from Illinois.  With much of what he said, I, obviously, agree. My father came from  Poland as a matter of fact.   I think, maybe, the difference of opinion that we have has something  to do with what we don't talk about very often openly but that, I  think, everybody knows exists.   I mentioned--and I think you will not disagree with me--that, over  the last many, many decades, the United States has overthrown  governments throughout Latin America, Central America, and the  Caribbean. There is no denying that we almost went to a nuclear war in  1962 under the Kennedy administration, which felt--and probably  correctly--that Soviet missiles in Cuba, 90 miles away from us, were a  threat to this country and not to be tolerated.   So I would only ask my friend from Illinois to put himself into the  mindset of the Russians in that nobody here--not I, certainly--is ever  talking about reclaiming other countries. You mentioned that, and it is  certainly not anything that I support.   But if the United States has a right to overthrow countries  throughout Latin America to protect our so-called interests and if  there would be an uproar in this Chamber, perhaps from you and me as  well, if Mexico, which is an independent nation, decided to form a  military alliance with China or Russia, and people were to say you  can't do that, should we not put ourselves a little bit in Russia's  position in understanding that if we consider Latin America and Central  America and the Caribbean to be within our sphere of influence and have  the right to intervene, that Russia itself might have some legitimate  concerns about military forces 5 miles from their border? That is the  question I would pose.    No, we would not. But my point is, the Monroe Doctrine  remains in existence today. It is not just history.   You and I can agree that maybe the United States should not have  overthrown governments over the years. The Monroe Doctrine exists  today. Two years ago, the Secretary of State said it is in existence. I  don't know how many people in this Chamber would tell you that it does  not exist today.   I use that example, to my friend from Illinois--if Mexico were to  enter into an alliance with China, would my friend say: Well, Mexico is  an independent country; they have the right to do anything they want.    No, it does.   All that I am saying is, 2 years ago, the Secretary of State of the  United States of America said the Monroe Doctrine is alive and well.   Yes, of course, it is hypothetical. I do not believe that Mexico is  going to enter into an alliance with China. But all I ask is to put  what is going on in Russia into a context and to look at American  policy and history as well. This is a complicated issue, and I think it  is important for us to at least look at the concerns that Russia has.   There is no disagreement that if Putin were to commit the horrible,  horrible blunder of invading Ukraine, count me in as somebody who will  go as far as we can to make sure there are real consequences against  the oligarchs and that policy. But I do think if we are going to reach  a settlement in a very complicated issue, it is important for us to  understand a little bit about Russia's concerns.    The Senator knows I am not for looking the other way.  That is not a fair statement. As I have said many, many times, I am  strongly supportive of major, major, major consequences if Putin  invades Ukraine, and we have got to do everything we can to protect  Ukrainian sovereignty.   All right, I have made my point.
