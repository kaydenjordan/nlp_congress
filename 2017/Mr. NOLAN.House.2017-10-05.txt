 Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, I rise in support  of the Democratic budget alternative and in opposition to the  Republican budget that has been proposed.   It has been often said that gracious living and good politics is all  about gratitude. Paying something forward is how you show your  gratitude.   Quite frankly, the simple truth about this Republican budget is that  it rolls back a century of progress. It sets the stage for the  dismantling of Social Security, which lifted more people out of poverty  than anything, and for Speaker Ryan's plan to turn it over to Wall  Street.   It sets the stage for turning Medicare over to the insurance  industry--Medicare that provided our elderly with insurance and life  opportunities that heretofore had not existed.   This century of progress that this budget rolls back includes clean  air and water. It includes healthy, safe working places and conditions.  It includes an opportunity society that invests in our people.   And guess what? In a little over a century, we doubled life  expectancies. Wow, what a marvelous accomplishment.   We created the best and biggest middle class in the history of the  world. We became a model for the world; jobs with living wages and  healthcare benefits and pension benefits.   This Republican budget proposes to roll back that entire century of  progress. It is nothing about paying it forward. It is nothing about  paying things back. It is about rolling back a century of progress, and  we can not let that happen.   That is what the Democratic budget is really all about, investing in  people, investing in infrastructure, investing in America, and  investing in people's jobs and living wages, and in their benefits.  That is how you show your gratitude, and we have got a lot to be  grateful for.   Let's vote and enact this Democratic budget proposal which invests in  America, which invests in people, which invests in opportunities. That  is what this debate is really all about.
