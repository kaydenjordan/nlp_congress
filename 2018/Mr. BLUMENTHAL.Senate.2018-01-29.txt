 Madam President, today is a proud day but also a  painful one for me. I am proud because I am honored and proud to join  my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Shaheen, and  others on the floor. I was proud to join Connecticut organizations and  advocates this morning in Hartford for a rally that involved Planned  Parenthood of Southern New England, NARAL Pro-Choice Connecticut, the  Women's March of Connecticut, AIDS Connecticut, and the Center for  Medicare Advocacy. These groups are proud and steadfast and have strong  activists who joined me to support a woman's right to determine her  medical future, the right of privacy, and the constitutional right to  be left alone, as one of the Supreme Court Justices once called it.   It was a proud moment for me also because it reminded me of my days  as a law clerk for Justice Harry Blackmun, who was the author of Roe v.  Wade and who taught me the constitutional principle that underlies a  woman's right to determine her own healthcare decisions.   Harry Blackmun was a Republican appointee. He was a Republican before  he became a jurist. But there was nothing partisan for him--and there  should be nothing partisan for us--about this decision. I am tempted to  call this 20-week abortion ban a Republican proposal, but when I think  about the Republicans I know--and especially Justice Harry Blackmun,  whom I revered--there is nothing Republican about this proposal. There  is nothing partisan about a proposal that seeks to interfere in this  fundamental right of privacy. It is an extremist, rightwing proposal  that happens to have been brought here by 46 of our Republican  colleagues--all of them men, except two--who are essentially trying to  tell the women of America what to do with their own bodies, when to  have children or not. That is fundamentally unconstitutional. It flies  in the face of Roe v. Wade and all of its progeny. It is a restriction  that has been struck down when adopted at the State level in at least  two courts, and the others that have adopted similar proposals will be  struck down, in my view, as well.   The consensus of the medical community, the legal community, and  ordinary citizens, particularly women, is that women have reproductive  rights that would be violated, dramatically and directly, by this  proposal. It violates those rights for totally baseless reasons-- policies founded on falsehoods. It is another excuse for rightwing  dogma and ideology, out of touch with America, to seek to put opponents  at a political disadvantage. It is transparently a political ploy.   The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists--the doctors  who are most qualified to present scientific, evidence-based facts-- disagree with the assertions and falsehoods that fetuses can feel pain  at 20 weeks. In fact, the American College of Obstetricians and  Gynecologists wrote--and I am quoting directly from medical experts on  fetal health:         Sound health policy is best based on scientific fact and       evidence-based medicine. The best healthcare is provided free       of governmental interference in the patient-physician       relationship. Personal decision-making by women and their       doctors should not be replaced by political ideology.    Worse than the fabrications behind this bill are the very real  consequences that will come if it is passed. This nationwide abortion  ban would provide virtually no adequate exception when a woman's health  is at risk, when there are fetal anomalies or when there are dangers to  the health and well-being of a mother who is sick; or if her life is  threatened, this bill fails to guarantee that she has access to the  healthcare that she needs. If there is a fetal anomaly and a woman  learns that her child will be born with significant impairments or,  worse yet, a short life filled with pain, it would force her to carry  that child to term. If a woman is advised that her child will not  survive pregnancy at all, the most personal medical decisions of her  life would be usurped by a cruel, heartless, unconscionable,  unconstitutional law. She would be deprived of the right to make those  decisions with her family, her clergy, her doctors.   The American public disagrees strongly with this potential law, as  does the medical community, and individual doctors who have real-life  experiences disagree strongly with it as well. One doctor who practices  in Connecticut told me that for patients who are treated in that office  who choose to get an abortion after 20 weeks, it is oftentimes ``an  agonizing decision, an unexpected one, and too often a lonely one--a  decision that is deeply personal and altering.''   For many women, he told me, medical tests show a devastating issue  with a future child. ``A joyous event becomes a tragic one, as they  learn of a lethal condition, or a syndrome that will lead to a brief  life of suffering.''   I could quote other doctors. I could quote women who have been  through this experience. But without exaggerating, it is one of the  most deeply difficult, personal decisions that women have a right to  make, without the interference of a politician, an insurance  bureaucrat, or anyone else in positions of authority. It is their  decision.   Congress must keep its hands off women's healthcare. To my  colleagues, keep your hands off of women's healthcare. It is their  lives and their well-being and their personal privacy that are at  stake.   I am going to continue to fight this ban, painfully, because its  consequences would be so cruel, but also because it is certainly not  the Republican Party that I know that would advocate for it. It  certainly should not be partisan in any way, and it certainly should  not even be before us in this great Chamber, which has such respect and  such a profound role in our Constitution. To consider violating the  Constitution so dramatically is a disservice to this great body.    I yield the floor.
