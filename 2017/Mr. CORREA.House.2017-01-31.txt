 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  724, which would rescind President Trump's refugee ban in light of  mothers like Ran Chauhan, who arrived in the U.S. 5 years ago and is  going through the naturalization process, but is separated from her  sister and two children who are set to arrive in mid February.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.
