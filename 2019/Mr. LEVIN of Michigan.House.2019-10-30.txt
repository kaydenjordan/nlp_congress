 Mr. Speaker, last week, I experienced one of  the true honors of my time in Congress. I participated in the burial of  Marine Corps Reserve Private First Class Kenneth W. Likens of Mount  Clemens, Michigan.   Private Likens died fighting to protect the freedoms of all of us on  the third day of the Battle of Tarawa Atoll in the Gilbert Islands in  the Pacific theater during World War II.   Incredibly, his remains, which have been missing for 75 years, were  identified in May, thanks to the tireless and underappreciated efforts  of Hero Flight, which refuses to give up the fight to bring democracy's  heroes home.   I was so moved to attend this dignified and solemn ceremony at Great  Lakes National Cemetery in Holly, Michigan, and to meet PFC Likens'  nearest surviving relative, Kenneth Dolan, who was named for his uncle,  the lost soldier.   PFC Likens is lost no more. He now rests in peace where he belongs,  in the land of the free and the home of the brave.                            ____________________
