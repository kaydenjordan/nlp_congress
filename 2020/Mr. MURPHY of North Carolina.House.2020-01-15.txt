 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address  the tragedy of our national debt.   Out-of-control spending is the single greatest nonviolent threat to  our Nation. This year alone, the Federal deficit increase exceeded $1  trillion.   Just to give some perspective, a trillion $1 bills stacked from the  ground would reach 60,000 miles into space. The International Space  Station is only at 200 miles. This stack would reach one-quarter of the  distance to the Moon.  [[Page H275]]    The current debt is at $23 trillion, which amounts to $70,000 per  American. It continues to compound year after year after year without  any relief in sight.   It is estimated that the national debt will rise to 93 percent of GDP  in the next 10 years. That means that for every $100 that this Nation  makes, $93 would have to go toward servicing our debt.   Mr. Speaker, this is a national tragedy. We are bankrupting our  children and our children's children's future. We must stop this  impending disaster. I urge my colleagues and associates to help us  address real solutions.                            ____________________
