 Mr. Speaker, Israel has a right to exist. There are  only two ways to vote on this. Either you vote ``yes'' or you vote  ``no.'' ``No'' means you do not believe Israel should be a country.  ``No'' means you believe a country should be wiped off the face of the  Earth. A ``present'' vote means you do not believe Israel should be a  country. Hanging out in the cloakroom, having a hot dog, or missing the  vote means Israel shouldn't be a country.   This is a moment for people in this body, on a bipartisan basis, to  stand together and say they believe Israel has a right to exist.   Hamas doesn't think Israel has a right to exist. Hezbollah doesn't  think Israel has a right to exist. Iran doesn't think Israel has a  right to exist. People who vote ``no'' or vote ``present'' side with  them. They pick a side with Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran.   I don't want to hear excuses. ``Oh, I didn't like this `whereas'  clause,'' or, ``Oh, there was a period or a comma out of place,'' as if  somehow we always vote on perfect resolutions around here. Again, it is  an opportunity to show the world that we believe Israel has a right to  exist.   We see anti-Semitism in the streets and at rallies. At cease-fire  rallies, which is a foreign policy position, we see people holding  signs that say: ``Gas the Jews,'' ``Kill the Jews,'' and ``Cleanse the  Jews.'' That is not a foreign policy. If it is, it is a foreign policy  of Germany in the early 1940s.   This is a moment for people in this body, some of whom sit in the  rows behind me, to show they believe Israel has a right to exist.   I am for a two-state solution, Mr. Speaker. I think it is important  that the Palestinian people get a state. But rest assured, in that two- state solution, one of those states is going to be Israel.    Mr. Speaker, I conclude with this: Anyone who believes  that Israel doesn't have a right to exist is calling for genocide. We  hear that word thrown around a lot now on  [[Page H5926]]  social media, ``genocide.'' We have a war in the Middle East. We don't  have genocide.   If you believe a country should not exist, the millions of people in  that country should also not exist, which means you are calling for  genocide.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to vote ``yes'' on this resolution.  Israel has a right to exist.
