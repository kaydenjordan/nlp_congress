 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3053, the  Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2018. As a cosponsor of this  legislation, I understand the importance of enacting critical reforms  to our nuclear waste management strategy, reforms that are long  overdue.   Mr. Chairman, I have the great honor of representing Georgia's 12th  Congressional District, which is home to every nuclear reactor in our  State, and we are leading the way in the new nuclear.   At Plant Vogtle, in my district, there are thousands of spent fuel  rods being held in spent fuel pools and dry cask storage containers,  and in the next few years we are going to double the number of nuclear  reactors online at Vogtle.   H.R. 3053 would help pave the way to quickly establish a permanent  geological repository to dispose of the waste that currently sits in  121 communities across America, including those in Georgia-12. This  process has gone on far too long, and now it is time for Congress to  act and pass this commonsense legislation.   I want to thank Subcommittee Chair Shimkus for his work and diligence  on this matter, and I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to join me in voting ``yes'' for this bill.
