 Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight the Care  Corps Demonstration Act, a bill that Congresswoman Michelle Lujan  Grisham and I will be introducing this week.   Every year, millions of seniors and individuals with disabilities  find themselves in need of long-term care and services. However, our  Nation faces a critical shortage of caregivers. To address this growing  problem, I have joined Michelle to introduce the Care Corps  Demonstration Act.   This commonsense and bipartisan bill will create a grant program that  will provide compassionate young men and women an opportunity to gain  valuable experience working with seniors and individuals with  disabilities across our great land.   Care Corps will not only help empower our young adults to meet our  Nation's senior needs, but it will also provide them with essential  educational assistance and give them an opportunity to start or further  their careers as caregivers.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this bill so that  our seniors and those with disabilities receive the care they so  desperately need while empowering our youth to advance their careers.                            ____________________
