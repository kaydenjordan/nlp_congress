 Mr. President, today I rise in remembrance of my dear  friend Brigid McDonough. Many years ago, she agreed to be the treasurer  of my Senate campaign and stayed in that volunteer job for over a  decade. That was a courageous thing to do in this political climate.  But that was the kind of friend Brigid was: loyal and always there. She  wanted to serve the people.   She loved her family. She loved her husband, Reid. I know how hard it  was for Reid and Brigid at the end, and the last few years the two of  them had together were so precious. Brigid loved her extended family of  course. I will always remember being at the Lumberjack Days Parade in  Stillwater, and Brigid would run up and give me a big hug--and her  sister would run up and give me a big hug and then some other McDonough  would. Her affection was contagious.   Since her admission to the Minnesota bar in 1984, her life and career  were rooted in how she could best lift others up. She believed that  government and the law can be used to help people achieve equity and  social justice in a world where playing fields are not often level. She  used her impressive legal acumen to achieve good things on behalf of  many people in our State.   Brigid recognized the power of political and community organizing, of  getting involved. She was inspired by the DFL tradition and the honest  conviction to fight for what is just. If you asked me what politician  she was most inspired by, I would have to say Senator Paul Wellstone.  He was her hero. Campaigning for Paul is how I first met Brigid; She  was a true believer, happily working at a law firm by day, and spending  her free time out there holding up those green signs for Paul.   Providing affordable housing to underserved communities was a major  goal for Brigid, and she approached her volunteer work with the same  focus she had at the law firm. Whether she was representing immigrant  and refugee families through her pro bono work, supporting her alma  mater and community by serving on the Macalester College alumni board  and the Hmong Partnership board, or chairing the St. Paul DFL--that  alone is a career unto itself--Brigid always brought this earnest  conviction to fight for what was good, often on behalf of people who  couldn't always do it for themselves.   Brigid did so much through the valuable guidance she offered to  dozens of local, State, and national political campaigns. She was  especially dedicated to electing women and people of color to public  office, and she was really good at it.   Brigid was kind and generous, loyal to friends and colleagues, and  compassionate, smart, and really funny. She and Reid loved traveling  and both were voracious readers. I always admired her adventurous  spirit and valued hearing her opinions on everything from Minnesota  politics to Bruce Springsteen. Friends considered her a font of wisdom  and ideas, and she always shared recommendations on books, movies, and  music, with warmth and affection.   There are certain people who have a way of seeing and bringing out  the very best in others. Brigid was one of those people.   Let's remember Brigid's fierce love of life. That is what made the  time we spent with her so special. Her friendship and her commitment to  making a difference in the world are true gifts that will continue to  benefit all of us who were lucky enough to know her.                            ____________________
