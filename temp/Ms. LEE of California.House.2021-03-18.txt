 Madam Speaker, first of all, let me say that I  rise in strong support of H.R. 6, the American Dream and Promise Act. I  thank Congresswoman Roybal-Allard, Chairman Nadler, and Chairwoman  Lofgren for advancing this legislation and supporting our Dreamers.   It is time that we protect these young people who have never called  any other country than America home. Dreamers and individuals eligible  for TPS or Deferred Enforcement Departure contribute mightily to their  communities and to our economy. They deserve a pathway to citizenship.   Now, the Dreamers in my State of California and in my Congressional  district have made so many contributions under very scary and difficult  circumstances.   Madam Speaker, yes, they are as American as I am. I ask for an  ``aye'' vote.
