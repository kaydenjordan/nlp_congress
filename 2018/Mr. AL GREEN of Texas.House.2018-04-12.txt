 Mr. Speaker, I am always honored to have this  great privilege of speaking in the House of Representatives. We have a  total of 441 Members of the House, including those delegates, those who  cannot vote, 435 who can, and it is an honor to be one of the 441.   I never want to take for granted this privilege that has been  accorded me by the people of the Ninth Congressional District of Texas,  so I thank them for allowing me to serve, and I am grateful to the  leadership in the House for allowing me the opportunity to speak  tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I am here tonight, I rise, if you will, because I would  like to reference H. Res. 817. This was introduced on April 11, 2018.  This resolution celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act  of 1968. The Civil Rights Act of 1968 contained the Fair Housing Act,  and it is the Fair Housing Act that this resolution actually addresses.   I am proud to say that the Honorable Emanuel Cleaver is the person  that worked with me. In fact, we worked with each other to produce this  resolution. I am proud also to say that this resolution has a total of  54 cosponsors that are officially acknowledged, and then we have two  additional cosponsors that have not been officially placed on the  Record, but they are still cosponsors of this resolution.   This resolution does something that is important. It celebrates and  commemorates, if you will, the passing of the Fair Housing Act. The  Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination. It prohibits it  based upon race, color, national origin, sex, familial status,  disability, religion, and should have other categories added. It should  have sexual orientation. It should have gender identity. So there is  still work to do.   And for those who may not believe that persons are discriminated  based upon gender identity and sexual orientation, those persons who  are fired from their jobs because of their gender identity, fired from  their jobs because of sexual orientation, they have stories to tell,  because they not only know that it happens, they have experienced it.  They have had a firsthand encounter with this type of discrimination.   It also exists in housing. People are discriminated against because  of who they are, because of their sexual orientation, gender identity,  and for the other reasons that we have already codified into law.   So it is my hope that one day I will stand here with a resolution  that will celebrate not only what the law is currently, but also what  the law will be at that time, and, hopefully, it will include other  classes of individuals.   I am also proud to tell you, Mr. Speaker, that this resolution is one  that is subject to have additional cosponsors. I have talked about  original cosponsors, but there are others who will become cosponsors.  The Congressional Black Caucus has a good many members who are  cosponsors of this resolution. I am proud to tell you that we plan to  continue to acquire cosponsors such that, by the end of this month, we  will have many additional cosponsors.   Mr. Speaker, housing is important, because where you live can impact  your health. If you live near landfills and rock crushing companies,  that can have an impact on your health. This is why a good many people  find themselves combating, fighting, in a very political way, the  placement of these types of facilities in their neighborhoods.    There is empirical evidence to show that where you live can impact  your health, where you live can impact your education. If you live in  an area with poor schools, it is likely that you will have a poor  education. There are exceptions, but exceptions don't make the rule.  Exceptions prove the rule.   Where you live can impact your employment. If you live in an area  with high unemployment, you are likely not to have a job. If  unemployment is exceedingly high, as is the case in some places around  the world and in this country too, there are persons who are not likely  to have jobs.   If you live in an area where you are likely to be in poverty, you are  likely not to become wealthy. Your wealth can be related to the area  that you are born in, where you live. There are exceptions, but there  are also persons who don't acquire the opportunity to become an  exception.   Your life expectancy can be impacted by where you live. If you live  in a war  [[Page H3206]]  zone, your life expectancy will be impacted and your personality can be  impacted. If you live in a hostile environment, hostility all around  you, it is likely to impact your personality.   So where you live is important, which is why invidious discrimination  in housing is something that should not be tolerated, and I am proud to  say that there was a struggle that was overcome so that we could have  this Fair Housing Act.                                time  1915    I would like to do this now. I would like to give a bit of history of  the Fair Housing Act that was signed into law in 1968, April 11, 1968.  A little bit of history is important.   If you understand the history, you can understand why I make the  comment that the law, itself, was written in ink, but it was signed, in  a sense, with the blood of the many who died and made sacrifices so  that the bill could become the law. I believe that the history of the  times is important.   It was signed April 11, 1968, as I have indicated, during the  sixties. The sixties were not the best of times for this country. In  the 1960s, on June 11, 1963, President John F. Kennedy proposed a Civil  Rights Act. However, he was not to see it become the law because on,  November 22, 1963, he was assassinated. Upon being assassinated,  President Johnson was sworn in as President on Air Force One that very  same day, November 22, 1963. Then, in July, July 2, 1964, after the  death of President Kennedy, President Johnson signed the Civil Rights  Act of 1964, which outlawed discrimination based on race.   Now, it is important to note that President Kennedy, who was a great  President, highly respected and admired, proposed the Civil Rights Act,  or a civil rights act. He lost his life before he had the opportunity  to see it come to fruition.   But it is also important to note that President Johnson worked  tirelessly to make real the noble American ideal that was called to the  attention of our Nation by President John F. Kennedy. President Johnson  was, if you will, the person in the Senate who knew how to speak  Southern.   He knew how to communicate well with the Southern Senators and the  Members of the House. He knew the rules of the Senate. He knew how  persons had voted in the Senate, and he knew how to leverage the votes  and the rules to get Senators to do things that they might not  ordinarily do.   So when you couple his knowledge of the Senate with the fact that we  had lost a great President, and this great President had proposed this  Civil Rights Act, you can understand how President Johnson, a great  President, was able to get the Civil Rights Act of 1964 passed that  outlawed discrimination based upon race.   In 1967, we had what was called the long, hot summer. There were what  were called riots. I prefer another term. I see what happened as  rebellions. There were people who were suffering. I don't justify what  happened, but I can explain that there were people who were rebelling.   Now, whether you agree with the rebellions or not, they took place.  That was what precipitated what was called the long, hot summer. In  fact, it was such a rebellious time that, on July 28, 1967, the Kerner  Commission was appointed to investigate the causes of these rebellions.   President Johnson appointed this Commission. He wanted to get to the  bottom of what was going on in this country. And on February 29, 1968,  the Commission released its report, which said, in essence, that the  rebellions--they didn't use the term ``rebellions,'' that is my term-- the rebellions were caused by discrimination, that this Nation was  becoming two separate people, if you will, people who were segregated  from each other. This is in a very general sense. That we were becoming  two nations, in a sense, separate and unequal.   This was something that I think President Johnson was impacted by.  But there were many others who were impacted by this.   Dr. Martin Luther King, he was trying to bring this country together.  He was an integrationist. And in trying to bring this country together,  Dr. Martin Luther King went to Memphis. He was trying as best as he  could to achieve some degree of fairness for those who were working as  sanitation workers.   President Johnson announced, on March 31, 1968, that he would not  seek reelection; and then some days later, on April 4, Dr. King, while  in Memphis, was assassinated.   So now we had the death of a great President; we have the death, now,  of the great human rights, civil rights leader, Dr. Martin Luther King,  taking place; and then President Johnson, the same President Johnson  who pushed through the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the same President  Johnson sought to push through the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which  contained the Fair Housing Act. It was within about 1 week of the  demise, the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King that he was able to  sign into law the Civil Rights Act of 1968.   The important aspect of this history is this: that these acts, though  written in blood and signed in ink, were able to be signed because of  the death of great persons, and also many persons who were not so  great. They weren't great in the eyes of history because they were not  documented as having done the things that President Johnson or  President Kennedy or Dr. King accomplished.   But there were other great people, as well, who shed blood and gave  their lives. There were people who were found to have marched, and some  of them were protesting and lost their lives. There were people who  suffered the indignation and humiliation associated with segregation  and the fact that there were those who wanted to maintain the  institution to the extent that Medgar Evers lost his life. They wanted  to maintain the institution to the extent that Schwerner, Goodman, and  Chaney lost their lives.   They wanted to maintain segregation. They wanted the South. They  wanted the country to remain two separate nations, if you will, within  this Nation: one, unfortunately, discriminated against, and another  having all the benefits that this great Nation could offer.   The loss of lives allowed us to achieve an integrated housing system  within this country. The integrated system was just not enough, and  still is not enough, because housing discrimination exists to this very  day. The empirical evidence is there. The truth of the matter is that  we can do more to eliminate the discrimination.   One of the best tools to eliminate discrimination in housing is  testing, where you send out persons of different races, different  ethnicities, and you ask them to acquire housing at a certain location.  Those who are of one race may find that housing is available to them,  but those of another race may find that it is not--at the very same  location, on the very same day.   We have found that testing is one of the best tools to eliminate  discrimination, especially in housing. But I want to announce today  that testing is also a great tool to eliminate discrimination in  lending.   This Civil Rights Act, this Housing Fairness Act, and all of the  tools that we have used to achieve the degree of integration in housing  and fairness in housing that we have achieved, this has been done, in  great part, because of testing. That same tool of testing that helped  us to integrate housing in this country is a tool that we can use to  allow persons to receive fair treatment in lending, fair access to  capital.   The truth is that access to capital in this country makes all the  difference in your life. If you can go into a bank and you are  qualified and you can get a loan to buy a home, that home that you will  buy will impact your life in ways that I have talked about, impact your  life expectancy, impact your education. It can have a positive impact  on your life. It can be the means by which you will move from one  status in life to another. Just living in that neighborhood and buying  that home can be meaningful to you.   We believe that that loan should not be denied a person because of  that person's race, color, creed, national origin, sexual identity,  sexual orientation, familial status, religious status. That person's  loan should not be denied. It should be granted because of your  qualifications.   This is why I am a proponent of testing. This is why I want to see  more testing in banking. This is why I believe that we need additional  laws to protect those who apply for loans, because access to capital  makes a difference in your life. This is why I will  [[Page H3207]]  be introducing, in this Congress, legislation to make it a crime to  discriminate in lending.   People who deny people access to capital are committing an offense.  People who deny people access to capital are impacting their lives. I  want to make sure that people who do this are properly punished for  what they do. If we can pass such a law, I believe it will deter those  who would discriminate against persons because of who they are, and it  would cause them to better understand that every person who is  qualified for a loan ought to acquire that loan.   So I am leaving you with the notion that we are building on what  happened with the Civil Rights Act. We are building on the sacrifices  that have been made by persons such as Dr. Martin Luther King and a  good many others. We are going to build on it.   We are going to introduce legislation that can help all persons  receive not only the house that they merit by virtue of having the  money, but also acquire the capital in lending such that they can  afford the house that they qualify for by way of the loan they will  receive.   I am honored to thank you for the time that I have been accorded, Mr.  Speaker. I am grateful that I have the opportunity to stand here in the  House and make this presentation, and I am grateful to this country for  allowing a person who, at birth, would never have been thought to stand  in this position in the House of Representatives.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 28 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, April 13, 2018, at 9  a.m.                            ____________________
