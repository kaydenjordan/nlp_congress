 Mr. Speaker, named in memory of a hardworking and  honorable man, the RAY BAUM'S Act reauthorizes the Federal  Communications Commission for the first time in 28 years.   This bill is the result of a wholly bipartisan process that includes  important provisions that will benefit all our constituents.                                time  1500    This includes further prohibitions on spoofing calls, reports on  promoting internet access for low-income veterans, and improving 911  caller information.   The bill also provides additional funding for the repack process and  fosters technology growth by authorizing studies on spectrum available  for future auctions.   I applaud the work of the subcommittee on getting this done. This  bill will truly benefit innovation and our constituents, and I support  its passage.
