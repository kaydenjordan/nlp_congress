 Madam President, yesterday, an overwhelming bipartisan  majority of Senators voted to move forward on Senator Hirono and  Senator Duckworth's anti-Asian hate crimes bill. I was pleased the vote  was so substantial, 92 to 6. Rarely do you see 92 Senators agree to  move forward with any piece of legislation. But if there was ever a  topic that deserves a strong showing of bipartisan support, it is  standing up to bigotry and racism against a particular group of  Americans.   Today, we will continue to work on a bipartisan agreement regarding  amendments. I have committed to start the process with the bipartisan  Moran-Blumenthal amendment. I understand my Republican colleague from  Maine has some modifications to the bill, which we welcome, and those  negotiations are proceeding afoot. I expect the Republican leader and  I, in consultation with the relevant committees, will be able to figure  out an appropriate number of reasonable, germane, and non-gotcha  amendments for the Senate to consider.   We are working with Senators Moran, Grassley, and Collins in a very  bipartisan way, and we should be able to wrap up this bill next week.  By doing so, the Senate will deliver a powerful message to Asian  Americans that their voices are heard, their concerns are felt, and  that their government will take swift, decisive action to protect them.  They are not alone.   Before I move on, I just want to say to my Republican colleagues:  This is how the Senate can work, even though it is closely divided.  When there is a pressing issue, like the rising tide of anti-Asian  violence, the Senate can act quickly and in a bipartisan way to address  it.   We don't need to always distrust the other party. This bill was never  intended to be a messaging bill or gotcha legislation. This bill is  like a drive straight down the middle of the fairway--well-timed,  modest, unobjectionable.   At the end of the day, we can achieve a result that has both  substantive and symbolic importance: substantive because we are going  to adjust the focus of the Justice Department to better respond to  anti-Asian hate crimes and symbolic because both parties are standing  up to deliver a message that racism and bigotry have no place--no  place--in America. That is an undeniably good result                            ____________________     Madam President, on another, less happy, matter, this  afternoon the Senate will need to go through a rare procedure to  discharge a nomination from the Judiciary Committee: Ms. Vanita Gupta  to serve as Associate Attorney General.   The daughter of immigrants from India, Ms. Gupta is the first civil  rights attorney and the first woman of color to ever be nominated for  Associate Attorney General, the third ranking official at the  Department of Justice. Her public track record is nothing short of  exemplary.   In her very first case after law school, Ms. Gupta won the release of  several African Americans who had  [[Page S1952]]  been wrongly convicted by all-White juries in Texas, clients who  eventually won a pardon from Texas Governor Rick Perry. She continued  her work at the ACLU, where she launched a bipartisan criminal justice  reform effort, before going on to lead the Civil Rights Division of the  Justice Department under President Obama.   Despite her sterling credentials, some of my Republican colleagues on  the Judiciary Committee would have you believe that Ms. Gupta is some  hair-raising, leftwing radical. In her hearing, Ms. Gupta was  unfortunately subjected to a mind-numbingly repetitious line of  questions about whether or not she supports the police or wants to  decriminalize all drugs.   A conservative judicial organization launched a national ad campaign  to smear her nomination. It was disgraceful. Just yesterday, a  Republican Senator on the Judiciary Committee grilled another DOJ  nominee, Kristen Clarke, over an obviously satirical piece she  published for her college newspaper.   The political right seems to relish trying to score political points  by connecting every Justice Department to hot-button partisan issues,  whether or not they have any relevance, sometimes to the point of  absurdity. And in the case of Ms. Gupta, the accusations of radicalism  are especially false.   Ms. Gupta has worked with stakeholders and legislators from all  corners, including a number of Republican Senators, during various  criminal justice reform efforts. She has been endorsed by--listen to  this--the National Fraternal Order of Police. Let me repeat that so my  colleagues hear it. She has been endorsed by the National Fraternal  Order of Police, as well as the International Association of Chiefs of  Police, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, and the  National Sheriffs' Association. It is making the decrying that she is a  crazy leftwing radical just absurd, and you wonder how and why they  come to that conclusion.   Vanita Gupta will make an outstanding Associate Attorney General. The  Senate should discharge her nomination from the Judiciary Committee  this afternoon.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session,  and I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, pursuant to S. Res. 27, the Judiciary  Committee being tied on the question of reporting, I move to discharge  the Senate Judiciary Committee from further consideration of the  nomination of Vanita Gupta, of Virginia, to be Associate Attorney  General.    Thank you, Mr. President.    The Senator from Utah has graciously yielded back his  remaining time, so I ask unanimous consent that I speak for a brief few  minutes and then we vote.    And then yield back the rest of our time after that.    Madam President, the Senate will soon vote on a motion  to discharge the nomination of Vanita Gupta to serve as the next  Attorney General--Associate Attorney General. The daughter of  immigrants, she would be the first woman of color and the first civil  rights attorney to serve as Attorney General.   Ms. Gupta is an exceptional nominee and an outstanding lawyer. It is  confounding that her nomination has been tied up in the Judiciary  Committee, requiring the Senate to take the extra procedural steps to  move her nomination forward. But despite Republican obstruction, she  will be confirmed by this Chamber in a few minutes.   Ms. Gupta's credentials speak for themselves. She most recently  served as president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and  Human Rights and served 4 years at the Justice Department.   Her first case after law school involved securing the release of  several African Americans wrongly convicted by all-White juries in  Texas.   At a time when so many in our country call for action against civil  injustices and racial violence, how can we not install one of the  Nation's top civil rights lawyers at the Department of Justice?   Senate Republicans, rather than evaluate Ms. Gupta on the merits of  her accomplishments, have spent the last few weeks appealing to  outlandish accusations that she is an out-of-touch, far-left radical.   The questions she endured during her confirmation hearing were  utterly inane--from accusations that she is anti-police to the  insinuation that she wants to legalize all drugs. A conservative  judicial organization even launched a shameful national ad campaign to  smear her reputation--her nomination. These smear tactics are nonsense.   Gupta commands the respect of civil rights advocates and law  enforcement and has the endorsement from the National Fraternal Order  of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, the Association of  Chiefs of Police, and the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association.  There is no mystery to Ms. Gupta's broad support. She is outstanding at  what she does. She knows how to listen and work with others, including  Republican Senators, and is deeply knowledgeable in the field. That is  exactly--exactly--she is exactly the kind of person we need at the  Department of Justice.   So I look forward to now moving on Ms. Gupta's nomination.   I yield back the rest of our time.
