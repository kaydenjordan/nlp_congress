 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2883, the  Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act, introduced by my  friend and Great Plains colleague to the south, Markwayne Mullin.   This bill could not come at a better time. As we continue to have  discussions in this country about both our future as an energy leader  and our trading relationship with Mexico and Canada, it is time to  review bureaucratic permitting processes that constrain new energy  transportation projects. This bill does just that. It improves and  streamlines the permitting process for pipelines and energy  transmission equipment when they are crossing U.S. international  borders.   Energy trade within North America is a nearly $150 billion business  that provides significant benefits here at home. This bill shows that  we can focus on protecting our environment and being an energy leader.  It maintains full environmental reviews and continues compliance with  the National Environmental Policy Act.   We saw how broken our current regulatory structure was when politics  and personal interests nearly ended the Keystone XL pipeline without  any regard to science, facts, or the livelihoods of the people who  needed those jobs. This legislation will allow American entrepreneurs  to stop fighting endless red tape and uncertain timelines and get back  to doing what we do best: creating jobs, innovating, and making North  America a leader in energy production.   Voters have told us time and time again to get the bureaucratic  morass of Big Government out of the way. They have asked us to promote  an all-of-the-above energy strategy that includes oil and gas and to  unleash the power of free trade and American innovation. They have  asked for good jobs and more energy security.   I thank my good friend from Oklahoma for sponsoring this. I ask my  colleagues to support H.R. 2838, the Promoting Cross-Border Energy  Infrastructure Act.
