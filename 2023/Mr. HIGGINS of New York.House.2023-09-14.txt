 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  nearly 150,000 United Auto Workers, including 3,000 members in western  New York at the Ford Stamping Plant and General Motors plants in  Tonawanda and Lockport.   Autoworkers have historically weathered the storm to support the  automotive industry, through the Great Recession and economic hardship.  Now, during a time when companies are experiencing record profits, the  people delivering the goods deserve a contract that recognizes the  critical role they play in that success.   UAW members will be an important part of the next generation of  manufacturing, making electric vehicles more accessible and readily  available.   As the September 14 deadline approaches, negotiators must come to the  table with a contract that includes competitive wages and rewards  quality work.   I ask my colleagues to join me in solidarity with the UAW as they  negotiate a secure future for the workers driving success in the  automotive industry today.                            ____________________
