 Mr. Speaker, look, things have changed a lot since the  9/11 Commission. Back then, we did not have a problem on either side of  the aisle condemning anti-Semitic remarks. Now one side has a problem  doing that.   Back then, we had never, in the history of Congress, had one party  commit what arguably is felony, up to 20 years in prison, by preventing  an ongoing session of Congress, the exact charge, 18 USC 1512, that is  being alleged against people that came in. As a judge, I would have no  problem sentencing anybody that broke into the Capitol, anybody that  committed a crime here.   But let's be real. The partisanship has been dramatic. That is why it  is different now than the 9/11 Commission. Let's get back to being  bipartisan and not use every tool as a partisan stick to beat  Republicans with.    Mr. Speaker, this is a very sad time in America. As was  discussed earlier today in debate, we used to have bipartisan  agreements on things. One of those was when anti-Semitism was raising  its ugly head. One party here on the floor still speaks up against,  will vote against anti-Semitic statements and call them out for what  they are, and another will not.   I heard my friend across the aisle, Brad Sherman, just appropriately  decrying the violence, these anti-Jewish folks in California, this  incident. Well, that surely could be something we could once again,  come back together in a bipartisan way and condemn the 40 percent rise  in violence against Semitic people. It is time to come together on  that. It will show the world.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, here is an article by Tristan Justice:  ``April job numbers are so bad, CNBC thought it was a typo.''   Another article: ``New stimulus package: Unemployment benefits, $300  per week extended till September.''   ``America's Vanishing Workforce,'' article by Megan Cassella and  Rebecca Rainey.   And this one, The Hill: ``It is time for States to take the lead in  getting Americans back to work,'' by Anthony Hughes.   Why is that? It is because we have an administration that is doing  everything it can in conjunction with the Democrats in Congress to keep  people from going back to work.  [[Page H2599]]    Now, when I was between my sophomore and junior year at Texas A&M, I  was accepted on an exchange program for the summer to the Soviet Union.  And at one point, being out at a collective farm many miles outside of  Kiev, I couldn't tell what was cultivated and what wasn't. It looked  brown. It didn't look good. But all the farmers in the middle of the  morning--10, 10:30--they are sitting out under a tree in the shade, and  they are visiting.   And I tried to have a smile and use my best Russian. And I asked,  ``When do you work out in the field?'' Because I had stood there for a  while. And they all laughed, and I thought maybe I didn't say it right  in Russian.   And finally one of them said, ``I make the same number of rubles if I  am out there in the sun as I do in the shade, so I stay in the shade.''   I got a message from one of my friends, a lady, that says her yard  guy says he can't get people to come back to work. He has got 125  yards. And her hairdresser's kids, they are not working, all because of  this big bonus if you don't work. It is time to get people back to  work, having them earn their money. America will be better for it.
