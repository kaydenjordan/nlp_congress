 Mr. President, in 1993, I voted against the North  American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. At the time, I was concerned  about a number of issues, including that NAFTA would not adequately  protect American jobs--manufacturing jobs in particular--and also  lacked sufficient environmental protections.   Today, I voted yes on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement that will  replace NAFTA because it will substantially improve upon NAFTA, and in  the process benefit California and the United States.   There are several provisions in the agreement that will help  California, including greater access to Canadian agricultural markets,  including dairy; labor provisions that go far beyond past trade  agreements; and $300 million to help address pollution from the Tijuana  River. It also includes $215 million and renewed authorization for the  North American Development Bank to address pollution along the U.S- Mexico border, a provision that comes from legislation I introduced  with Senator Cornyn.   The agreement sets new standards for labor protections in a trade  agreement. The agreement will require Mexico to make major improvements  to its labor laws, including collective bargaining reforms,  establishing independent labor courts and union dispute-resolution  bodies, and eliminating compulsory labor. It will substantially improve  monitoring and enforcement of these labor reforms in Mexico, and make  the enforcement process easier. For example, the agreement will  establish benchmarks for Mexico's compliance with its labor obligations  that will trigger a new labor-specific enforcement mechanism if those  obligations are not met.   The updates to NAFTA include several provisions that will help  California's agricultural producers, including increasing access to  Canada's dairy market. The agreement also puts wine, beer, and spirit  products from each country on a more level playing field.   I recognize that some critics think we can do more to protect the  environment and fight climate change, and I agree. But we can't make  the perfect the enemy of the good, and this agreement takes important  steps in that area. In addition to fighting pollution along the  southern border, the agreement provides increased funding for  environmental compliance monitoring and enforcement, helps prevent  illegal and unregulated fishing and trafficking of wildlife, protects  marine species, affirms each country's commitments to international  environmental agreements, and makes it easier for countries to issue  regulations in the public interest.   This agreement is a step in the right direction, in large part due to  important improvements made by House Democrats. Those improvements  helped secure many of the strong labor  [[Page S264]]  and environmental provisions I have just mentioned.   These updates to NAFTA will also go a long way toward stabilizing our  trade relationships with Mexico and Canada--two of the most important  trading partners for California and the Nation. Canada and Mexico are  two of the largest trading partners with the United States, each  accounting for more than $600 billion in trade. The two countries are  California's two largest export markets, buying nearly $50 billion of  California's exports each year.   Finally, it is notable that this agreement has broad bipartisan  support, which I think is a sign that Congress can still work together  to get important things done.    Mr. President, I am pleased to join my Judiciary  Committee colleagues, Chairman Graham and Senator Durbin, as the lead  cosponsor of the ``Temporary Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency  Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act.''   This bill will ensure that fentanyl-related substances remain in  Schedule I and will help deter the manufacture of fentanyl-related  substances responsible for overdose deaths.   In 2018, the number of fentanyl-related deaths in the United States  increased from 28,000 to 32,000.   This is more than double the number of heroin-related overdose  deaths. It is a staggering number of lives lost that we simply cannot  accept.   To address the increasing deaths, the Drug Enforcement Administration  (DEA) issued a temporary order to control fentanyl-related substances,  or fentanyl analogues, as a class.   That order is set to expire on February 6th.   Based on the information my office has received from the DEA and the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is clear that this order  has been effective.   The number of law enforcement encounters of new fentanyl analogues  has decreased from 8 to 2. That is significant and means that the order  has reduced the supply of new fentanyl analogues by 75 percent.   This decrease in supply has reduced the need for widespread  prosecutions of fentanyl-related offenses. In fact, since the DEA's  order went into effect, it is my understanding that there has only been  two related prosecutions.   Additionally, although the number of fentanyl-related overdose deaths  has continued to increase, the rate at which these deaths has increased  has declined significantly.   For example, between the 12 month periods ending January 2017 and  January 2018, fentanyl deaths increased by nearly 36 percent.   Comparatively, between the 12 month periods ending May 2018 and May  2019, which is the latest data available, the rate of fentanyl deaths  only increased by just over 9 percent.   I would have preferred a long-term solution to addressing this  problem that can gamer strong bipartisan support, and I am eager to  continue working with my colleagues on such a solution.   However, given the limited amount of time that we have before the  DEA's temporary order expires, we cannot sit idly by and do nothing.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  legislation. Given the staggering number of overdose deaths associated  with fentanyl-related substances, inaction is not an option.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Ms. Murkowski):   S. 3203. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to codify the  requirements for appointment, qualifications, and pay for therapeutic  medical physicists of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
