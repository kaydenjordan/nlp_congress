 Mr. Speaker, while serving our country, many of our brave  men and women were exposed to large plumes of black smoke and cancer- causing toxins from the burning of waste, chemicals, and plastics in  burn pits. Now veterans from across the country who have no other risk  factors are developing terminal cancer, leaving their families to  wonder why, families of heroes like Jenn Kepner's, a 39-year-old Air  Force veteran who died of pancreatic cancer late last year.   That is why today I am proud to announce the bipartisan Congressional  Burn Pits Caucus, to help seek answers for our heroes exposed to burn  pits. Representative Brad Wenstrup and I have started this caucus  because bureaucratic red tape at the VA and the DOD is denying our  veterans the answers they deserve and the care they need.   We can't afford to wait. I urge every Democratic and Republican alike  to join the Congressional Burn Pits Caucus and start fighting for our  veterans to get the care they need and deserve.                            ____________________
