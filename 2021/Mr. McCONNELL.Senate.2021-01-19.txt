 Mr. President, I understand that the Senate has  received a message from the House of Representatives that it has taken  action relative to impeachment, though it has not yet transmitted the  article of impeachment to us.   I ask that pursuant to rule I of the Rules of Impeachment, the  Secretary of the Senate notify the House that the Senate has received  its message.    Mr. President, the last time the Senate convened we  had just reclaimed the Capitol from violent criminals who tried to stop  Congress from doing our duty.   The mob was fed lies. They were provoked by the President and other  powerful people, and they tried to use fear and violence to stop a  specific proceeding of the first branch of the Federal Government which  they did not like.   But we pressed on. We stood together and said an angry mob would not  get veto power over the rule of law in our Nation, not even for one  night.   We certified the people's choice for their 46th President.   Tomorrow, President-Elect Biden and Vice President-Elect Harris will  be sworn in. We will have a safe and successful inaugural right here on  the west front of the Capitol--the space that President Bush 41 called  ``democracy's front porch.''  [[Page S50]]    And then we will move forward. Our work for the American people will  continue, as it has for more than 230 years. There are serious  challenges that our Nation needs to continue confronting, but there  will also be great and hopeful opportunities for us to seize.   Certainly, November's elections did not hand any side a mandate for  sweeping ideological change. Americans elected a closely divided  Senate, a closely divided House, and a Presidential candidate who said  he would represent everyone.   So our marching orders from the American people are clear. We are to  have a robust discussion and seek common ground. We are to pursue  bipartisan agreement everywhere we can and check and balance one  another respectfully where we must. And through all of this, we must  always keep in mind that we are all Americans, we all love this  country, and we are all in this together.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on a related matter, a great deal  has already been said about the disgraceful events of January 6. More  will be said in the weeks ahead.   I understand the FBI has already made at least 100 arrests, and the  Justice Department reports more than 275 persons under investigation--a  number that is climbing fast. I want to commend the work of the  Department to swiftly investigate and bring offenders to justice.   As I have stated, January 6 saw failures of institutions, protocols,  and planning. Those failures did not just leave Congress itself  exposed; they also left the courageous men and women of the Capitol  Police themselves in a totally untenable situation.   So today, I want to reaffirm the huge respect and gratitude that I  have--and I believe all Senators have--for the men and women of the  U.S. Capitol Police who put their own safety on the line every single  day that they clock in and stand guard.   Neither the institution of Congress nor the American people will ever  forget the bravery and the valor of Officer Brian Sicknick, who  sacrificed himself to protect this place and those inside it.   We will not forget our friend Officer Howard Liebengood.   And we will never forget our debt to all the brave CP officers and  their families.   It is more than just comforting to come to work in a place protected  by such fine men and women, at risk to themselves. It is also very  humbling.   We are also grateful to the local officers from DC, Virginia, and  Maryland, to Federal law enforcement officers, the National Guard, the  Secret Service, and all the other professionals who helped subdue the  criminals and secure the Capitol on the 6th and are working together to  protect peace and order this week.   Tomorrow, a new President and Vice President will swear their oaths  of office. They will also do so safely and securely because so many  brave men and women have sworn their own oaths to support and defend  our Constitution.   We salute you all.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at  the desk due a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceeding.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have 3 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority leaders.

Res. 5, submitted earlier  today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 4:30 p.m.,  Wednesday, January 20; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for  their use later in the day; finally, that following leader remarks, the  Senate be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the provisions of S. Res. 5 as a further mark of respect for the  late Officer Brian David Sicknick of the United States Capitol Police.   Thereupon, the Senate, at 4:05 p.m., adjourned until Wednesday,  January 20, 2021, at 4:30 p.m
