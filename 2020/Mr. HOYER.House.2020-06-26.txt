 Mr. Speaker, I am going to leave my mask on, not only  because it is the safe thing to do for all of you--not for me, for  you--but also because it represents the best of America.   I am from Maryland. Maryland was a slaveholding State. I represent  the district that probably had the most slaves, along with my friend  from the First Congressional District.                                time  1000    In fact, there were many sympathizers for the Southern cause that  would have had Marylanders join the Confederacy. They were, of course,  wrong. But I want to tell my friends from those States that withdrew  and whose States tried to destroy the Union that they ought to remember  that this Nation took them back without condition with full citizenship  and the right to vote. Surely we can do the same for our fellow  citizens.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, and I thank  Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton in her extraordinary quest keeping her  eye on the prize to make sure that the citizens she represents have  full citizenship and have our respect. I am proud to stand with her in  supporting statehood for the people of the District of Columbia.   On this mask, there is a drawing of the outline of the District of  Columbia. That is Maryland before the 1789 and subsequent actions. That  was Maryland. I daresay, there is not a Marylander who voted on that  secession of that land for the Capital of the United States who thought  to themselves they were disenfranchising those who lived in that  District.   I want to thank Mayor Bowser, with whom I have been proud to work to  move this issue forward with the leadership of Delegate Holmes Norton.  I made clear when we announced that the House would consider this bill  today that the people who call our Nation's Capital home have been  disenfranchised and shortchanged too long.   Martin Luther King said: How long?   Too long.   Not only have the residents of one of America's most historically  African-American cities--let me repeat that--historically, it is one of  our largest African-American cities. It is not exclusive. It is a  diverse city. Very frankly, it does not make a decision, if you don't  vote for us, we will not allow you to vote.   Hear me: If you don't vote for us, we will not allow you to vote.   But President Trump says that my friends on the other side of the  aisle, Mr. Speaker, would be foolish to vote for this bill. Why?  Because we are too Democratic and we wouldn't vote for you.   What do you think the North would have done with the 11 States that  tried to destroy the Union if we had said: You are not going to vote  for us, so you can't come back--at least, you can't come back with  voting rights, and we will keep you as subjects, not as citizens?   I hope every Member who represents one of those States thinks about  that proposition as you vote to exclude 706,000 of your fellow citizens  from full participation in our democracy.   Not only have the residents of one of America's great cities been  prevented from having full citizenship, but they have also been  shortchanged in the money that we give them. Just recently, COVID-19,  we gave them 40 percent of what we gave Wyoming, an entity 200,000  people smaller than the District of Columbia.   I see no heads shaking on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker. I  see no agreement on that.   Should we say Wyoming is too small and that we ought to exclude  Wyoming, it is not big enough to be a State?   Yet Wyoming, more than 10 times smaller than the State of Maryland  and, as opposed to 40 million people in California, 500,000, one- eightieth of the size, have two United States Senators.   Stand up if you think Wyoming ought not to have a vote.   I see no one standing.   This constitutional argument is a Don Quixote windmill argument.  These are 706,000 American citizens. At the same time, their elected  leaders can be overruled by Congress and by the President when it comes  to local issues, as we saw when President Trump ordered Federal law  enforcement and the National Guard to suppress peaceful and legitimate  protest against the killing of Black men and women in encounters with  the police and with others. George Zimmerman comes to mind and Trayvon  Martin.   This is about human rights. This is about democracy. This is about  our Nation being better than that.   I see my colleague from Maryland shaking his head. We disagree.   The people of D.C. deserve not only real self-government, but also  full representation in the Congress of the United States.   Are these 700,000 people less than the 500,000 people in Wyoming?   If we ask somebody to come to the District of Columbia and work for  our government, is the condition that they lose their citizenship, that  they lose their full voting rights? Is that the condition we put on  them? If so, I respectfully disagree with my colleagues who believe  that is what America is about.   That is what this historic legislation would do, admit Washington,  D.C., as the 51st State. That would provide residents of the District  of Columbia with a voting House Member and two Senators, as every other  group of Americans who lives in a jurisdiction called a State has the  right to have.   It would right a historical wrong to ensure that our Founders' vision  of representative government will be enacted for all Americans, no  longer excluding the 706,000 in the District of Columbia.   The House will take action today to make the District of Columbia a  State. It is an historic day.   Be on the right side of history. So many voted against the Civil  Rights Act of the 1960s and years thereafter. They were on the wrong  side of history.   The gentleman is absolutely right. Somebody mentioned it was  Democrats. We were a segregationist party. And guess what? We said we  do not want to be that kind of party, and Hubert Humphrey got up in  1948 in New York at a Democratic convention and said that we need to  come out of the dark shadows of slavery and segregation into the bright  sunlight of justice and equality.   Yes, I understand that was our party. We said to them: We do not want  to be that party.   Don't you be that party. Don't you have Lincoln turn over in his  grave and say: That is not our party.   Yes, I heard the gentleman over there. Sadly, in the denial of  democracy, the Republican-led Senate has indicated, Mr. Speaker, it  will not act, just as it has not acted on 275 bipartisan bills that we  have sent to the United States Senate. They will not act.   The majority of the Senate is elected by 18 percent of the American  people. That is unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, because this is more than  just a local issue for the District of Columbia. It is a civil rights  issue for our country, as yesterday was a civil rights issue for our  country.   It is something that ought to concern all Americans, because when  some Americans are denied the full rights and representation of  citizenship, it diminishes the meaning of citizenship for  [[Page H2537]]  all. Statehood is not merely a status; it is a recognition by the rest  of the States of the sovereign equality of the people who live there  that they are part of the main, not simply an island, as the poet  reflected, and that they cannot be treated as lesser by their fellow  citizens.   By admitting Washington, D.C., as a State, we will admit what we  already know to be true: that its people are our fellow Americans,  equal in their pursuit of happiness and their enjoyment of the full  rights and privileges of American citizenship, including representation  in the Congress of the United States.   Our patriot forebears in the 18th century used to cry out, ``No  taxation without representation.''   The citizens of Boston stole some tea, a criminal act, and they threw  it into the Boston Harbor. Why? They said: Because we will not be taxed  without representation and that King George cannot tell us what to do  without consulting us.   Be on the right side of history. Washington residents correctly still  use that battle cry in the 21st century. Let us make it ring true at  last. Let us make our Union of States a more perfect one by adding to  its number as we have 37 times consistent with the Constitution.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand up for America, stand up  for democracy, and stand up for the premise of America that every  person counts. Vote ``yes.''    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for his  respect.   Is the gentleman aware that the District of Columbia was reduced in  size historically a while back so that the land was reduced?   This is what is happening here. There is clear precedent for doing  this.   I thank the gentleman for yielding.    I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding.   Madam Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning- hour debate. I would repeat that because it is unusual. On Monday, we  are meeting at 9 a.m. for morning-hour debate and 10 a.m. for  legislative business, with votes expected to occur as early as 2:30  p.m.   On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning- hour debate and 10 a.m. for legislative business.   On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.   The House will consider H.R. 1425, the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Enhancement Act. This bill will significantly increase  the ACA's affordability and subsidies, lower prescription drug prices,  expand coverage, and crack down on junk plans, while strengthening  protections for people with preexisting conditions and addressing  racial health disparities.   The House will also consider, Madam Speaker, H.R. 7301, which is the  Emergency Housing Protection and Relief Act of 2020. This bill would  authorize nearly $200 billion for the dire housing needs arising due to  the COVID-19 pandemic.   H.R. 7301, which was included in the HEROES Act, would help renters  and homeowners by extending the eviction and foreclosure moratoria and  providing $100 billion for emergency rental assistance; $75 billion for  homeowners assistance to cover mortgages, property taxes, and  utilities; and more than $11 billion for homeless assistance programs.   I would again reiterate that that bill passed as a part of the HEROES  Act, which is now pending in the Senate.   Lastly, the House will consider H.R. 2, the Moving Forward Act. This  bill would invest more than $1.5 trillion in modern, sustainable  infrastructure, while creating millions of good-paying jobs; combating  the climate crisis; and addressing disparities in urban, suburban, and  rural communities.   The bill includes a 5-year reauthorization of the surface  transportation program, invests in schools with the Reopen and Rebuild  America's Schools Act, invests over $100 billion in our Nation's  affordable housing infrastructure, delivers affordable high-speed  broadband internet access to all parts of the country, and promotes new  clean renewable energy infrastructure.   We expect, at that point in time, to be out on Thursday for the July  Fourth break. I would tell the House that the 2 weeks that will follow  the July  [[Page H2558]]  Fourth weekend will be reserved, as were the first weeks in June, for  committees to do their work, in particular, the National Defense  Authorization Act being considered by the House Armed Services  Committee.   That bill is, obviously, very lengthy. It composes a little more than  half of the discretionary spending, and we expect the committee to need  substantial time to mark up that bill.   In addition, the Appropriations Committee will be marking up its 12  bills for consideration by the House.   Then, the last 2 weeks, we will be taking the products that will not  be limited to the NDAA and the appropriations bills, but we will be  primarily taking up the time with other legislation that will be  promoted and sent to the floor for consideration by the committees.    Yes. I talked to Mr. McCarthy yesterday. Obviously,  because of the timeframe that the COVID-19 health strictures have  imposed upon us, it takes a long time to vote on amendments. So, rather  than consider amendments individually, the leader and I talked about  having amendments either in manager's amendments or in amendments that  have a lot of individual amendments within them. And they will be  considered en gros so that there may well be a lot of amendments, but  we hope to hold the votes down to a manageable level.   As the gentleman knows, votes have been taking about an hour. If we  took every amendment seriatim, frankly, we wouldn't finish until  September. So, we are trying to manage that, and we are working with  the minority leader.    No, it turns out that we considered the bill in the House  the same way the majority leader in the Senate wanted to consider the  Scott bill, or the Republican policing bill. So, both Houses wanted to  consider them, apparently, in the same way.    Will the gentleman yield?    We are hopeful that the Senate will pass a bill. I know  that my friend will say, Well, yes, but it is the Democrats that  stopped the bill.   Let me tell the gentleman, I genuinely hope that we have a bill  passed by the Senate, that we go to conference, and that we adopt a  bill that can garner the support of the majority of the House and the  Senate and can be signed by the President of the United States.   As I said on the floor when we considered the bill, Karen Bass, the  Congressional Black Caucus, and those of us who strongly supported the  bill, we don't want to send a message. We want to make a difference. To  the extent that making a difference requires us to have agreement  between the two parties, I am hopeful we will get to that objective.    Will the gentleman yield?    The gentleman will surely note that when his party was in  power and was scheduling bills, you had the most closed rules of any  Congress in the history of the Congress.    First of all, of course, I reject emphatically the premise  that this is absurd. As the gentleman knows, there were some 70, some  weeks ago, who cast a vote. There were 30 today. They cast their votes  because they were concerned about their health or families' health to  whom they would return.   I think the gentleman probably has been reading, as well, and maybe  listening to the extraordinary spike in cases that have been identified  and the concern that hospital beds will be overrun.   We will end this when the medical community, not somebody who has no  medical knowledge and very little command of the facts, tells us it is  time to get together again. When he told people to do that, they did  get together, 10 of whom apparently work for the White House who have  gotten infected, and, frankly, spikes in Florida, Texas, Arizona, and,  yes, even California and some other States as well, including Arkansas.   Now, I am not sure exactly what the figures are in the gentleman's  State. But, Madam Speaker, I believe that we are going to continue to  be concerned about the health of the Members, the health of the staff,  the health of the people who cover us on behalf of the American people.    So, I can't tell the gentleman whether it is going to end because I  can't tell you when the pandemic is going to end.  [[Page H2559]]  I can't tell you when the spike in the numbers of people who are  getting sick or people who are dying is going to end.   But I can tell you that we will be very sensitive to the risks, and  we will act accordingly.    Will the gentleman from Georgia yield?    I hesitate to ask the gentleman a question I don't know  the answer to, so I won't. But I don't know which Governors the  gentleman is talking about. But I will, certainly, want to find that  out from the gentleman at some point in time.    Let me tell the gentleman that we certainly intend to  continue, as I said, to try to protect the American people. A lot of  people have died. Over 122,000 people have died.    The President of the United States said this virus was a  hoax.   Because he said it was a hoax, people thought they didn't have to  worry about it. I tell my friend from Georgia, a hoax. He is a  gentlemen who refuses to set the example of wearing a mask, which the  science and medical people say we ought to do, a gentleman who really  shunted aside much of the science and medical advice that he got.   So I tell the gentleman we hope that the President is as concerned as  my friend has stated he is, and I know that I am and I think all of our  Members are.    Will the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, I hope the gentleman has as high an  expectation for the President of the United States as he has of others.
