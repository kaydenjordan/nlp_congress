 Mr. Speaker, I will cast my vote today to lower the  cost of prescription drugs, tackle the climate crisis, and make big  corporations pay their fair share in taxes while putting people over  politics.   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle love to  rant about fiscal responsibility, but the facts are clear: Every time a  Republican President and congressional majority collude for their  corporate friends and the rich elite, our deficits soar. So, it is up  to Democrats to clean up that mess.   This Inflation Reduction Act is a historic downpayment on deficit  reduction of approximately $300 billion to fight inflation.   For years, Nevadans have seen their cost of living rise, while my  Republican colleagues across the aisle have focused on giving away tax  cuts for the wealthy. Well, today, we vote for seniors, in my district  and across America, who want one thing from Congress right now, and  that is to lower prescription drug prices.   Today, we will cast our votes to pass the Inflation Reduction Act  because it includes an important provision to cap out-of-pocket drug  costs at $2,000 per senior and to cap insulin costs at $35 a month for  seniors and individuals with disabilities.   Finally, the Inflation Reduction Act includes a historic step to  combat the climate crisis, including $4 billion to States like Nevada  to combat the effects of the two-decades-long Western drought.   Mr. Speaker, I urge this body to pass this legislation for the  people, putting people over politics.  [[Page H7658]]
