 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues  in expressing support of S. 2747, a bill to amend the Federal Election  Campaign Act of 1971 to extend the Administrative Fine Program for  certain reporting violations.   As the expiration deadline of December 31, 2023, approaches rather  quickly, we, the Members of the House of Representatives, have an  opportunity to continue the trend of bipartisan oversight of the  Federal Election Commission.   If passed, S. 2747 will mark the seventh time that lawmakers have  recognized the administrative importance and financially beneficial  structure of the Administrative Fine Program.   As the former Florida Secretary of State, I know firsthand that  voters will always seek transparency from political candidates and  political campaigns.   Elections officials have a saying: Elections are partisan. Elections  administration is not.   This bill is an example of that very principle. It is an example of  the transparency and the confidence that Americans want to see in their  elections. These same themes can be found in the American Confidence in  Elections Act, which passed out of the Committee on House  Administration in mid-July and is an example of the types of procedures  and principles and laws that can be guidance for every State in  America.   Today, we have the opportunity to showcase the cooperation, the  diligence, and the work completed by members and staff on the Committee  on House Administration and the Senate Rules Committee. This bill  reflects our shared values, bipartisanship, transparency, and good  governance.   I urge my colleagues to support S. 2747 so the Federal Election  Commission can continue to ensure confidence and transparency in our  elections process.
