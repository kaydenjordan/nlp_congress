 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise a proud American,  proud to be a citizen of the greatest country in the world, proud to  proclaim that I am a liberated Democrat, speak truth to power, truth  about power, unbought and unbossed.   I am also proud to be aided today with my mnemonic notes. I would  like to talk to you about invidious discrimination in the United States  of America, the greatest country in the world.   I know of no one in this House who believes that invidious  discrimination is appropriate. I believe that every Member of this  House will go on record indicating that invidious discrimination should  not exist in this, the greatest country in the world.   But what I would like to do is give some empirical evidence of the  existence of this invidious discrimination and then say a word or two  about possible remedies.   Newsday had a testing investigation. On November 17, 2019, Newsday  released a scathing report detailing an investigation into the nature  and extent of real estate sales practices on Long Island in New York.   Now, do not confuse the fact that this was in New York on Long Island  with the notion that it doesn't happen in other places. It could have  happened in my city, Houston, Texas, and my belief is it happens every  day in a good many places around this country.   The evidence continues with this. The report, titled, ``Long Island  Divided,'' was the culmination of a 3\1/2\ year comprehensive  investigation entailing 240 hours of secretly recorded meetings with  real estate agents and analysis of 5,764 house listings.   It appears that the Newsday report revealed a 19 percent rate of  discrimination against Asian Americans, 39 percent rate of  discrimination against Latinos, and 49 percent rate of discrimination  against African Americans.   It appears that the persons who were the agents, the agents who were  the persons being spoken to by persons seeking opportunities, it  appears that these agents refused to provide service to customers of  color--some of them, not all of them.   They showed borrowers of color far fewer homes than their White  counterparts, provided inaccurate information to borrowers of color,  made inappropriate statements based on race, placed higher requirements  on borrowers of color, and steered potential customers based on race.   Nobody in this House would agree to this as appropriate. Everybody in  this House, I believe, would condemn this. But here is where the rubber  meets the road.   It is one thing to condemn it and to say that it is wrong. That is a  talking point. We can have the greatest talking points in the world,  but this will continue until we make those talking points an action  item.   There are things that we can do to prevent this level of invidious  discrimination. The question is not whether there is a way. The  question is: Do we have the will to challenge and take on this level of  invidious discrimination?  [[Page H1194]]    Because of the many remedies proposed, the one that stands out the  most is that of increasing the fund for fair housing testing, to do  exactly what they did with this report, to go into various venues and  test and acquire this empirical evidence.   Nobody wants to see this happen, but we cannot stop it by simply  talking about it. We have to have an action, and the action item is  testing.   I will be saying more about this later on this week because there is  legislation right here pending in this House that we can bring to the  floor of this House, pass, and we can prevent this kind of behavior  from taking place because, when we acquire the empirical evidence, we  can then confront those who do this. We can also educate them, and we  can pass on a legacy to future generations of success in ending  invidious discrimination.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the chairperson, and the  ranking member as well, for bringing this legislation to the floor  today. I also thank the majority leader, who happens to be in the room.   Madam Speaker, this piece of legislation is more than 100 years in  the making, and it does deal with lynching, but truth be told, more  than a lynching took place.   Emmett Till's body was mutilated. He was shot in the head, and he was  thrown in the Tallahatchie River. His mother insisted on an open  casket. This was the thing that sent shock waves across this country,  causing people to rethink what was happening in the South.   Yes, he was lynched. Yes, this is the unfinished business of this  House. And we have much more unfinished business.   Madam Speaker, I do want to commend Congressman   Bobby Rush for the  outstanding job that he has done, as well as his cosponsors, in  bringing this legislation to the floor. It is time. In fact, it is past  time. And I am grateful that this House is taking up this legislation.
