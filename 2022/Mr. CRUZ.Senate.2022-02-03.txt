 Mr. President, there is a gathering storm in Europe. I rise  today to discuss the brewing crisis posed by Russia's aggression and,  tragically, how the reckless actions of President Biden have enabled  it.   This morning, all 100 Senators participated in a classified briefing,  where we heard from the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State  and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. We heard about the  magnitude of the threat from Russia.   We stand here today with Europe facing the greatest peril it has  faced since 1945. These are ominous and chilling times, and we did not  arrive here by accident. Right now, 150,000 Russian troops are directly  on the border of Ukraine, poised to invade, with more troops and more  tanks arriving each and every day. It was also reported this week that  Russia has sent additional blood supplies to its military equipment on  the Ukraine border, another ominous signal that Russia plans to invade.   Ukraine, and indeed the region and the world, find ourselves in this  crisis because of President Biden's weakness, because of his  appeasement, because of his surrender to Putin over the last year. And  now, instead of rising to meet this moment with strength and resolve,  President Biden continues to shrink from it with more weakness than  appeasement.   One question that was raised in the briefing this morning is, Why  didn't this happen in 2017? Why didn't it happen in 2018? Why didn't it  happen in 2019? Why didn't it happen in 2020? What changed?   I will suggest what changed. What changed is the occupant of the Oval  Office, who has demonstrated weakness and appeasement virtually from  the moment he rested his hand upon the Bible. It is a pattern.   As a result of President Biden's weakness and appeasement, this  administration gave Afghanistan to the Taliban and 13 American  servicemembers were tragically murdered.   As a result of President Biden's weakness and appeasement, this  administration is ramping up to give a nuclear arsenal to the Ayatollah  in Iran. The very same Ayatollah who chants ``Death to Israel'' and  ``Death to America,'' the Biden administration is preparing to  facilitate that Ayatollah having the weapons of mass murder to carry  out those pledges.   As a result of President Biden's weakness and appeasement, the Biden  administration is in the process of ceding Taiwan to Xi. President  Biden has even banned any Taiwanese official from displaying a  Taiwanese military uniform or displaying a Taiwanese flag on U.S.  Government property. Why? Because it offends the communist Government  in China.   And, again, right now, today, as a result of President Biden's  weakness and appeasement, the Biden administration is in the process of  abandoning Ukraine to Vladimir Putin.   Putin didn't just wake up one day and decide to invade Ukraine. He  has wanted to invade Ukraine for years. And he did so in 2014, but he  stopped short of a full invasion then because he couldn't endanger  Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which Putin needs to get Russian  natural gas to Europe. So Russia formed a consortium to build Nord  Stream 2, a pipeline stretching directly from Russia to Germany under  the sea so that Russian gas could circumvent Ukraine altogether.   We have long known about the dangers Nord Stream 2 poses. That is  why, in the last few years, Democrats and Republicans here in the  Senate have come together repeatedly and taken bipartisan actions,  passing sanctions on Nord Stream 2 with overwhelming majorities.   I led that effort, drafting the Cruz-Shaheen sanctions. They were  supported by every Democrat in this Chamber. They passed  overwhelmingly, and they worked. They succeeded. They stopped the  pipeline literally the day they were signed into law.   The story of how that happened is well known to every Senator in this  Chamber, as is the story of how the new President--President Biden-- inexplicably and catastrophically decided to squander that hard-fought  geopolitical victory and turn a victory for America into a loss for  America and our allies.   Many a Democratic Senator standing on this Senate floor has quietly  expressed frustration, confusion, anger why the Biden administration  would surrender to Russia and give away the victory we had won.   It is not only the decision to surrender on Nord Stream 2 and give  [[Page S511]]  Putin the pipeline that enables him to invade Ukraine that led to this  day. Also, for the past year, President Biden has repeatedly  systematically undermined our Ukrainian allies in the face of Russian  aggression to placate Putin.   And it is worth noting, Biden does this for the same reason he  undermines Taiwan. He undermines Taiwan to placate the Chinese  communists. He undermines Ukraine to placate Putin. To placate Putin,  the Biden administration has repeatedly withheld military aid packages  to Ukraine. Other times, he has withheld diplomatic support to pressure  our Ukrainian allies into supporting his misguided Nord Stream 2  surrender to Putin. Biden's actions for the past year have emboldened  Putin, who acted on that weakness and has put Europe on the brink of  war.   So what can we do right now today to promote peace and stop an  invasion?   Well, our Ukrainian allies have told us again and again what we can  do and what we should do. All we have to do in the Senate is listen to  our friends in Ukraine who are on the frontline: No. 1, sanction Nord  Stream 2 immediately, right now, today; No. 2, give the Ukrainians  weapons so that they can defend themselves.   Just last week, the chairman of Ukraine's Parliament wrote a letter  to the Senate about exactly this. If you have not read the letter from  the Ukrainian Parliament, I commend it to you. It is an extraordinary  letter from a nation on the brink of annihilation at the hands of  Russian aggression. I am going to read parts of that letter right now  because it is worth quoting extensively.   The chairman of Ukraine's Parliament writes:         Nord Stream 2 is a source of multidimensional security,       political and economic threats to Ukraine and Europe as a       whole. It is not an exaggeration that Nord Stream 2 is no       less an existential threat to Ukraine's security and       democracy than the Russian troops on our border. This       pipeline must be stopped and the only way to prevent the       completion is to use all the tools available to do that.    The letter continues:         So far, the decision to waive sanctions against Nord Stream       2 in May 2021--    That was a decision by President Biden--       has emboldened Russia and caused Moscow to conclude that the       United States may accommodate its hostile intentions.    The letter continues:         After a clear majority of the U.S. Senate voted 55-44 in       favor of imposing immediate sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG, on       January 13, 2022, it is essential that Congress include       immediate sanctions against Nord Stream 2 AG in any new       legislation to undercut options for Russia's aggressive       actions on Ukraine.    The letter goes on, asking for a ``clear trigger for the instant and  unqualified imposition of any sanctions that are not imposed  immediately upon enactment of the legislation,'' arguing that ``while  some sanctions--like sanctions against Nord Stream 2--should be imposed  immediately to demonstrate to Moscow that the United States is, indeed,  serious about serious measures, including removing Russia from SWIFT,  the trigger of these future sanctions must be clear in order to be  effective.''   The letter continues:         A ``significant escalation in hostilities,'' whose ``aim or       effect of undermining, overthrowing, or dismantling the       Government of Ukraine, occupying the territory of Ukraine, or       interfering with the sovereignty or territorial integrity of       Ukraine'' is too high of a threshold to deter Russian       aggression or affect the Kremlin's cost-benefit calculus.    The Ukrainians are crystal clear in this letter. The sanctions on  Nord Stream 2 that Biden waived last year, in the words of the  Ukrainians, ``emboldened Russia'' and allowed Putin to think ``the  United States may accommodate its hostile intentions.'' In other words,  because of Biden's weakness and appeasement on Nord Stream 2, Putin  thinks there are no serious consequences to invading Ukraine.   So the Ukrainians are asking--they are begging of the U.S. Senate-- for immediate sanctions on Nord Stream 2. Do not abandon them. They cry  at their hour of need.   And they also state in the letter that ``expedited and higher-impact  security assistance, including air defense, anti-ship, and anti-armor  capabilities'' is what they need.   That is what the Ukrainians have asked for, but President Biden and  most of the Senate Democrats aren't doing what our Ukrainian allies  have called for. Instead, they are looking to pile appeasement on top  of appeasement, and they are doing it in secret. The Biden  administration has offered Putin sweeping concessions on NATO when it  comes to troops, when it comes to missiles, when it comes to military  exercises. They transmitted this appeasement to Putin in secret and  refused to let Americans see the details.   I have seen the details, and I can tell you, they are deeply  worrying. The reason the public hasn't seen them is the administration  has placed them in a secure SCIF. They are not classified, mind you.  They are merely ``confidential,'' which is Washington speak for  politically embarrassing, and the administration doesn't want to defend  the substance of it.   That is why I am introducing legislation called the PARTNER Act,  which would prevent President Biden from endangering our longtime  allies and frontline countries in NATO by prohibiting him from removing  American troops from the countries that border Russia--meaning Estonia,  Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania, and Poland--longtime allies. My  legislation will prevent President Biden from offering yet more  appeasement to Russia, from offering for America to abandon Eastern  Europe to Russia, and from allowing President Biden to fatally  undermine NATO.    I also want to address the fact that some think we should stand down  and not resist Russian aggression because they say Biden will send  American troops into Ukraine and start a shooting war with Russia if  Putin invades. I want to be clear and unequivocal: We should not have  American soldiers in Ukraine. Under no circumstances should we send our  sons and daughters to die to defend Ukraine from Russia. If the Biden  administration proposes that because their foreign policy is collapsing  around that, I will vigorously oppose such a move and the vast majority  of Americans do, as well.   But, critically, the Ukrainians aren't asking for that. Ukraine is  not asking for a single American soldier. Ukraine is saying, Do two  things: Sanction Nord Stream 2, the pipeline that enables the Russian  aggression; and provide them with the military weapons so that they,  the Ukrainians, can fight to defend their own Nation from the invading  Russian Army.   So Americans are asking: Why should we care what happens to Ukraine  or what happens to NATO countries that border Russia?   Let me be clear. There are some who justify American foreign policy  and say we have an amorphous obligation to protect democracies; we have  an obligation to protect international norms.   I think all of that is bunk. We have an obligation to protect the  national security of the United States of America. The Commander in  Chief's obligation is to keep Americans safe.   What does that mean in this context?   Well, I want to make four points. No. 1, what Putin is trying to do  is reassemble the USSR. If he succeeds in doing so, it would be  catastrophic for global stability and American security. Putin and  Russia are an enemy of America. When the Soviet Union was bigger,  stronger, mightier, and with a bigger military, the lives of Americans  and the lives of our allies were in far greater jeopardy. It is  overwhelmingly in America's interest to prevent Putin from reassembling  the Soviet Union because we do not wish for our enemies to become  stronger and use that strength against us.   No. 2, Putin is trying to seize control of energy. If he is  successful, it will be felt by Americans filling up their cars with gas  or trying to heat their homes in the winter. We have already seen what  Putin has done with Nord Stream 2, and he is not going to stop there.   No. 3, we have a formal obligation--a commitment the United States  made--to help the Ukrainians defend themselves. Why is that? Well,  after Ukraine successfully declared independence from the USSR in 1991,  the United States signed an agreement, an agreement called the Budapest  Memorandum on Security Assurances. With the Budapest Memorandum, under  the terms of it, Ukraine agreed to give up its nuclear weapons. Ukraine  had the third largest stockpile of nuclear weapons on the face of the  planet. America  [[Page S512]]  agreed, quite reasonably, that the world would be safer if Ukraine did  not have nukes, and the brandnew Ukrainian Government agreed and gave  up their nuclear weapons, making America safer and the world safer.   But the Ukrainian Government did not do so for nothing. It did so in  exchange for explicit assurances that the United States would protect  Ukraine's territorial integrity. Let me reiterate that. The United  States made a formal commitment to the Ukrainians that if they gave up  their nuclear weapons, we would help them protect themselves. The  Ukrainians are asking us to honor our commitment in the form--and they  are very specific about what they are asking--in the form of immediate  sanctions on Nord Stream 2 and weapons so they can defend themselves.   We need to send them that lethal aid, the kind of firepower the  Ukrainians need to defend themselves, not the blankets and teddy bears  and meals that the Obama administration sent the last time Russia  invaded Ukraine.   No. 4, we have treaty obligations to NATO countries on the frontlines  of Putin's aggression. Putin wants NATO to withdraw foreign forces,  including American forces from the countries that border Russia--from  Bulgaria, from Poland, from Romania, from Estonia, from Latvia, from  Lithuania. But to withdraw American forces from NATO would be seen as-- in fact, it would be--an abdication of our commitment to NATO. It would  either shatter the NATO alliance, the most successful alliance in  modern history, or it would put into motion dynamics that would  ultimately shatter NATO, which is why, as I mentioned, I am introducing  the PARTNER Act, to prevent the Biden administration--their weakness  and appeasement--from destroying NATO and undermining American  security.   On every one of these four points, Biden has demonstrated weakness  and appeasement to Putin. And I would note that you might ask: Why  should America honor our commitments? Why should we honor our  commitment in the Budapest Memorandum, honor our treaty commitments to  the NATO countries? Because one of the ways we protect American  national security is when we make an agreement with a country--when we  make a formal, legal agreement--we honor our commitments. And we want  countries to know that we stand by our friends, that we stand by our  word, that our treaties mean something, because if countries learn that  under weak and feckless Presidents, our treaties--our formal, binding,  legal documents--aren't worth the paper they are written on, it  undermines the ability of any President of the United States to  negotiate agreements with our friends and allies that keep Americans  safe.   When Ronald Reagan was standing up and confronting the ``Evil  Empire,'' we saw the virtues of peace through strength.   Biden's foreign policy seems to invite war through weakness. There  are actions we can take today, like sanctioning Nord Stream 2, like  sending lethal aid to Ukraine, like committing to keep our NATO forces  in countries that border Russia.   All of these actions would show Putin that the United States will  stand up to aggression and defend our national interests. We should  take these actions without delay. We should stand in bipartisan unity  in support of American national security, in opposition to Russian  aggression. If we do not, if the Senate acquiesces to Biden's weakness  and appeasement and Russia invades Ukraine and, weeks from now, there  are Russian tanks in the streets of Kyiv, Ukraine and Europe and  America and the world will reap the whirlwind.   This is our opportunity to act. I pray that we take it.   I yield the floor.
