 Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Franks of Arizona). The gentleman from  California is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Franks of Arizona). The gentleman from  California is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I support competition, and these  competitions, as a whole, have been beneficial to the Department of  Defense.   The OMB has reported that, regardless of whether the Federal  Government or the private contractor win the competition, the act of  competition alone has saved or generated a cost savings up to 10 to 40  percent--10 to 40 percent, just having the competition.   This amendment would block opportunities for the defense industrial  base, protect the status quo within the DOD civilian workforce, prevent  cost savings at the DOD, and negate the natural innovation that comes  from competition.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would say we have a duty to taxpayers to  perform the best we can, to give the best product to our warfighters at  the best price. I urge a ``no'' on this amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.
