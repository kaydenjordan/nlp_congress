 Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, first, today I would like to turn  attention to the severe weather that is afflicting communities  throughout my home State.   Nearly 20 counties from one end of the State to the other have  declared states of emergency in response to historically high water  levels. Just moments ago, Governor Matt Bevin put  [[Page S1410]]  the entire Commonwealth under a state of emergency to mobilize  resources where they are needed most. Many families are evacuating  toward safety. Approximately 2,400 people in eastern and southern  Kentucky are still without power. Mudslides have closed roads. Bridges  are flooded, and emergency personnel have been deployed to rescue  stranded drivers and others in danger.   I want to express my gratitude to the first responders working around  the clock to keep their communities safe. It may be a difficult road to  recovery, but Kentuckians are already pitching in to help their  neighbors in need.   My staff and I are ready to work with emergency management officials  and will continue to monitor the situation closely.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, this  week the Senate will resume our work in the personnel business by  considering yet another of President Trump's qualified judicial  nominees.   Eric Miller has been chosen to sit on the Ninth Circuit Court of  Appeals, and one look at his legal career to this point says he is well  prepared to do so.   Mr. Miller is a graduate of Harvard and the University of Chicago,  where he served on the Law Review editorial staff. He has held  prominent clerkships on both the DC Circuit Court of Appeals and the  U.S. Supreme Court. His record of public service at the Justice  Department and in private practice reflects a legal mind of the highest  caliber.   I hope each of my colleagues will join me in voting to advance the  first circuit court nominee of this new Congress. That will be 31 since  President Trump took office. But first, in just a few hours, the Senate  will vote on advancing a straightforward piece of legislation to  protect newborn babies. This legislation is simple. It would simply  require that medical professionals give the same standard of care and  medical treatment to newborn babies who have survived an attempted  abortion as any other newborn baby would receive in any other  circumstance. It isn't about new restrictions on abortion. It isn't  about changing the options available to women. It is just about  recognizing that a newborn baby is a newborn baby, period.   This bill would make clear that in the year 2019, in the United  States of America, medical professionals on hand when a baby is born  alive need to maintain their basic ethical and professional  responsibilities to that newborn. It would make sure our laws reflect  the fact that the human rights of newborn boys and girls are innate;  they don't come and go based on the circumstances of birth. Whatever  the circumstances, if that medical professional comes face-to-face with  a baby who has been born alive, they are looking at a human being with  human rights, period.   To be frank, it makes me uneasy that such a basic statement seems to  be generating actual disagreement. Can the extreme, far-left politics  surrounding abortion really have come this far? Are we really supposed  to think that it is normal that there are now two sides debating  whether newborn, living babies deserve medical attention?   We already know that many of our Democratic colleagues want the  United States to remain one of seven nations in the world that permit  elective abortions after 20 weeks--seven countries, including North  Korea, China, and the United States of America. But now it seems the  far left wants to push the envelope even further. Apart from the entire  abortion debate, they now seem to be suggesting that newborn babies'  right to life may be contingent--contingent--on the circumstances  surrounding their birth. Well, evidently, the far left is no longer  convinced that all babies are created equal, but the rest of us are  still pretty fond of that principle.   My colleagues across the aisle need to decide where they will take  their cues on these moral questions. On the one hand, there are a few  extreme voices who have decided that some newborn lives are more  disposable than others. On the other side is the entire rest of the  country.   I would urge my colleagues: Let's listen to the voices of the  American people. Let's reaffirm that when we say every life is created  equal, we actually mean it. Let's vote to advance the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act later today.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, later this week, Leadership Tri-County  from Knox, Whitley, and Laurel Counties in my home State will present  one of its highest honors: the Leader of the Year award. I was  delighted to learn this year's title will be given to Ernest Matt  House, a lifelong resident of London, KY, and a remarkable example of  entrepreneurship. I would like to take a few moments today to pay  tribute to Ernest Matt and his many accomplishments in Kentucky.   From an early age, Ernest Matt's talents were on full display. In  high  [[Page S1430]]  school, he excelled both in the classroom and on the field, earning 14  varsity letters and a place in the Kentucky High School Athletic  Association's Hall of Fame, but these achievements, of course, were  just the beginning. Ernest Matt received a full scholarship to play  football at Eastern Kentucky University. There, he was EKU's starting  quarterback for 3 years and lettered all 4. His notable time in the  Colonel's uniform merited inclusion into the school's athletic hall of  fame, and he still ranks among the best quarterbacks in its history.   After his graduation, Ernest Matt returned to Laurel County and began  working at his family's grocery store. Named for both of his  grandfathers, he had big shoes to fill in the family business, but it  didn't take long for Ernest Matt to learn the competitive business and  set his sights on the future. Although a lot has changed in the grocery  business and in the community, Ernest Matt holds onto the tradition of  personal service that keeps bringing loyal customers back to the store.  Over the next years, his continued entrepreneurial success earned him  distinction both in the local community and across the Nation.   Leadership Tri-County was established more than three decades ago to  foster and develop emerging local leaders. Its programs in Kentucky  invest in the men and women who have spent their lives making their  communities a better place to live. This award is given each year to an  individual who has contributed to the area's growth and development,  and Ernest Matt clearly fits the bill. Through his business success and  service on local, regional, and State board and commissions, Ernest  Matt has quite a legacy of achievement.   A man of deep faith, Ernest Matt credits his good works both to  Christ and to his loving family, especially his wife Kim. I am sure  she, along with his children and grandchildren, are quite proud of him.  Kentucky has been made better because of Ernest Matt's many  contributions, and I would like to congratulate him for being named the  2019 Leader of the Year. I encourage my Senate colleagues to join me in  recognizing his work.                            ____________________
