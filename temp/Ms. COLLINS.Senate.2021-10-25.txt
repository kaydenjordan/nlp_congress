 Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator  Tina Smith, to introduce the Medicare Mental Health Inpatient Equity  Act, legislation that eliminates Medicare's arbitrary 190-day lifetime  cap on inpatient services in psychiatric hospitals. Given the steps  that Congress has already taken to establish parity and improve  coverage of mental health services, this change is long overdue,  particularly as the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the already alarming  trends in the mental health of some Americans.   Notably, an estimated 13.1 million adults aged 18 or older in the  United States are living with serious mental illness, representing 5.2  percent of all adults nationwide. These illnesses, such as  schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are chronic conditions that require  ongoing treatment and care over a lifetime. When left untreated, they  can be some of the most debilitating and destructive illnesses  afflicting Americans.   Unfortunately, our current mental health system is fragmented, and  these individuals all too often lack access to the care that they need.  That is why I have worked to improve mental health services across the  lifespan and break down barriers to treatment. The legislation I am  introducing today eliminates another barrier in Medicare, the 190-day  lifetime cap on inpatient services in psychiatric hospitals.   Most Medicare beneficiaries treated in inpatient psychiatric  facilities qualify because of a disability. As such, this current  restriction disproportionately impacts non-elderly Medicare  beneficiaries--mainly those living with schizophrenia and bipolar  disorder who may be diagnosed at a younger age and stay on Medicare  longer as a result. Sadly, it is young adults aged 18 to 25 years who  currently have the highest prevalence of serious mental illness of any  age group.   Furthermore, no other Medicare inpatient service has these types of  arbitrary caps, which is why elimination of Medicare's lifetime cap was  a recommendation of the 2016 White House Mental Health and Substance  Use Disorder Parity Task Force. While I recognize that this cap was  originally intended to limit the Federal Government's role in paying  for long-term custodial support of the mentally ill, keeping a cap on  inpatient days at psychiatric hospitals--particularly for patients who  have been living with serious mental illness from a young age-- undermines patient treatment options and can lead to disruptive  transitions of care.   During their life, people with serious mental illnesses may need  repeated psychiatric inpatient hospital stays to manage their condition  and regain quality of life in their community of choice. The 190-day  lifetime limit can hurt people by arbitrarily ending coverage and can  disrupt care from a provider who is most familiar with the patient.  Moreover, when individuals with mental illness cannot receive care in  the right setting, they often end up in hospital emergency rooms, in  jails, or on the streets--leading to worse long-term outcomes for the  individual, more pain and suffering for family members, and a greater  cost to the taxpayer.   Outside a psychiatric inpatient hospital, it is difficult for many  healthcare facilities to meet the treatment needs of those suffering  with severe mental illness. Many general hospitals lack psychiatric  care capacity, and there are countless examples of psychiatric boarding  in emergency departments. Skilled nursing facilities may also not be  best suited to provide the complex and specialized psychiatric care  these beneficiaries need. Finally, too many patients find themselves  receiving care in prisons, or not at all, if they are on the streets or  are on long waitlists for care. As one local sheriff in Aroostook  County recently told me, ``Law enforcement is not equipped to handle  individuals with mental health challenges and yet we are faced with  that reality every day.'' Similarly, a behavioral health provider in  Presque Isle, ME, said, ``Imposing a limit may appear to reduce cost;  however, the true cost-and toll-on community resources is far greater  than any savings incurred by Medicare.''   On top of all of these existing challenges, it is clear the COVID-19  pandemic has increased stress and isolation, disrupted care services,  and dramatically changed everyday life and even living environments for  many Americans. With research pointing to greater psychological  distress during the pandemic for people with mental illnesses, already  a particularly vulnerable population, I fear we will be trying to make  up for lost strides in behavioral health care for years to come. Now  more than ever, we must work on commonsense reforms that provide parity  between behavioral and physical health care, as well as strive to  increase access to support and improve care coordination.   As the American Hospital Association, which endorses this bill, said,  ``As we work to further integrate physical and behavioral health to  better address the nation's behavioral health needs, one major obstacle  to parity remains in the Medicare program--the 190-day lifetime limit  on coverage for certain inpatient psychiatric treatment. With the  nation's population aging and an increasing number of seniors and  people with disabilities seeking inpatient care to address their  behavioral health needs, now is the time to repeal this discriminatory  policy and ensure that Medicare beneficiaries can receive necessary  inpatient psychiatric care.''   The pandemic may have had a disastrous effect on the mental health of  the Nation, but it has also led to more visibility and the  understanding that individuals with serious mental illness, their  families, and the communities in which they live do not have access to  the care and resources they need. I hope we can use what we have  learned throughout the pandemic as an opportunity to reduce stigma and  make overdue reforms like removing the 190-day lifetime cap on  inpatient services in psychiatric hospitals.   Our legislation, the Medicare Mental Health Inpatient Equity Act, is  supported by a wide range of organizations, including the American  Hospital Association and the Mental Health Liaison Group, a coalition  of 57 national organizations representing consumers, family members,  and mental health and addiction providers. This includes support from  the National Association of Behavioral Healthcare, the American  Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the  National Alliance on Mental Illness, and Mental Health America.   I urge my colleagues to support this important critical legislation  to bring greater mental health parity to the Medicare Program and give  those suffering with serious mental illness access to the care they so  desperately need.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the material be printed  in the Record.    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                  American Hospital Association,                                   Washington, DC, October 20, 2021.       Hon. Susan M. Collins,       Senate,       Washington, DC.       Hon. Tina Smith,       Senate,       Washington, DC.         Dear Senator Collins and Senator Smith: On behalf of our       nearly 5,000 member hospitals, health systems and other       health care organizations, our clinician partners--including       more than 270,000 affiliated physicians, 2 million nurses and       other caregivers--and the 43,000 health care leaders who       belong to our professional membership groups, the American       Hospital Association (AHA) is pleased to support your       legislation, the Medicare Mental Health Inpatient Equity Act.         On the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, America's       hospitals and health systems witness firsthand its far-      reaching effects on behavioral health. The stress from       unemployment or underemployment, isolation due to quarantine       or COVID-19 restrictions, and grief over loved ones lost to       the pandemic are possible to manifest in increases in already       high rates of deaths from suicides and substance use       disorder. Beyond COVID-19, we know that as a country to       prioritize resources that support the behavioral health needs       of the country. These investments will not only help to       stymie the wave of unmet demand for behavioral health       services that has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic,       but also improve America's overall health.  [[Page S7341]]          As we work to further integrate physical and behavioral       health to better address the nation's behavioral health       needs, one major obstacle to parity remains in the Medicare       program--the 190-day lifetime limit on coverage for certain       inpatient psychiatric treatment. With the nation's population       aging and an increasing number of seniors and people with       disabilities seeking inpatient care to address their       behavioral health needs, now is the time to repeal this       discriminatory policy and ensure that Medicare beneficiaries       can receive necessary inpatient psychiatric care.         We are grateful for your leadership on this issue and       stand ready to work with you to enact this important       legislation.             Sincerely,                                                     Stacey Hughes,       Executive Vice President.                                   ____                                      Mental Health Liaison Group,                                   Washington, DC, October 18, 2021.       Hon. Susan Collins,       Senate,       Washington, DC.       Hon. Tina Smith,       Senate,       Washington, DC.         Dear Senators Collins and Smith: The Mental Health Liaison       Group (MHLG)--a coalition of national organizations       representing consumers, family members, mental health and       addiction providers, advocates and other stakeholders       committed to strengthening Americans' access to mental health       and addiction care--is writing to express our strong support       for the Medicare Mental Health Inpatient Equity Act. This       critical legislation eliminates the discrimination against       mental illnesses that continues to exist in the Medicare       program as Medicare beneficiaries are limited to 190 days of       inpatient psychiatric hospital care during their lifetime.       This lifetime limit does not apply to psychiatric units in       general hospitals and there is no such lifetime limit for any       other Medicare specialty inpatient hospital service.         Through passage of landmark legislation, the Paul       Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and       Addiction Equity Act of 2008, Congress put coverage for       mental health and substance use disorders on par with other       medical disorders. Also, that year, Congress enacted       legislation to equalize the Medicare outpatient coinsurance       for mental and physical health. Despite this progress,       discrimination against Medicare patients with mental health       disorders who require ongoing psychiatric treatment and       hospitalizations, when in crisis, continues to exist.         The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission reported that       most Medicare beneficiaries treated in inpatient psychiatric       facilities qualify for Medicare because of disability, hence       they tend to be younger and poorer that the typical Medicare       beneficiary. These Medicare beneficiaries live with serious       mental illnesses (such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder)       and who are living with these disorders from a relatively       young age. These illnesses are chronic and will require       ongoing treatment and care over their lifetimes, including       hospitalization when in crisis.         The elimination of the 190-day limit will equalize       Medicare mental health coverage with private health insurance       coverage, increase access for the most seriously ill, improve       continuity of care and create a more cost-effective Medicare       program.         The MHLG applauds your bipartisan leadership and looks       forward to working with you and your staff to enact this       important legislation.
