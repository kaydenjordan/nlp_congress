 Mr. Speaker, I oppose this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is in a long line of attacks from a hostile  administration, and some of my Democratic colleagues, against oil and  gas, conventional fuels, which has blessed our country with a safe,  affordable abundant supply of energy. It fuels our economy. It keeps  energy costs low for consumers and working families. It gives us energy  independence.   In addition to the Paris climate and millions of jobs going away in  the future as we implement that, pipeline and critical infrastructure  cancelations, public land drilling moratoriums, weaponizing the tax  code--because that is what is next--as they do away with ordinary and  necessary depreciation and general business expenses, the posture from  my colleagues is hostility toward an industry that has been so good to  this country and to working families.   In this case, we would go back to the Obama-era regulatory regime  that is costly and burdensome, not to the multinational oil and gas  companies. They welcome it because they will just increase their market  share. It is the mom and pop, small business, independent producers who  make up 85 percent of the production of oil and gas. They can't take  this. They will shut their doors. We will shutter family-owned small  businesses.   And for what?   Trace amounts of methane gas. The cost benefit does not make any  sense. This is a sledgehammer-to-a-fly approach. The real emitters on  methane gas, if that is your goal, downstream, large-scale industrial  utilities, and other industrial operations, that is where we ought to  focus. That is what the Trump administration focused on, gave room for  innovation, respected State regulation, and that partnership and  Federalism.   Mr. Speaker, that is my position. I implore my colleagues to join me  in opposing this and get back to some reasonable approaches to  stewarding our environment and economic growth.
