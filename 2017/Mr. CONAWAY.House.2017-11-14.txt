 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman holding this  hour tonight.   In September of this year, we celebrated the 230th birthday of our  Constitution, a document that has provided for the governance of this  great people for 230 years.   The history behind that was that the States in 1787 decided that the  Articles of Confederation were not properly forming a nation that could  protect itself properly. So they sent really smart men to Philadelphia  to fine-tune--or tweak--the Articles of Confederation.   James Madison and others had a different idea. They locked the doors,  they went into closed session, and they came forth with a Constitution  that we have lived under for the next 230 years.    Benjamin Franklin, who was the oldest Framer, emerged from that  experience and was asked by a woman, whom we think was named Mrs.  Powell. She said: Good Doctor, what have you given us, a monarchy or a  republic?   He looked her in the eye and said: ``Madam, a republic, if you can  keep it.''   That is a daunting phrase, Mr. Speaker, and it is one that carries  forward now for 230 years. It never ends. It is not a one-and-done  circumstance.   So the question arises: How, in fact, do we keep a republic?   Mr. Speaker, only a free, self-governing people can keep a republic.  As was previously quoted by my colleague from Louisiana, John Adams  wrote that only a moral and religious people can self-govern.   Mr. Speaker, as I look at our Nation today, I am deeply concerned  that we are losing that moral high ground to be able to maintain the  moral authority, in fact, to self-govern. We each say the Pledge of  Allegiance often. There is a line in that pledge that says, ``One  nation under God,'' with no comma.   Mr. Speaker, think about that juxtaposition, ``One nation under  God.''   What does God see when He sees our Nation today? What does He see in  America that can, in fact, please Him?   He sees a nation that has come to accept the killing of 57 million  babies in the last 44 years. He has seen a nation whose family units  are breaking up and the impact it has on the moral guidance of  children. He has seen a coarsening of our society, a language that is  unsuitable, a filthiness and commonness that, quite frankly, offends  Him at every level.   Mr. Speaker, you and others listening to me tonight, I think, have  their own list of things that God looks at and cannot and simply will  not bless.   How do we turn that around? How do we reclaim that moral high ground?   I am going to argue, Mr. Speaker, that that is an individual job. I  don't think any of us would argue that we can legislate this work,  because this is a work of each of our hearts.   Mr. Speaker, I think you reclaim this moral high ground by living a  moral code. I live the Judeo-Christian model. Jesus Christ is my  personal savior. I try to live his tenets every single day. Some days I  am better at it than others. Each of those days, I am simply a sinner  saved by grace. That grace of God has provided the story of that, and  how that works is provided for us in the Bible that we celebrate  tonight.   Mr. Speaker, each one of us has to live a code that, in fact, can  create moral and religious people. Each of us in this body take an oath  every 2 years--those of us who are fortunate to get reelected--to  defend and protect the Constitution against all enemies foreign and  domestic.   We have got good men and women in uniform tonight who are putting  their lives between us and some really bad guys as a result of that  oath of office.   I'm going to ask each of my colleagues here tonight to think about  what they are willing to put on the line to protect and defend the  Constitution, to help create that moral fiber, and to reclaim that  moral high ground that will, in fact, allow us to continue self- governance and, by extension, protect this Republic.   That used to be the easy thing to do, Mr. Speaker, but the voices  against us, the voices of intolerance are growing louder and louder  every single day. It will come at a risk to stand up for those Biblical  truths on which this country was founded and which have sustained her  for some 230 years.                                time  1900    Are you and I, in fact, willing to take those risks, take the risk of  being ostracized, being ridiculed, being made fun of because we stand  up for the truths that all of us know built and sustained this country?   I certainly hope we are because we have got young men and women in  uniform who put their lives on the line, and I am going to ask you to  put your reputation and mine on the line to help create and maintain  this Republic.   As Benjamin Franklin said: ``A Republic, if you can keep it.'' These  are strong words for a strong-hearted people who must reclaim the moral  high ground that God, in fact, continues to bless.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that God bless each one of us, that God continue  to bless Texas, and that God bless the great United States of America.
