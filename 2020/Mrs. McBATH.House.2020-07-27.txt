Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, we remember the life and legacy of Congressman  John Lewis. We mourn his passing, but we celebrate his incalculable  contributions to our country. The world is truly a better place because  John dedicated his life to make it so.   I rise in front of this Chamber as we vote to create the commission  on the social status of Black men and boys. This commission is only  possible because of the barriers broken by Black men like John Lewis.  It is only possible because of the tireless efforts of Black women like  Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, who has led the introduction of this  bill.   The world has changed for Black men and boys in this country since  John Lewis was beaten and bloodied on a bridge in Selma, Alabama. We  have come a long way, but it is no secret that Black men and boys  continue to face unjust hurdles in America. The commission will search  for ways to address these inequities, from education to unemployment,  housing to healthcare, justice to civil rights.   As John once said: We have a moral obligation, a mission, and a  mandate to do what we can to make our country and our world a better  place and to help usher in a loving community where no one is left out  or left behind.   I believe this commission will help us do just that. I believe that  it will help us create a better future for our children and for our  grandchildren because while we have come so far, we still have a long  way to go.   I know that you can do everything right as a parent and still see  your child, a young Black man, taken away from you for reasons that are  far out of your control.   When I got pregnant with my son, Jordan, he was a miracle for me. I  wasn't sure I was ever going to be able to have children. I dreamed of  who Jordan would become. I dreamed of watching him walk across the  stage at his high school graduation, full of love and full of hope for  the future.   But almost 8 years ago, Jordan was sitting in the back seat of a car  with his friends at a gas station. A man pulled up, parked next to  them, and complained about the loud music that they were playing. He  pulled out a gun, and he fired 10 shots into the car, hitting Jordan  three times, killing my only son. And then, he simply drove away.   I believed I had done everything right, but at the end of the day,  Jordan was a young Black man. And I felt that injustice.   So while I look back at the life and legacy of John Lewis, and I  remark how far we truly have come, I must also look toward a future  without my son, and I see how far we still have to go.   As we vote today to create the commission on the social status of  Black men and boys, I hope we can go forward in strength and in hope  because there is always hope. It is what brings us together.   We can work toward a future that we all believe in, and I am proud to  take the next step on that journey today. I urge my colleagues to stand  with me in supporting this bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1100     Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr.  Armstrong, for such passionate and committed words toward truly making  sure that we have a just and fair society for everyone.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee), who is my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), who is our great fighter for justice.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley), who is an extraordinary warrior for  justice in America.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), who is my good friend and comrade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), who is a good friend and a committed  Member from the Sunshine State of Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Meeks), a stalwart for justice and hope.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu), who is a good friend and colleague fighting  on behalf of communities of color.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), the gentleman from my original home  State.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the gentlewoman from Florida  (Ms. Wilson), I read into the Record a statement.         Mr. Speaker, the Commission on the Social Status of Black       Men and Boys is a bill that is long overdue. The Commission       will review police brutality, gun violence, fatherhood,       recruiting and training Black male teachers, and even       speakers, which play an important role in the lives of Black       boys. Welfare reform and the 1994 crime bill--which includes       the controversial ``Three Strikes'' provision and harsh       sentencing guidelines--will also be revisited. These Federal       policies left a devastating impact on Black men and boys in       America.        The underlying goal of the commission is to interrupt the       school-to-prison pipeline and to better understand and,       eventually, eliminate the educational and social chasms that       have made it extraordinarily difficult for Black males to       become upwardly mobile.        Perhaps, the most dangerous issue facing Black boys in our       country is racism itself. Too often, they are perceived as       criminals by  [[Page H3877]]       the time they reach the age of 5. They are labeled       delinquent, not rowdy. They are hardened criminals, not       misguided youth. Their very existence is often seen as a       threat. It is a tragic reality that Black males in America       are treated as their own class of citizens.        We see this treatment reflected in social outcomes in such       areas as education, criminal justice, healthcare, and       employment. The numbers are staggering. More than 1 out of       every 6 Black men, who, today, should be between the ages of       20 and 54 years old have disappeared from our daily lives.       Low rates of high school retention among Black male students       directly relates to the high rates of joblessness and       incarceration.        More than two-thirds of Black male dropouts end up serving       time in State or Federal prison, and while Black males       overall make up roughly 13 percent of the United States       population, they represent nearly 40 percent of all men       serving time in State and Federal prisons.        Mr. Speaker, I am confident that the Commission on the       Social Status of Black Men and Boys will change the world for       so many people and create the paths to success that they have       been denied for generations, and, ultimately, close societal,       economic, and cultural divides.        Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Mr. Armstrong, and my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle for supporting our need to  really make systemic change in the country.   I also thank Congresswoman Wilson. If it had not been for her  legislation, I wouldn't be standing before you today.   Congressman Richmond and also Congressman Jeffries, Senator Rubio,  Senator Harris, and Senator Booker; it has been an honor to work with  each of them in bringing this bipartisan legislation to a vote.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their support for this very,  very critical bill, and I look forward to the important work that this  commission will accomplish on behalf of all Black men and boys and on  behalf of my son, Jordan. I am so grateful to this body for finding  this so critically important, so that no one will ever have to feel the  pain of losing their Black child, their Black male son to the  disparities and inequities that face communities of color each and  every single day. I thank every one of my colleagues. I thank the  thousands and thousands of parents that I have spoken to over the  years, and all of the survivors of the families who have lost their  loved ones. I thank them for finding this important. I thank them for  standing up and finding this timely in a world that doesn't always see  young Black males as human.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
