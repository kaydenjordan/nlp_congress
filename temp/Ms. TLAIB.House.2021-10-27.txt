 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Ms. Reasther  Everett, a long-time resident of Westland in Michigan's 13th  Congressional District, as we mourn her passing.   Ms. Everett was best known in the community for her volunteer work.  As coordinator for the Wayne County Retired Senior Volunteer Program,  she recruited, trained, and assigned volunteers. She also served as  family service advocate for Wayne County Family Center facilitating and  expediting adaptation to independent living arrangements for residents  and aided with placement in healthcare services.   Ms. Everett spearheaded the ``no family without Christmas program,''  collecting donations for the homeless during the winter holiday season.  Throughout her work with the Southeast Westland Homeowners Association,  Ms. Everett founded the SWHA Community Center where, for many years,  she operated an after-school program for young people.   Madam Speaker, please join me in recognizing the many contributions  of Ms. Reasther Everett to Westland, Wayne County, and Thirteenth  District Strong, as we honor her memory.                            ____________________
