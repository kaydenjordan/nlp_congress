 Madam Speaker, it is a fresh week in Washington. Last  week, division infected this Capitol, both sides, Republicans and  Democrats.   The State of the Union is supposed to be a time of coming together as  Americans, coming together to improve jobs, healthcare, the  environment, and the lives of hardworking men and women, seniors, and  their families.   On Friday, I couldn't wait to get home. I went home and spent time  with people in my district.   People donned costumes in the Michigan Law Enforcement Polar Plunge  for Special Olympics. I didn't jump, but I laughed.   The University of Michigan won a hard-fought game against Michigan  State. Yes, go Blue. And now, we come together as one Michigan.   We had serious, important conversations about the division in this  country and how we must come together.   As we work on the people's business this week, I hope we remember we  can disagree agreeably and respect others' opinions and the need to  listen to each other and understand different perspectives. We are all  Americans.                            ____________________
