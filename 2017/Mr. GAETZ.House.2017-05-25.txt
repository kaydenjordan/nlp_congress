 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, as a Floridian, I have to take a moment to share my  gratitude to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mast) for the remarks he  just shared.   During my occupancy of the rostrum, my own eyes welled with tears as  I thought of the empty chairs at the table in my own district and all  throughout the country as people, as families have made sacrifice and  sent those to fight for us.   I can only be reminded, hearing the gentleman from Florida's remarks,  that each and every day in this House we do fall short of that great  patriotism that is reflected by our servicemen and -women: We could do  better; we could be more worthy of the sacrifice; we could resist the  influences of special interests more; we could make the tough decisions  that are necessary; we could put America on a better footing forward.   It is my belief and my sincere hope, by hearing the words of my  colleague, by raising our gaze to an even broader and more accepting  patriotism, that we can do it. And I believe Mr. Mast will be one of  the people that lead us in that regard.
