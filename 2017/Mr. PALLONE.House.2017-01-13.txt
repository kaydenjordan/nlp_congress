 Mr. Chair, I have listened to every Republican who spoke  during this budget debate, and I am convinced they will repeal the ACA  and run. There will never be a replacement because they don't have the  votes for it. The Republicans are ideologues. They don't believe we  should regulate insurance companies or help people pay for their  premiums, so they can never support a replacement plan that would do  these things.   The ACA is a market-based plan to deal with the healthcare crisis  that we faced 8 years ago. More and more people didn't have health  insurance. Insurance companies wouldn't sell them health insurance if  they had a preexisting condition like cancer. People were paying more  and more out of pocket, and the fact of the matter is that we stepped  in in a practical way, not because we were ideologues, because we were  looking at the situation practically to help people.   What did we do? We provided 20 or 30 million people who didn't have  insurance with insurance. For those who had health insurance through  their employer, we guaranteed them a good benefit package, and we  limited their out-of-pocket costs. We looked at this practically  because we are trying to help the American people. We were not  ideologues. We didn't care about whether you were on the left or the  right.   But what the Republicans are doing today is really a farce. They  don't care about the average American. They don't care about all these  people who have insurance now who didn't have it before, about the  benefits that they are getting, that their out-of-pocket costs have  been limited. No. They are just ideologues. They want to repeal this.  They have no intention of ever replacing it, in my opinion, and they  want to go back to the good old days when the insurance companies  controlled the market. That is what we are going to have. Repeal and  run, that is what you are doing.
