 Mr. President, the right to vote is among the most sacred  rights guaranteed by our Constitution. It forms the foundation for our  democracy and inspires countless people across the world still striving  for a meaningful opportunity to engage in the political process and  shape their futures.   My friend John Lewis has often said that ``the right to vote is the  most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democracy.'' I could not  agree more with him. America is a stronger and greater country when  more Americans participate in our democracy. We are better when our  citizens hold their elected representatives accountable and voice their  opinions on the critical issues facing our Nation. We can take a  historic step to foster even greater participation in our democracy  simply by modernizing the way Americans register to vote.   Today, I am proud to introduce the Automatic Voter Registration Act  of 2017. This bill would require States to automatically register  citizens who are eligible to vote when they interact with State and  Federal agencies. Americans would have the option of declining  automatic registration, but this bill would provide for a registration  process that is easier for our citizens and one that is more efficient  and accurate.   The bill I introduce today streamlines the voter registration process  by providing for online registration and greater portability of  registration when an individual moves to a different location in the  same State. Under this bill, no one can be unfairly penalized for  inadvertent registration, and punishment is limited to cases of  intentional registration fraud or illegal voting. This bill also  includes important privacy protections and makes clear that the  information used to automatically register individuals will remain  secure. These are commonsense reforms that would not only help  Americans vote but also help maintain accurate and up-to-date voter  registration rolls.   Last year, Vermont became one of the States leading the country on  improving our citizens' access to the ballot by becoming one of just  eight States to approve automatic voter registration. I want to commend  Vermont secretary of state Jim Condos for his outstanding work on this  issue and for the people of Vermont.   State election officials estimate that tens of thousands of  Vermonters will now be registered to vote because of this new law.  Implementing these types of reforms nationwide will make America  stronger and increase participation of a broader electorate. A recent  study by the Center for American Progress on Oregon's automatic voter  registration law that went into effect in January 2016 found that more  than 272,000 people were added to voter rolls, and 98,000 of them were  new voters in the November 2016 Presidential election. That is a  remarkable success story, and hopefully other State legislatures will  take notice. The Brennan Center for Justice, which has been a leading  voice protecting Americans' right to vote, concluded in a 2015 report  that a comprehensive, nationwide automatic voter registration plan has  the potential to increase voter registration by 50 million eligible  voters. This would not only save money and increase accuracy, but it  would also reduce the potential for fraud and protect the integrity of  our elections.   I would like to thank the Brennan Center for Justice for its work on  this issue and for working with me on this bill. I would also like to  thank Senators Durbin and Klobuchar for joining me as original  cosponsors. Congressman Brady of Pennsylvania, the ranking member on  the House Committee on House Administration, has been a leader on this  issue and has introduced a House companion bill.   All members of Congress should support this legislation. We should  all  [[Page S3491]]  strive to make sure that our constituents have access to the ballot box  and are able to have their voices heard. This is of course just one  reform we must make to ensure that our citizens' voting rights are  protected. In the coming weeks, I intend to reintroduce legislation to  restore the full protections of the Voting Rights Act. It has now been  almost 4 years since the Supreme Court's devastating decision in Shelby  County v. Holder, and we have seen the effect of that disastrous ruling  as States have attempted to enact discriminatory voter ID laws and  other measures intended to prevent minority voters from going to the  polls. That is disgraceful, and we must do better. Congress must act to  ensure that millions of Americans are not disenfranchised.   The right to vote should not be a partisan issue. It is a right that  forms the basis of our democracy, and it is incumbent on all Americans,  Democratic and Republican, to ensure that no American's right to vote  is infringed. Modernizing our voter registration system is one  significant step forward.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DAINES (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Heller,          Mr. Hatch, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Isakson, and Mr.          Rubio):   S.J. Res. 46. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the  Constitution of the United States authorizing the Congress to prohibit  the physical desecration of the flag of the United States; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.
