 Mr. Speaker, this is purportedly an absolutely essential  extension of authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration to  continue to operate after October 1. Unfortunately, it has devolved  into other issues because it has turned into a Christmas tree on the  Republican side of the aisle.   We need to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. The last  time Congress failed to do this--and the ticket tax, which is what pays  for air traffic control in America, expired--almost every airline in  America raised their rates 7.5 percent, got a $400 million windfall,  which the government lost, with the exception of two: I understand,  Alaska and Spirit.   So if we fail to reauthorize, we can expect that that will happen  again.   Actually, their long-term plan is to privatize the FAA, do away with  the ticket tax, reap a $10 billion windfall, and then impose a new per- head fee to use our national airspace, which, by the way, Congress will  have nothing to say about that. No elected official will have any  authority over what new fees they charge. That is extraordinary.   That came out of the Republican side of the Ways and Means Committee.  What a bunch of losers. Come on. Give me a break. You are going to  allow the airlines to have the authority, a private corporation, to tax  people in America, and then say: Oh, it is not a tax; it is a user fee.   It sure feels like a tax to me, and it is going to feel like that to  your constituents. But when they complain, you will say: Oh, go talk to  the private corporation.   That is why we are here today, because the chairman of the committee  has stubbornly persisted in attempting to privatize the air traffic  organization of the United States of America, the most complex, the  most efficient, and the safest system in the world.   Yes, there are a few reforms that are needed there. Most of them have  to do with us. Congress sequesters their money. Even though there is  enough money raised in the ticket tax and other taxes to pay for the  system, we sequester their money, we shut them down. We do dumb things  like that.   So I introduced a bill to take care of those problems, to exempt them  from sequestration; to exempt them from budget shutdowns; and to  require reforms in their personnel procedures, their policy procedures  in terms of acquisitions; and to enhance the role of their coordinating  committee, which has been doing a great job coordinating between the  government and the airlines and all the people who use the system, not  just the commercial airlines; and authorize funds to rebuild some of  the major air traffic control centers, which are falling apart.   Instead, the chairman has insisted that we must privatize because  Canada did it, which is kind of a tiny fraction of what we are.   Then the airlines have this fake group called the Citizens for On  Time Flights, who say:         We have to fly zigzag routes, which are World War II radar.    No. Actually, we have deployed a system where you could fly all the  planes in America closer together with GPS, but the airlines haven't  bought the equipment, so they are blaming the FAA. That kind of stinks.  So that is why we are here today.   We have a bill that otherwise is totally agreed upon. If we were  voting today on an FAA bill to give them a 6-year extension without  privatization, with the reforms we need, we would be pressuring the  Senate to get something done.   Now, the Senate is hung up over whether or not you should have 1,500  hours of experience to sit in the copilot's seat. After the tragic  Colgan accident, reforms were adopted that made these requirements. So  they are hung up on that. On this side, we are hung up on privatizing  the system.   So it is sad that we have come to this point today. My hope is that  we will move forward soon in the bipartisan tradition of my committee,  and we will move an FAA bill and any amendments that are allowed, or  any riders or anything that is in it will have only to do with  aviation, not to do with flood insurance, not to do with any of all  these other miscellaneous things that are being thrown in here today.  We are here with the Ways and Means Committee on a bill that should be  a transportation bill.
