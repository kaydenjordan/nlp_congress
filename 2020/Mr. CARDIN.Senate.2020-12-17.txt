 Mr. President, I rise today to ask the Senate to  join me in recognizing my constituent and friend Cathy Hughes on the  40th anniversary of Urban One, Inc., formerly known as Radio One. Urban  One, headquartered in Montgomery County, MD, is America's largest  broadcast company primarily focused on African-American consumers. Over  the last four decades, it has elevated and celebrated African-American  voices while telling stories from their perspective. Today, Urban One  employs more than 1,500 people and reaches an estimated 82 percent of  African-Americans nationwide.   This remarkable success is attributable to the skillful and  passionate leadership of Cathy Hughes. Not long after Cathy started her  radio career in her hometown of Omaha, NE, she found herself lecturing  at Howard University's school of communications and serving as general  sales manager at the university's iconic radio station, WHUR. Cathy  started Radio One in 1980 with the purchase of her flagship station  WOL-AM in Washington, DC, and served as its morning show host for 11  years. As founder and chairwoman, Cathy has directed the successful  expansion of Radio One into new radio markets nationwide while  generating original content across the spectrum of radio, television,  and digital media. I am proud to note that Baltimore was the first city  into which Radio One expanded.   Urban One's remarkable 40 years of growth are all the more impressive  given the obstacles that Cathy has overcome, not least the racism and  sexism she has encountered during her groundbreaking career. In her  initial search for financing to buy the station that would become Radio  One, 32 banks rejected Cathy's bid.   Cathy has steered her company successfully through the changes and  challenges in media markets over the years, most recently navigating  the impact of COVID-19. While Radio One itself has been hurt by the  pandemic, she chose to support her community by providing free  advertising to Black-owned businesses.   Cathy's philanthropic work rivals her exceptional business  achievements. Of note is her passion for education, demonstrated by her  strong support of the Piney Woods School in Piney Woods, MS. This  school, which her grandfather established in 1909, currently serves as  the largest of four African-American boarding schools in the county.  Cathy has been recognized for extraordinary contributions many times  over the years: National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in  2019, the Woman of the Year Award by 100 Black Men of America in 2018,  the Ida B. Wells Living Legacy Award in 2011, and the Essence Women  Shaping the World Award in 2018. In 2019, Howard University named its  school of communications after her.   I ask the Senate to join me in recognizing the extraordinary career  of an extraordinary woman, Cathy Hughes, on the 40th anniversary of  Urban One.                            ____________________
