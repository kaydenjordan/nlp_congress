 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3192. I want to begin by  thanking the chairman of our committee, Mr. Walden, for giving us a  hearing on this bill and for moving the process forward. I thank the  gentleman along with Dr. Burgess; Ranking Member Pallone; Ranking  Member Green; and our cosponsor, Democratic colead Mrs. Napolitano as  well.   Mr. Speaker, a couple of decades ago, my uncle, Senator Edward  Kennedy, and Senator Orrin Hatch created the CHIP program because of a  consensus that children should never be caught in the midst of our  debates over healthcare. It has been a successful, bipartisan program  that has saved lived lives and has helped families facing their deepest  despair. But just like any program, Mr. Speaker, it has been a work in  progress.   This bill offers a simple fix to a troubling problem. According to  some estimates, nearly 500,000 children and pregnant mothers covered by  CHIP are not  [[Page H5233]]  guaranteed mental health care or substance use disorder treatment. We  have guaranteed that treatment for Americans covered by Medicaid,  private insurance, and employer-sponsored insurance. It is time we do  so for low-income families and babies as well.   In our efforts to confront an opioid epidemic that cares for no age,  no income, no race--nothing at all--this bill is a crucial piece of our  response.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank everyone at the  Legislative Counsel's Office, at CMS, and the staff on both sides of  the aisle from the Energy and Commerce Committee, and, in particular,  Rachel Pryor, for putting up with my relentless and sometimes misguided  questions.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I also endorse H.R. 4005, the Medicaid Reentry Act.   One particularly vulnerable population for overdose is individuals  reentering society post-incarceration. Incarcerated individuals, as my  colleague, Mr. Tonko, indicated, are far more likely to suffer from  substance use disorder. And without proper transition planning and  treatment, former inmates are at extremely high risk of dying from an  overdose after release. This legislation seeks to get at that problem.   Mr. Speaker, over the course of the hearings we have had on all of  these bills, there has not been a more dedicated, poignant, or powerful  speaker than Mr. Tonko. This is an issue that he cares passionately  about and that he has dedicated much of his time in Congress  addressing. He has put that effort into text in this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to adopt it, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise to voice my support for H.R. 5687, legislation authored by my  colleagues, Mr. Hudson and Mr. Butterfield, to provide the FDA with  authority to employ the use of packaging and disposal technologies to  help mitigate the risk of abuse and misuse of opioids.   As a part of FDA's efforts to help prevent misuse of opioids,  Commissioner Gottlieb has been actively exploring how packaging and  disposal innovations can deter abuse and reduce the supply of opioids  in the market.   This included hosting a public workshop in December to explore how we  can harness these technologies in the fight against opioid addiction  and how to improve the safety of these products for those patients who  rely on them to manage chronic pain every day.   Commissioner Gottlieb also noted, Mr. Speaker, that the use of these  technologies, such as packaging, merits consideration through a  careful, science-based process, one that I hope will continue.   The legislation we are considering today builds on this work and  grants FDA authority to require packaging and disposal technologies for  schedule II and schedule III controlled substances that reflect a level  of risk associated with that substance.   FDA is provided with the flexibility to permit a range of options for  packaging or disposal technologies, as long as such technologies  demonstrate comparable effectiveness. This flexibility will be crucial  to reduce barriers to generic entry, one of the concerns that was  raised during our committee consideration, and to maintain appropriate  patient access to these substances.   H.R. 5687 also clarifies that labeling related to the inclusion of  packaging or disposal technologies cannot be used as a blocking  strategy by brand manufacturers.   If enacted, it is my hope that the FDA will continue to work with  stakeholders, including manufacturers, to ensure that generic entry is  not impeded by the requirement of packaging or disposal technologies.  Both brand and generic manufacturers should be held to the same  performance outcome of mitigating risk and abuse; however, at a time of  rising drug costs, I believe manufacturers should be afforded enough  flexibility to pursue cost-effective technologies that will also meet  the shared goals of the FDA and patient community.   I also hope that any costs associated with the adoption of packaging  or disposal technologies will not be borne by the patients who rely on  these medications to manage their diseases or conditions.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Hudson and Mr. Butterfield for their  work on this issue as well as the FDA for their guidance through the  process.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5687, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5796, the REACH OUT Act.   This bill creates grants for technical assistance education for  outlier prescribers of opioids. The recipients of these grants, Mr.  Speaker, will educate outlier prescribers on best practices for  prescribing opioids and provide instruction on how to reduce the number  of opioids prescribed in the future.   Coupled with legislation we will also consider today that would  require notification of outlier prescribers of  [[Page H5239]]  opioids, this bill will further provide outlier prescribers with the  tools to return to the appropriate prescribing range for their  specialty to help reduce overprescribing.   Mr. Speaker, I have to say that we have just been informed that there  will be a last-minute change to two of the suspension prints under  consideration today in order to accommodate a request from the  Appropriations Committee.   The minority only received notice of these changes within the last  hour. While they appear to be changes that are technical in nature to  address the jurisdictional issues, we want to highlight our concerns  with the last-minute changes being made to legislative text that are  being considered on the floor with such short notice. It is not the  best way to legislate, especially on bipartisan bills on such an  important topic.   My colleagues and I have expressed some concern about this process,  and this latest issue reinforces those concerns. We urge the Speaker to  commit to continuing to work with us on a bipartisan basis to avoid  some of these changes in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill. I hope the House will support it as  well, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz), my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I think Dr. Ruiz has done an extraordinary  job on this legislation. I would urge the House to support it, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5811, the Long-Term Opioid  Efficacy Act of 2018, authored by Representatives McNerney and  Griffith.   Despite the prevalent use of opioids today in combating pain, the  long-term  [[Page H5244]]  impacts of opioids and whether or not they are truly the most effective  treatment is still fairly unknown.   FDA Commissioner Gottlieb testified before the Energy and Commerce  Committee that many opioids have not been studied for chronic  administration and further studying could help address certain  questions. This includes the long-term efficacy of opioids and whether  opioids may contribute to increased addictive tendencies over time.   This legislation would help us better understand the long-term  impacts of opioids and whether opioids truly are the most effective  treatment for chronic pain management by allowing the FDA to require  manufacturers of controlled substances, such as opioids, to conduct  post-market studies to assess the effectiveness of these products and  whether or not they pose an increase in serious risk.                                time  1515    Under current law, the FDA has the authority to request postmarket  studies relating to the safety considerations of a drug, but it does  not have explicit authority to do so related to the efficacy of a drug.  It is our hope that, by granting this authority to the FDA, we will  better understand the long-term impacts of opioids that are chronically  administered and encourage more responsible prescribing of opioids  moving forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the gentleman from Rhode  Island for all of his work and dedication on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to support the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on H.R. 5801, the Medicaid PARTNERSHIP  Act.   This legislation requires Medicaid providers to have a program that  requires providers to check a qualified prescription drug monitoring  program, a PDMP, before prescribing a schedule II controlled substance  and encourages integration of the PDMP into a provider's clinical work  flow.   Today, Mr. Speaker, more than 30 States have some form of mandated  provider PDMP check. This legislation would require all Medicaid  programs to have such a policy in place.   Integrating PDMPs with Medicaid is a critical tool in this crisis for  our providers to be able to prevent opioid addiction.   Research has demonstrated that these types of mandates can encourage  registration and use of a State's PDMP by providers. That is why I  support investing in our PDMPs so that they are good realtime systems  that our providers can actually check easily.   Importantly, this legislation preserves the ability of States to work  with providers to design a mandate that best meets the needs of all  involved.   State flexibility and proper financing of our PDMPs is critical to  achieving the intent of this legislation, which, if enacted, I will  closely monitor going forward.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5590 sponsored by  Representatives Kinzinger and Clarke. I commend my colleagues for their  hard work on this legislation.   We know that there is more that the Department of Health and Human  Services needs to do to address the opioid crisis. We know that we need  to do more not only to bring down opioid prescribing, but to expand  access to medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders.   H.R. 5590 would direct the Secretary of HHS to examine potential  obstacles to an effective response to the opioid crisis and issue  recommendations for addressing them. It directs the Secretary to look  at barriers to both wider use of nonopioid alternatives to manage pain,  as well as therapies that treat opioid addiction.   Mr. Speaker, while this is an important bill, I want to underscore  that it is incremental.   I also want to reiterate my continuing concern that while Democrats  support working on a legislative package to address the opioid crisis,  as we have over the course of the day-to-day and over the course of the  past several weeks with our Republican colleagues, we must also assure  that we first do no harm.   The Trump administration and Republican efforts to dismantle the  Affordable Care Act would do serious harm to our healthcare system and  to individuals suffering from opioid use disorders specifically.   For instance, the Trump administration continues to undermine the  individual market by promoting junk insurance plans, such as short- term, limited duration health plans.   These plans would allow insurers to once again exclude individuals  with preexisting conditions, such as opioid use disorder, and charge  individuals more based on their health status. It would make coverage  for individuals who need comprehensive health coverage, such as  individuals with opioid use disorders, less affordable and accessible.   Moreover, apparently Republicans are not done with their efforts to  repeal the ACA. Despite public backlash to repeal efforts last year and  despite statements today expressing concern about the opioid crisis,  news reports indicate that Republicans are once again planning to make  another effort to try to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   The opioids package cannot be considered in a vacuum. Ongoing efforts  to sabotage and repeal the ACA will not only reverse the gains that we  make from these efforts today, but will inflict lasting harm to our  healthcare system and our ability to fight the opioid crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
