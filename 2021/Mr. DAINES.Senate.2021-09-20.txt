 Mr. President, I have the honor of recognizing  Bill Dutcher, general manager of MetraPark, for his 40 years of service  to the Billings community as he prepares to retire at the end of the  year.   Before stepping into the role of general manager, Bill served in a  variety of other roles from part time work at the fairgrounds, to  maintenance, as well as operations management at MetraPark. Not only  has Bill met Presidents and rock stars while on the job, but he has  also bedded every horse stall and washed more than 10,000 arena seats.  No matter what the job is, Bill always brings the same level of  enthusiasm to the task at hand.   Though Bill will be missed by more than 150 MetraPark employees, he  will not be a stranger once he retires. There are many upcoming events  he looks forward to attending, which will be easily accomplished as the  Yellowstone County commissioners presented him with a lifetime pass to  every future MetraPark event. Bill has truly created a legacy of  customer service within this organization that will be remembered for  decades to come.   It is my distinct honor to recognize Bill for his 40 years of service  to the people of the Billings community. I have no doubt Bill will find  new ways to bring people joy as he enters into this new chapter of life  and enjoys time with his wife and two children.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have the honor of recognizing  Hunter Jones of Billings for his many years supporting Montana service  members deployed overseas.   Hunter is the grandson of a World War I veteran, and the son of a  World War II and Korean War veteran. Though not a veteran himself,  Hunter was instilled with a driving passion to honor military  servicemembers throughout his life. Hunter made his way to Billings,  MT, as an educator in 1995 and quickly began a program with his  students at Will James Middle School to recognize and honor Montana  servicemembers and veterans.   Following the tragic terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11,  2001, Hunter saw the need to support Montanans deployed overseas in the  Global War on Terror. He and his students began sending care packages  and letters to the men and women fighting to protect our freedoms. For  over 19 years, Hunter has diligently kept this up, and now, close to 30  of his former students have been inspired to military service,  including a Navy SEAL and members of all military branches, who have  also received care packages from him. Military servicemembers have  recognized Hunter's support by sending him American flags flown in  countries where they were deployed, along with letters of appreciation.  Hunter proudly displays them in his classroom.   It is my distinct honor to recognize Hunter for over 20 years of  supporting Montana military servicemembers and for teaching the  Treasure State's youth to honor those who have fought for this great  Nation. Hunter's patriotism and love for the men and women of our Armed  Forces will live on in the generations of Montanans he has taught at  Will James Middle School in Billings, MT.                            ____________________
