 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  time and for his leadership on programs that protect and address the  needs of vulnerable children here at home and around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to be the author of this bipartisan  resolution, along with Congressman   Joe Wilson. And I am very proud of  the 62 bipartisan cosponsors on this bill who represent the geographic  and ideological diversity of this House.   I also thank the broad coalition of organizations that have worked so  long in support of this resolution, in particular, ChildFund, Save the  Children, World Vision, Futures Without Violence, and UNICEF USA.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter supporting this  resolution from these groups and others.                                                   January 31, 2020.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House, U.S. House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Steny Hoyer,      Majority Leader, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, and Minority       Leader McCarthy: As organizations committed to the protection       and health of children around the globe, we kindly request       that the House of Representatives approve on suspension of       the rules H. Res. 230, a Congressional Resolution to End       Violence Against Children Globally. Our community is proud of       the strong bipartisan support that H. Res. 230 has received       in Congress since it was introduced by Congressman Jim       McGovern (D-MA) and Congressman Joe Wilson (R-SC) on March       14, 2019. It is currently cosponsored by a bipartisan group       of more than 60 Members of Congress and was previously       approved by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on October       30, 2019.        Half of all children--one billion--are victims of violence       each year and every five minutes, a child dies as a result.       Forms of violence include, but are not limited to, human       trafficking, child marriage, child labor, homicide, and       online exploitation and sexual abuse. Early exposure to       violence can impair children's brain development and damage       their circulatory, reproductive, and immune systems, causing       life-long risk of disease and reduced potential. The global       economic cost of violence against children has been measured       to be as high as $7 trillion dollars or 8% of the world's GDP       annually.        Fortunately, the United States Government is uniquely       positioned to drive efforts to prevent and respond to       violence against children. Federal government agencies like       USAID, the State Department and the Department of Labor are       already hard at work serving the world's children. However,       these efforts are done without optimal coordination between       agencies or an overarching, government-wide strategy.  [[Page H1456]]         The Congressional Resolution to End Violence Against       Children Globally (H. Res. 230/S. Res. 112) recognizes the       harmful impacts of violence and calls upon Congress to       develop and implement a coordinated strategy based on proven       practices. The resolution highlights the INSPIRE framework--      seven key evidence-based strategies to end violence against       children. INSPIRE, developed in collaboration with the CDC,       USAID, and others, provides common metrics and indicators       which can measure and monitor progress.        Over the years, the U.S. Government has demonstrated its       commitment to the health and well-being of children.       Providing safety and security for vulnerable children       supports U.S. efforts to address violence and mitigate its       impacts, therein bolstering other anti-poverty international       development efforts, including education, health, and       economic well-being. Building upon the work of the U.S.       Government's Strategy on Advancing Protection and Care for       Children in Adversity, passage of H. Res. 230 would enhance       existing government efforts to address pervasive violence       against children.        We thank you in advance for your consideration of H. Res.       230. We urge you to support these one billion children and       support passage of this important resolution.            Sincerely,        American Academy of Pediatrics, ChildFund International,       Futures Without Violence, Save the Children, UNICEF USA,       World Vision, Bethany Christian Services, Elizabeth Glaser       Pediatric AIDS Foundation, Feed the Children, Food for the       Hungry, Global Campaign for Education-US,       GlobalPartnersUnited, Islamic Relief USA, RESULTS, RISE       Institute, SPOON Foundation.     Mr. Speaker, even though we have made great strides in  identifying and addressing much of the violence that affects children  and young people around the world, the sad reality is that violence  against children is still pandemic.   Every 5 minutes, a child dies of violence. Half of all children--1  billion--are victims of violence. Homicide is among the top causes of  death in adolescents.   That is not just a shame, Mr. Speaker. That is absolutely  unacceptable.   Mr. Speaker, 80 percent of those homicide victims are boys, and  nearly one in five girls is sexually abused at least once in her life.   Mr. Speaker, sadly, violence can happen anywhere--in communities, in  schools, in the home, in emergency and crisis situations, in churches,  on the streets, online, and on the phone. It happens in the most  idyllic-seeming neighborhood and in the midst of conflict and war.   Violence takes many forms: human trafficking, child marriage, child  labor, murder, assault, beatings, psychological abuse, and online  exploitation. And too much of the violence is based on gender.   We know that children who are exposed to violence at a very young age  can be affected for life. Violence can impair brain development. It  could damage the circulatory and immune systems.   Such violence can cause lifelong risks of being vulnerable to  disease, illness, and disabilities. It can harm the ability to  reproduce and engage in a full sexual life. It can severely affect the  ability of a child to live up to their full potential.   Luckily, nations, healthcare providers, teachers, communities, and  nongovernmental groups have come together to end violence against  children. They have identified and agreed upon some solutions to ending  violence against children.   We in this House should be proud that the CDC, USAID, World Health  Organization, and others have developed what is called the INSPIRE  package, which is a set of strategies to reduce and end violence  against children everywhere.   So many of us in this Chamber are parents. I am the father of a son  and a daughter. I know how we worry about our children's safety and  well-being. This is true of all families everywhere. In many ways, each  and every child is our child. We need to be concerned about their  vulnerability, about their safety, about their care, and about their  protection.   This resolution announces to the world that we are aware; that we do  care; and, more importantly, that we want our health and aid agencies  to take action.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution,  and I thank my colleagues for their support.
