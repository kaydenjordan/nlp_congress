 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor one  of Dubuque, Iowa's most respected citizens and a fixture in the  community, Mayor Roy Buol.   Serving 10 years on the city council and 16 years as mayor, Roy  dedicated the last 26 years to shaping the vibrant community of  Dubuque.   Roy's leadership and his contributions transformed Dubuque into the  ``Masterpiece of the Mississippi'' and have allowed this community to  flourish.   Dubuque truly is a great place to live, work, and raise a family.   Mayor Buol's service to Dubuque is a reminder that effective  leadership begins with understanding the community and is best carried  out through partnerships and collaboration.   I know I speak for many when I say thank you, Mayor Buol, for your  service.                            ____________________
