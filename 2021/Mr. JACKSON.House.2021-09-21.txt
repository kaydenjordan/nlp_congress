 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of one of the most  important bills that comes before Congress, the NDAA. This year's NDAA  follows the National Defense Strategy by modernizing our military,  providing a pay raise for servicemembers, and restoring readiness.   This legislation will modernize our nuclear triad, supporting the  work done at the Pantex plant in Amarillo.   The NDAA also includes provisions that will support Sheppard Air  Force Base by funding the new fighter trainer and authorizing military  construction for a new child development center.   Also included are countless provisions I authored that put  servicemembers first and ensure the safety of all soldiers, airmen,  marines, and guardians.   The NDAA continues efforts on the Future Vertical Lift to make sure  we have a rotary aircraft that can operate in future conflicts with  China or Russia.   As we consider amendments, I hope that this bill remains focused on  national security and can be passed in a good-faith manner as we did  almost unanimously in committee.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers for  their leadership in putting together a bipartisan defense bill.
