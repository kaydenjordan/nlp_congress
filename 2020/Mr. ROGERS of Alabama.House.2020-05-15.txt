 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from  Oklahoma for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H. Res. 965. This  blatant, partisan move to fundamentally alter the way the House and  committees operate completely undermines the rights of the minority and  over 200 years of precedent.   As ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am  particularly concerned how this resolution overrides the rules of our  committee. At the beginning of the Congress our committee negotiated  with the majority a set of rules that protected minority rights. Now  those rules are being thrown out and replaced by regulations written by  the chairman of the Rules Committee, regulations that the minority  first saw only hours ago.   I don't understand why Speaker Pelosi doesn't trust her chairmen and  chairwomen to negotiate with their ranking members on ways to  accommodate committee business during this pandemic. But, apparently,  she just doesn't trust them.   One of the things that concerns me most about this resolution is that  nothing guarantees that Republican Members are going to properly be  notified and able to fully participate in virtual committee hearings.  That may sound petty to you, but, unfortunately, on my committee, it is  already the reality. For the last 2 weeks, Homeland Security Democrats  have been holding virtual hearings without notifying Republican  Members. To make matters worse, they restricted participation to only a  handful of their Members. I fear this resolution will only further  empower the misconduct on my committee and cause it to spread to  others.   Worst of all, this is being done for the short-term benefit of the  majority, and not the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from all ranking  members opposing this resolution.                                                  Washington, DC,                                                       May 14, 2020.      Hon. Steny H. Hoyer,      Majority Leader of the House,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader Hoyer: We write in regards to H. Res.       965, which proposes partisan changes that facilitate remote       and virtual committee operations while the House remains in       recess.  [[Page H2037]]         When the Majority first released proposed rule changes a       few weeks ago, we couldn't possibly imagine it could get any       worse for the House as an institution. Yet, somehow, the       Majority managed to write an even more egregious package of       rules changes and seems hellbent on pushing these changes       through without bipartisan consensus.        Upending more than 200 years of precedent through partisan       fiat will jeopardize the deliberative process of the House of       Representatives and our ability to represent our       constituents. The House will be in session this week with       debate being held and votes being cast. If the whole House       can conduct business while adhering to health guidelines,       then so too can our Committees.        The work of committees should be prioritized to ensure that       we are producing thoughtful legislation to support the       continuing response to COVID-19 and to foster a robust       economic recovery for the American people. Properly       prioritizing this work will ensure greater flexibility in       scheduling and increase our ability to follow all applicable       health guidelines.        Congress has already demonstrated that we can come together       during this crisis to address the needs of the American       people. Unfortunately, many of the proposed changes in H.       Res. 965 are only necessary if you seek to move partisan       measures or legislation un-related to the COVID-19 response.        The proposed resolution gives unilateral authority to       Chairman McGovern to determine how committees manage their       business. Currently, committees are required to vote to       ratify proposed committee rules, but this new superpower will       allow a single Member of the House to determine the rules of       the road for all without amendments and without a vote.        The issuance of a subpoena and conducting a deposition are       serious matters. To allow remote depositions underscores how       unserious H. Res. 965 truly is. A deposition is an important       tool for committees to use and it should not be subject to       the uncontrolled environment of an untested virtual setting.        The rights of the Minority in the House must be protected.       Without the ability to ensure the rights of our Members are       secured, we cannot support your efforts and will oppose any       attempt to alter the rules.        As Ranking Members of all standing and select committees,       we oppose this partisan assault on the rights of the House       Minority and our ability to effectively represent the       American people.            Sincerely,          Michael Conaway, Ranking Member, House Committee on             Agriculture; Mac Thornberry, Ranking Member, House             Committee on Armed Services; Virginia Foxx, Ranking             Member, House Committee on Education and Labor; Kenny             Marchant, Ranking Member, House Committee on Ethics;             Michael McCaul, Ranking Member, House Committee on             Foreign Affairs; Rodney Davis, Ranking Member,             Committee on House Administration; Kay Granger, Ranking             Member, House Committee on Appropriations; Steve             Womack, Ranking Member, House Committee on the Budget;             Greg Walden, Ranking Member, House Committee on Energy             and Commerce; Patrick McHenry, Ranking Member, House             Committee on Financial Services; Mike Rogers, Ranking             Member, House Committee on Homeland Security.          Jim Jordan, Ranking Member, House Committee on Judiciary,             House Committee on Oversight and Reform; Rob Bishop,             Ranking Member, House Committee on Natural Resources;             Frank Lucas, Ranking Member, House Committee on             Science, Space and Technology; Sam Graves, Ranking             Member, House Committee on Transportation and             Infrastructure; Kevin Brady, Republican Leader,             Committee on Ways & Means; Garret Graves, Ranking             Member, Select Committee on the Climate Crisis; Tom             Cole, Ranking Member, House Committee on Rules; Steve             Chabot, Ranking Member, House Committee on Small             Business; Phil Roe, Ranking Member, House Committee on             Veterans' Affairs; Devin Nunes, Ranking Member,             Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence; Tom Graves,             Ranking Member, Select Committee on the Modernization             of Congress.     Mr. Speaker, many of my constituents are  showing up to work every day; from grocery store clerks, to nurses,  doctors, policemen, and first responders. If the House had the resolve  and the courage to do the same, we wouldn't need this partisan  resolution. This is disgraceful. I urge all Members to vote ``no.''
