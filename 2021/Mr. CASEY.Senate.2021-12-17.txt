 Mr. President, as this year draws to a close, I rise today  to recognize my staff and their exemplary service to Pennsylvania in  the face of immense challenges. Even under the best of circumstances,  public service can be challenging work. For the past 2 years my staff  have, like all Americans, grappled with the daunting uncertainty and  isolation wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic and grief for the more than  800,000 lives lost.   Despite these difficulties, they have risen to the demands of the  moment to support, advocate for, and empower the people of  Pennsylvania. The end of the year is a time for reflection on all that  we have overcome and an opportunity to express gratitude for those we  hold dear. This December, I would like to express my gratitude for the  men and women who have served in my office--some of whom have since  moved on--and their indelible contributions to the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania during such an extraordinary time.   I am grateful for my administrative staff, who build and maintain the  solid foundation on which an effective congressional office is built.  These are the people who tirelessly ensure that everyone on our team  has the support and resources needed to do their jobs effectively.  While the work that they do may not be noticeable to everyone, they are  truly the connective tissue which allows the rest of the office to  function.   Similarly, the office's executive staff are tasked with ensuring my  time is used as efficiently as possible and that my day runs smoothly.  From building schedules that balance constituent engagements, committee  hearings, floor votes, and travel; to managing the flurry of briefing  memos on any given day and drafting my constituent greetings, I could  not be nearly as effective on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania  without their hard work.   It is impossible to overstate the importance of the work of the  constituent services team, who walk with constituents in their darkest  moments in pursuit of a brighter resolution. Day in and day out, these  are the men and women who help Pennsylvania seniors navigate issues  with Social Security checks, help veterans secure benefits owed to them  and medals they have earned, among so many other things. During COVID,  they have continued to assist with routine cases while also working  tirelessly to connect Pennsylvanians with testing and other resources,  apply for small business relief, navigate unemployment systems, and so  much more.   The outreach staff, spread out over seven offices across the  Commonwealth, serve as a vital resource in ensuring the needs of all 67  counties are met. These individuals are my liaisons to local  communities across Pennsylvania, representing me in their regions every  single day. Throughout the pandemic, they have been in constant contact  with local elected officials, sharing information back and forth and  bringing to bear Federal resources when they have been needed most.  Their relationships across the Commonwealth, and their granular  knowledge of communities large and small are extraordinary. I am  grateful for innumerable phone calls and meetings that they lead and  attend every year and the thousands of miles that they drive as they  crisscross their regions to show up for the communities they represent.   The legislative staff fight daily for policies that will improve life  for every American, but especially those who are too often overlooked  and left behind. These men and women bring their expertise to bear to  help inform my policy positions and floor votes. In answering  constituent correspondence, they parse through complex matters of  policy to help constituents better understand how critical legislation  will impact Pennsylvania. I am deeply grateful for the benefit of their  extraordinary minds and their dedication to improving the lives of  working families with sound policy.   It is through the tireless work of the communications staff that  Pennsylvanians understand how I am representing them in Washington.  These men and women are a vital bridge between the work that I do in  the Senate and the people of Pennsylvania, helping me connect the  voices of the Commonwealth to the halls of Congress, and in turn  bringing our legislative work back into communities across  Pennsylvania.   Since 2017, I have had the privilege of serving as the lead Democrat  on the Senate Special Committee on Aging. During the pandemic, this  team has relentlessly demanded accountability from the programs and  institutions that serve older adults and people with disabilities. As  COVID devastated nursing homes, they pushed for increased transparency  to protect residents and workers. They now lead the call for  transformative investments in life-changing home and community-based  services.   There is an inscription on the Finance Building in Harrisburg, PA,  that has guided me during my time as a public official. It reads: ``All  public service is a trust, given in faith and accepted in honor.'' Each  and every day, my staff demonstrate their commitment to that trust with  tireless work and personal sacrifice. They are hard-working and  talented individuals who form a distinguished collective of honorable  public servants whom I respect and whom I am grateful to work  alongside.   Today, I am proud to list them alphabetically by name to memorialize  their service to our Commonwealth and our country during this pandemic:         Tad Abramowich        Natalie Adams        Sandra Aguilera Garcia        Jennifer Baker        Jordan Ball        Rob Bielunas        Kim Bierly        Hulan Bikales        Regina Brennan        Sydney Brooks        Jessica Butherus        Kathi Caber        Jenna Carmen        Alyssa Charney        McKenzie Cliatt        Christian Clesi        Bob Coomber        Connor Corpora        Rory Daly        Stephanie DeLuca        Teresa Dennis        Josh Dubensky        Thomas Eagen        Micah Escobedo        Erika Felix        Marlon Ferguson        Lara Flynn        Adam Fountaine        Michael Gamel-McCormick        Peter Gartrell        Kristen Gentile        Ben Gilsdorf        Jasmine Goodman        Veronica Goodman        Ian Graham        Rashage Green        Jack Groarke        Andrea Guscott        Kyle Hannon        Hans Hansen        Kristen Harfield        Doug Hartman        Corey Husak        Sean Hyland  [[Page S9302]]         Maurya Incavido        Narda Ipakchi        Brian Jennings        Aisha Johnson        Christopher Johnson        Robert Joyce        Liz Kishbaugh        Samantha Koehler        Molly Krafcik        Josh Kramer        Trace Ledgard        James Lee        Jose Leoncio        Nefetia Lundy        Mairead Lynn        Ian Madigan        Kristin Magnotta        Shoshana Marin        Ben Martin        Lindsay Martin        Sara Maskornick        Robbie Matesic        Cindy Matos Beltre        Jae'Von McClain        Jake Medvitz        Alina Meltaus        Carolyn Mendez-Luck        Leah Mercik        Datnilza Metz        Kate Mevis        Derek Miller        Keith Miller        Gillian Mueller        Janet Murphy        Grace Nelson        Paul Nestler        Stephen O'Brion        Kennedy O'Dell        Max Olender        Hector Ortiz        Panini Pandya        Reecha Patel        Isabel Perez        Joycelyn Pickens        Nikki Rai        John Rizzo        Rahmon Ross        Ryan Ross        Kate Samuelson        Stacy Sanders        Valli Sanmugalingam        Judy Schaechter        Abigail Seibert        Julia Sferlazzo        Zach Shaw        Livia Shmavonian        Sara-Paige Silvestro        Madison Sloat        Allegra Smith        Cam Thompson        Amanda Toth        Jenna Valle-Riestra        Lieke van Heumen        Landy Wade        Caitlin Warner        Tia Watson        Aimee Wechsler        Ebony Staton Weidman        Madison West        Wesley Whistle                            ____________________
