 Mr. President, first of all, let me thank my colleague  from North Dakota for making this presentation to begin with and my  colleague from North Carolina for supporting him in this action. We  appreciate the comments the Senator from Maryland has made, but we,  most certainly, disagree with the approach he is suggesting.   Senator Cramer has suggested that we have a very serious problem here  that has to be addressed. This is something that does not affect just  Republican businesses. It affects all businesses. You are talking about  4.2 million small businesses across the United States that are being  impacted by this that have borrowed money in good faith and that have  kept their businesses open. Now, surprisingly, when it comes time for  the forgiveness portion of this to occur, we have a very challenging  process put in place--a burdensome process--that could only have been  done with the common sense found in Washington, DC, not in the rest of  the country. To make the application more difficult for one to get  forgiveness than the actual application to participate in the program  in the first place is simply absurd.   Let me share with you a message from one of our bank executives in  South Dakota. He is a rather prominent CEO in South Dakota. I share  with you that I have cleaned this up a little bit and will paraphrase  his quote to us after we asked him for information concerning how the  banks will try to handle this.  [[Page S5911]]    Remember, the banks didn't have to participate in this, but they did  so, in a way, to literally get money out in a very short period of time  to the businesses that desperately needed the money in order to  survive.   First of all, they had open lines of communication with the SBA  literally 24/7 for more than a week in their trying to get approval for  individual applications. They helped small businesses actually fill out  the applications in the first place. Second of all, these banks will  become responsible for these loans, and unless they are forgiven, they  will stay with the banks.   If we are successful in coming to an agreement on additional loans  being made in the future, how in the world can we expect these banks to  get back in if we can't even follow up on our agreement that we would  make this a simple process to get the loans forgiven in the first  tranche that we have completed?   Let me share with you what this CEO writes. This has to do with his  version of what is going on. We have literally received dozens of these  types of comments from bank loan officers in the Upper Midwest,  particularly in South Dakota. I will paraphrase because, as I say, we  had to clean this up a little bit.         The forgiveness piece of the PPP is a disaster. I have 750       loans out of 1,381 that are under $20,000 and 50 that are       under $2,000. They have, basically, the same forgiveness       process as the loans of my largest borrower, which is for       over $4 million. So we are asking them to fill out the same       paperwork as we do a large loan recipient.    He goes on to write:         The simplified version of the PPP loan forgiveness       application program is not that simple. The Government       Accountability Office has studied it and has said that it       takes a borrower 15 hours to complete and the lender 75 hours       to process.    Let me say that again. It takes 15 hours for the loan borrower to  actually do the paperwork and 75 hours to process it.         Our borrowers are not happy nor are we as bankers. This is       not what we signed up for in order to get disaster payments       to our customers. We are trying to hold off the small       businesses that borrowed under $150,000, but they are getting       anxious. We as lenders busted our tails to get this money       out, and we are getting absolutely hosed by this process.    I might add that this is not the word he used.         Lenders feel as though they have really been let down.       There is more than a little fatigue with the entire PPP loan       forgiveness process.    If we used any kind of common sense like they have in the Upper  Midwest, we would have fixed this thing already. Unfortunately, it is  in the middle of a political process in Washington, DC, and 4.2 million  small businesses hang in the balance. Their ability to take care of a  loan--that we had committed would be forgiven if they were to follow  through--is now in jeopardy. Time is running out.   I appreciate the opportunity, once again, to support the legislation  that Senator Cramer from North Dakota has proposed. I hope that our  colleagues on both sides of the aisle will come back and start using  some of that common sense that seems to prevail in the rest of the  United States even though it is not always evident here in Washington,  DC.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
