 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for bringing S.J. Res. 57  to the floor today, a joint resolution to disapprove the 2013 Bureau  guidance on auto finance. It has been well discussed today, why that  is.   This is a very tailored, commonsense approach. It does not open up a  precedent towards guidance being used for a CRA. It is a very narrow  joint resolution. It is designed particularly with the GAO's ruling  from last December, so I don't think that hyperbole is necessary.   We are here today to make sure that all of our constituents have  access to affordable auto credit. Black, White, female, male, they need  affordable auto credit. How do we get a job if we don't have an  affordable car with which to go to work? So that is why we are here.   Secondly, we are here because our constituents demand that we demand  accountability in our oversight function, we demand transparency. When  you have a process that was not transparent and did not follow the  Administrative Procedures Act and did not follow the statute, we don't  have accountability and we don't have transparency. Our constituents  argue for that.   Many argue laws should be based on sound data; our rules should be  carefully debated in public. That was not done in this instance. So we  have this surreptitious, specious display of sophistry known as the  indirect auto guidance from the Bureau.   So we are correcting that today, and the beneficiaries will be our  constituents. The beneficiaries will be Article I power in this House  as we oversee the executive.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for bringing this bill to the  floor, and I thank Mr. Zeldin for his leadership.
