 Mr. President, we have been talking all week about the  ways our historic tax reform law is immediately helping middle-class  families. It has been less than a month since Congress passed and the  President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but already more than 1  million Americans are on track to receive special bonuses, permanent  raises, and other benefits, and their employers are attributing these  changes directly to tax reform.   In fact, 100,000 employees of American Airlines are each receiving a  $1,000 tax reform bonus; U.S. Bank is raising its minimum wage to $15  and is also giving $1,000 bonuses to 60,000 employees; 29,000 employees  of Nationwide Insurance are also receiving bonuses, and 33,000 are  getting an increase in their retirement match. These are just a few of  the 100-plus companies that have already announced new benefits for  American workers as a direct result of tax reform. These are only the  immediate benefits.   Mainstream economists agree that in the months and years to come, the  permanent changes we made in the way we tax businesses will make our  economy more vibrant and more competitive. That means greater  investment and higher wages for American workers. Of course, all this  is in addition to the direct effects the tax cuts themselves will soon  have on family budgets.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will reduce income tax rates and  significantly expand key deductions. We took money out of Washington  and put it right back in the pockets of middle-class Americans.  Starting as early as February, the IRS will withhold less from  paychecks, and workers will get to deposit more of their hard-earned  money right into their own bank accounts. In 2018 alone, for a typical  family of four earning just over 70,000, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  could mean a tax savings of more than $2,000.   Nearly every day, reports come out about a new way this historic tax  reform bill is helping Americans. Here is a subject that is  particularly relevant around many kitchen tables this winter: utility  bills. All around the country, utility companies that will benefit from  our new tax cuts are already discussing plans to pass their savings on  to customers.  [[Page S114]]    Major power companies in Illinois, Maryland, and Massachusetts are  already proposing plans to give their customers tens of millions of  dollars in relief by lowering the rates they charge for energy. And get  this: According to CNBC, a South Carolina electric and gas utility is  planning to give a cash payment directly to its customers, averaging  $1,000 per household. More are following suit. In Montana, Louisiana,  and Indiana, regulators are already working with utilities to determine  how households will benefit from the tax savings. In my own State of  Kentucky, the Public Service Commission directed a number of the  electric, gas, and water companies to track their savings and make  plans to cut rates for consumers.   As any mother or father who has to balance a checkbook and pay bills  every month can attest, this is welcome news for middle-class families.  These reductions will be especially helpful to the most vulnerable in  our society.   According to data from the Department of Health and Human Services,  energy costs eat up a significantly higher percentage of household  income for poor families than for other families. In other words, for a  software engineer in Silicon Valley, a lower heating or air  conditioning bill may go unnoticed, but for workers who clean that  office overnight, this relief will make a real difference.   A drop in utility bills effectively amounts to progressive tax  relief. This is just another example of how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  is rapidly proving to be a serious asset to poor and middle-class  families--precisely the people whom my Democratic friends in the House  and Senate loudly claimed would get nothing at all from this bill.   It has been 3 weeks--3 weeks--lower utility bills, 1 million special  tax reform bonuses and pay raises, and this is only the beginning.   A Republican majority in the House and a Republican majority in the  Senate and President Trump listened to the facts instead of the  political spin. I am proud that we passed this historic bill and gave  families across America the tax relief they have waited decades to  receive.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 12 noon  tomorrow, all postcloture time on the Brown nomination be considered  expired and the Senate vote on confirmation of the Brown nomination  with no intervening action or debate; further, that if cloture is  invoked on the Counts nomination, all postcloture time be considered  expired at 1:45 p.m. tomorrow and the Senate vote on confirmation of  the Counts nomination with no intervening action or debate; finally,  that if confirmed, the motions to reconsider with respect to the Brown  and Counts nominations be considered made and laid upon the table and  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 282, S. 875.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  committee-reported substitute amendment be agreed to, the bill, as  amended, be considered read a third time and passed, and the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. on  Thursday, January 11; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; finally, that  following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and  resume consideration of the Brown nomination.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:42 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, January 11, 2018, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
