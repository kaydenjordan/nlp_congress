 Mr. President, I rise today to honor a true  inspiration from my home State of Idaho, Margaret St. Clair Plastino.  Likely the oldest living registered nurse in Idaho, Margaret has truly  used her 102 years on this earth to improve the health of those in her  community. Because of this lifetime of service, she is being honored on  Monday, November 4, 2019, by her fellow nurses at the Idaho Nurses  Recognition Dinner cosponsored by the Idaho Center for Nursing, Nurse  Leaders of Idaho, and the American Nurses Association of Idaho. This is  a well-deserved honor, as Margaret spent the majority of her life  improving healthcare in Idaho.   Margaret was born in Utah in 1917 to Edwin St. Clair and Evelyn  Borrow before she and her family moved to Shelley, ID. She has remained  in eastern Idaho ever since, helping her community and serving as a  positive influence in the lives of those she encounters. Margaret  graduated from the Idaho Falls LDS Hospital School of Nursing in 1939  and was hired by Bonneville County as county nurse in 1942. Beginning  her career during the Great Depression, Margaret not only provided much  needed medical care, she also provided emotional support and comfort to  patients. She treated each patient with the devotion and care that were  central to her character.   Margaret married her husband, Ben Plastino, in 1948, and they were  blessed with three daughters. She began a new full-time role raising  their family in 1952. Although she was no longer spending her days  caring for patients as a full-time nurse, Margaret continued to help  provide healthcare to the community where she could, including  administering important vaccines. She eventually returned to the  nursing profession, becoming the first home health nurse in  southeastern Idaho. After she retired, she maintained active in the  field and volunteered in various roles for the next 25 years.   There are countless stories that illustrate Margaret's devotion as a  nurse. Many of these have been shared in local and State newspapers  recently and there are certainly more to be shared amongst her friends,  family, and community. Such instances include Margaret's decision to  administer tetanus shots to those affected by the Teton Dam collapse in  1976. She also cared for children of a struggling family when she found  out they did not have sufficient food in their household. It is  heartening to hear stories such as these and I hope they will continue  to spread and inspire more individuals to do as Margaret has.   Margaret went the extra mile in all that she did to ensure the best  care was administered to her community. She did not do this for  accolades or attention. She recognized that she could be of service to  her community and wanted to use her skill sets to help. She has  demonstrated the love she has for her community and demonstrated how to  treat each patient in a manner that reflects their dignity as a person.  Margaret is selfless and the type of individual who makes her community  and Idaho such a special place. There is no one more deserving to be  honored.   Today, I express appreciation on behalf of countless individuals from  the great State of Idaho, impacted by Margaret's selfless service.  She's truly an extraordinary citizen who didn't just see providing  healthcare as a profession but as a calling. I join her colleagues in  honoring her lifetime of service.                            ____________________
