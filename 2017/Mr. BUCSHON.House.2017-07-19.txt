 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a rebounding  community in the Eighth District of Indiana.   Sullivan County, Indiana, is located in central western Indiana,  along the Wabash River. It is home to roughly 21,000 proud, hardworking  Hoosiers. The local economy relies on manufacturing and the coal and  transportation industries.   In the first 6 months of this new administration, we have worked with  the Trump administration to roll back the aggressive, job-killing  Federal regulations of the last 8 years that have devastated this area  of the country. The agenda we have set forth of less regulation and  lower taxes is breathing life into our local economies and communities  like Sullivan, Indiana.   As of May 2017, the unemployment rate in Sullivan County is at a 27- year low, sitting at 3.3 percent. Just a year ago, the unemployment was  7 percent.   Mr. Speaker, as we continue to work on behalf of the American people,  I am hopeful this trend continues.                            ____________________
