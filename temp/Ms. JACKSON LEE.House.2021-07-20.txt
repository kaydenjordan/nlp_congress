 Madam Speaker, I want to rise today to inform  everyone who might be listening that the filibuster is not in this  little book that has governed this great Nation, the Constitution of  the United States.   In fact, the 15th Amendment, as it relates to voting, says: ``The  right of citizens of the United States to vote should not be denied or  abridged by the United States or any State on account of race, color,  or previous condition of servitude,'' which means we should move  forward with certain things.   One, we need to move forward with the infrastructure bill. We must  move forward with the budget and budget reconciliation. We must ensure  that voting rights are protected in this Nation. Again, the filibuster  is not a constitutional provision, and therefore, we must govern.   Madam Speaker, I want to express my knowledge and concern of the  crime and violence across America. It is facing us in Houston as well.  I was delighted to bring almost a million dollars to help our victims  of crimes and the victim advocates program for HPD. It is time now to  stand up for America.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York  for her leadership on the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure  Protection, and Innovation.   Madam Speaker, I rise to support the State and Local Cybersecurity  Improvement Act.   I particularly emphasize the fact that we are the United States of  America, but the cyberattacks occur in our neighborhoods, our hamlets,  our cities, our counties, and our States. They occur right under our  noses, and they impact our constituents by taking their personal  records from the Texas Medical Center, for example, impacting the  medical care of people, interfering with various diagnostic machines,  and dealing with the energy infrastructure, such as the Colonial  Pipeline incident. These are happening in our neighborhoods.   The State and Local Cybersecurity Improvement Act will make $500  million available in grants from the Department of Homeland Security to  State, local, and Tribal entities over the next 4 years as they address  critical cybersecurity risks facing information systems.   I will soon rise to the floor on legislation that I have authored,  and I will make this point, Madam Speaker: It is crucial that the other  body begins to address the legislation that this House is able to pass  because we are passing innovative, corrective, and needed legislation.   Cyber is not a joke, if I can say that. Neither are the attacks on  our cyber infrastructure.   However, the Department of Homeland Security was created in 2002 to  bring together the expertise of several different government entities  to protect against foreign threats. At that time, the Nation's main  concern was protecting our citizens and residents from another large- scale terrorist attack, one that we had never seen before: attacking  tall buildings with airplanes. We had never seen it.   But, today, 2021, is not 2001. It is not 20 years ago, and the  landscape of terrorism has changed enormously. With rapid advancement  in technology and malign foreign cyber aggression in nation-states that  are not engaged, this bill is important.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, H.R. 3138, that will provide us a way to address this  issue.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York  for her leadership, and I thank the ranking member of the full  committee and the chair of the full committee for bringing these  matters to the attention of the Nation.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 2980, the  Cybersecurity Vulnerability Remediation Act, which authorizes the  Department of Homeland Security to take actions to counter  cybersecurity vulnerabilities in our Nation's critical infrastructure.   Interestingly enough, when we introduced this bill some years ago, we  called it the zero-day bill, which was to presuppose what would happen  when everything collapsed. When we introduced it, it was before the  Colonial Pipeline, it was before the Solaris attack, it was before  knowing about the gangs in Russia, cyber gangs that proliferate before  the activity of China.   I thank Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member Katko for their  leadership in putting the security of our Nation's cyber access first,  whether they are computing resources used in voting technology or  industrial control systems that support delivery of electricity, oil,  and gas, or management of transportation systems that are vital to our  Nation's economic health.   The Cybersecurity Vulnerability Remediation Act was introduced, as I  said, and passed the House during the 115th and 116th Congresses and  has been updated again in the 117th Congress to meet the ever-evolving  nature of cyber threats faced by Federal and private sector information  systems and our Nation's critical infrastructure.    As I said before, it will be very important that the other body  seriously considers the cyber threats against this Nation. This bill  goes significantly further than the first cybersecurity vulnerability  act that I introduced in the 115th Congress to address the instance of  zero-day events that can lead to catastrophic cybersecurity failures of  information and computing systems.   It is estimated that 85 percent of critical infrastructure is owned  by the private sector, and for far too long this fact has hampered  efforts to establish stronger requirements for cybersecurity by owners  and operators.   Private sector critical infrastructure failure due to a cyberattack  is no longer a private matter when it can have massive impacts on the  public, such as disruption of gasoline flowing to filling stations,  which we saw recently.   My bill, the Cybersecurity Vulnerability Remediation Act, will expand  [[Page H3698]]  the definition of security vulnerability to include cybersecurity  vulnerability; add sharing mitigation protocols to counter  cybersecurity vulnerabilities; establish protocols to counter  cybersecurity vulnerabilities involving information system and  industrial control systems, which will include vulnerabilities related  to software or hardware that is no longer supported by a vendor; direct  the undersecretary for DHS Office of Science and Technology to stand up  a competition to find solutions to known cybersecurity vulnerabilities;  provide greater transparency on how the Department of Homeland Security  CISA is coordinating cybersecurity vulnerability disclosures through  the sharing of actionable protocols to mitigate cybersecurity  vulnerabilities with information systems and industrial control systems  owners and operators.                                time  1330    H.R. 2980 bolsters the efforts to engage critical infrastructure  owners and operators in communicating cybersecurity threats and lays  the foundation for greater transparency on the real threats posed by  cyberterrorists to private and government sector critical  infrastructure and information systems, which impact the people of this  Nation.   This legislation allows the science and technology director, in  consultation with CISA, to establish an incentive-based program that  allows industry, individuals, academia, and others to compete in  identifying remediation solutions for cybersecurity vulnerabilities to  information systems and industrial control systems, including  supervisory control and data acquisition systems.   This bill, when it becomes law, will put our Nation's best minds to  work on closing the vulnerabilities that cyber thieves and terrorists  use to access, disrupt, corrupt, or take control of critical  infrastructure information systems.   In addition to these changes, the bill requires a report to Congress  that may contain a classified annex.   The report will provide information on how DHS coordinates  cybersecurity vulnerability disclosures and disseminates actionable  protocols to mitigate cybersecurity vulnerabilities involving  information systems and industrial systems.   Congress needs to know how prevalent and persistent cybersecurity  threats targeting critical infrastructure and information systems might  be, especially if those threats result in a payment of ransom. They  need to know about a payment of ransom.   Paying a ransom for ransomware emboldens and encourages bad cyber  actors and places everyone at greater risk for the financial and  societal costs of increases in threats as others seek payouts.    Madam Speaker, as long as there is silence about  cyberattacks like ransomware, the criminals and terrorists will remain  out of reach and continue to feel safe and emboldened in carrying out  these attacks, often from the soil of our enemies or peer competitors.   I applaud and thank the Biden administration for its quick action in  responding to the attack against Colonial Pipeline, but it did shut  down the whole East Coast, and he did it by an executive order.   Today, our Nation is in a cybersecurity crisis. The attacks against  Federal, State, local, territorial, and Tribal Governments, as well as  threats posed to private information systems and critical information  systems make this bill necessary.   So I am hoping, along with those who have been attacked, like the  Metropolitan Police Department, the medical system in Houston--the gang  known as the Babuk group released thousands of Metropolitan Police  sensitive documents, and it goes on and on.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record four articles regarding this  issue.                 [From the Forbes Magazine, July 20, 2021]  Turning Up The Heat: A Ransomware Attack On Critical Infrastructure Is                            a Nightmare Scenario                 (By Richard Tracy, Forbes Councils Member)         Ransomware attacks in 2020 were up more than 150% compared       to the previous year, while ransomware payments were up over       300%.        Over the past six months, we've seen a number of ransomware       attacks against critical infrastructure--from a water       treatment facility to a gas pipeline and multiple food       distribution companies--all of which present clear and       present danger to society. The impact was so dire--with       recent research finding over seven ransomware attacks per       hour--that the Department of Justice elevated ransomware       attacks to a similar priority as terrorism.        The recent Colonial Pipeline hack, in particular, appears       to have struck a nerve, as there is finally discussion about       cybersecurity standards for the pipeline industry. That would       be a good start and one that is long overdue considering the       importance of fuel distribution for our economy and overall       way of life.        However, the oil and gas industry is just one element in a       single critical infrastructure sector--the energy sector. DHS       has defined sixteen critical infrastructure sectors, and each       is deemed critical for the proper functioning of our society.       Due to the connected nature of everything these days, each       sector is a potential cyber target. Disruption to any       critical infrastructure segment has potentially dire       economic, safety and national security consequences. As such,       it only makes sense to address cybersecurity risk management       for all sectors, not just oil and gas.        The threat goes beyond the pipeline.        To better understand the need to focus on all critical       infrastructure, let's look at the power grid. Imagine a       ransomware attack against the power grid that services highly       populated areas in the desert southwest. Now, imagine this       attack takes place during the hottest part of the summer.        Think about the heat-related deaths that would likely occur       and the impact on medical supplies that require       refrigeration. Yes, there are generator backups in hospitals       where supplies are stored, but we already know from the       pipeline hack that the fuel needed to run these generators       can be disrupted too. It's also important to note that       hospitals, also considered critical infrastructure, have also       suffered from ransomware attacks. In fact, hospitals have had       an even bigger target on their backs in recent months. The       connected nature of our critical infrastructure compounds the       problem and potential impacts.        To further illustrate how important the power grid is to       our citizens, Protect Our Power, an independent, non-profit       advocacy and educational organization focused solely on       driving increased resilience of the U.S. electric grid to       attacks, recently conducted a public opinion poll of 1,095       Americans. Most notably, the study found:        86 percent of Americans are concerned that the grid is       vulnerable to a serious cyberattack.        70 percent say they would feel unsafe in the event of an       extended power outage of two weeks or more.        66 percent believe their quality of life will suffer from       an outage lasting more than seven days.        64 percent say they are unprepared for an extended power       outage that will last more than two weeks.        70 percent say the infrastructure bill should include       funding to address this important issue.        Only 16 percent believe the federal government is doing all       it can to prevent an attack on the grid.        As most Americans agree, the federal government can and       should do more to help secure all of our critical       infrastructures.        Recent ransomware attacks against critical infrastructure       help us understand standards and practices that would have       helped. For example, multi-factor authentication (MFA), a       widely recognized best practice, may have prevented the       Colonial Pipeline hack. According to GAO, greater and more       consistent adoption of the NIST CSF, which was specifically       developed to help critical infrastructure manage cyber risk,       would benefit cyber risk management efforts across all       critical infrastructure sectors.        In summary, we need to secure all critical infrastructure       sectors. The power grid example used here illustrates how       dire the consequences could be. It's time to move. Summer is       upon us, and the desert southwest is getting hot.                                   ____                   [From the New York Times, July 19, 2021]              U.S. Formally Accuses China of Hacking Microsoft                  (By Zolan Kanno-Youngs, David E. Sanger)         Washington.--The Biden administration on Monday formally       accused the Chinese government of breaching Microsoft email       systems used by many of the world's largest companies,       governments and military contractors, as the United States       joined a broad group of allies, including all NATO members,       to condemn Beijing for cyberattacks around the world.        The United States accused China for the first time of       paying criminal groups to conduct large-scale hackings,       including ransomware attacks to extort companies for millions       of dollars, according to a statement from the White House.       Microsoft had pointed to hackers linked to the Chinese       Ministry of State Security for exploiting holes in the       company's email systems in March; the U.S. announcement on       Monday morning was the first suggestion that the Chinese       government hired criminal groups to hack tens of thousands of       computers and networks around the  [[Page H3699]]       world for ``significant remediation costs for its mostly       private sector victims,'' according to the White House.        Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in a statement on       Monday that China's Ministry of State Security ``has fostered       an ecosystem of criminal contract hackers who carry out both       state-sponsored activities and cybercrime for their own       financial gain.''        ``These contract hackers cost governments and businesses       billions of dollars in stolen intellectual property, ransom       payments, and cybersecurity mitigation efforts, all while the       MSS had them on its payroll,'' Mr. Blinken said.        Condemnation from NATO and the European Union is unusual,       because most of their member countries have been deeply       reluctant to publicly criticize China, a major trading       partner. But even Germany, whose companies were hit hard by       the hacking of Microsoft Exchange--email systems that       companies maintain on their own, rather than putting them in       the cloud--cited the Chinese government for its work.        ``We call on all states, including China, to uphold their       international commitments and obligations and to act       responsibly in the international system, including in       cyberspace,'' according to a statement from NATO.        Despite the broadside, the announcement lacked sanctions       similar to ones that the White House imposed on Russia in       April, when it blamed the country for the extensive       SolarWinds attack that affected U.S. government agencies and       more than 100 companies. (The Justice Department on Friday       did unseal an indictment from May charging for Chinese       residents with a campaign to hack computer systems of dozens       of companies, universities and government entities in the       United States between 2011 and 2018. The hackers developed       front companies to hide any role the Chinese government had       in backing the operation, according to the Justice       Department.)        By imposing sanctions on Russia and organizing allies to       condemn China, the Biden administration has delved deeper       into a digital Cold War with its two main geopolitical       adversaries than at any time in modern history.        While there is nothing new about digital espionage from       Russia and China--and efforts by Washington to block it--the       Biden administration has been surprisingly aggressive in       calling out both countries and organizing a coordinated       response.        But so far, it has not yet found the right mix of defensive       and offensive actions to create effective deterrence, most       outside experts say. And the Russians and the Chinese have       grown bolder. The SolarWinds attack, one of the most       sophisticated ever detected in the United States, was an       effort by Russia's lead intelligence service to alter code in       widely used network-management software to gain access to       more than 18,000 businesses, federal agencies and think       tanks.        China's effort was not as sophisticated, but it took       advantage of a vulnerability that Microsoft had not       discovered and used it to conduct espionage and undercut       confidence in the security of systems that companies use for       their primary communications. It took the Biden       administration months to develop what officials say is ``high       confidence'' that the hacking of the Microsoft email system       was done at the behest of the Ministry of State Security, the       senior administration official said, and abetted by private       actors who had been hired by Chinese intelligence.        The last time China was caught in such broad-scale       surveillance was in 2014, when it stole more than 22 million       security-clearance files from the Office of Personnel       Management, allowing a deep understanding of the lives of       Americans who are cleared to keep the nation's secrets.        President Biden has promised to fortify the government,       making cybersecurity a focus of his summit meeting in Geneva       with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia last month. But       his administration has faced questions about how it will also       address the growing threat from China, particularly after the       public exposure of the Microsoft hacking.        Speaking to reporters on Sunday, the senior administration       official acknowledged that the public condemnation of China       would only do so much to prevent future attacks.        ``No one action can change China's behavior in       cyberspace,'' the official said. ``And neither could just one       country acting on its own.''        But the decision not to impose sanctions on China was also       telling: It was a step many allies would not agree to take.        Instead, the Biden administration settled on corralling       enough allies to join the public denunciation of China to       maximize pressure on Beijing to curtail the cyberattacks, the       official said.        The joint statement criticizing China, to be issued by the       United States, Australia, Britain, Canada, the European       Union, Japan and New Zealand, is unusually broad. It is also       the first such statement from NATO publicly targeting Beijing       for cybercrimes.        The European Union condemned on Monday ``malicious       cyberactivities'' undertaken from the Chinese territory but       stopped short of denouncing the responsibility of the Chinese       government.        ``This irresponsible and harmful behavior resulted in       security risks and significant economic our loss for       government institutions and private companies, and has shown       significant spillover and systemic effects for our security,       economy and society at large,'' Josep Borrell Fontelles, the       E.U.'s foreign policy chief, said in a statement. ``These       activities can be linked to the hacker groups,'' the       statement added.        Mr. Borrell called on Chinese authorities not to allow       ``its territory to be used'' for such activities, and to       ``take all appropriate measures and reasonably available and       feasible steps to detect, investigate and address the       situation.''        The National Security Agency, F.B.I. and Cybersecurity and       Infrastructure Security Agency also issued an advisory on       Monday warning that Chinese hacking presented a ``major       threat'' to the United States and its allies. China's targets       include ``political, economic, military, and educational       institutions, as well as critical infrastructure.''        Criminal groups hired by the government aim to steal       sensitive data, critical technologies and intellectual       properties, according to the advisory.        The F.B.I. took an unusual step in the Microsoft hacking:       In addition to investigating the attacks, the agency obtained       a court order that allowed it to go into unpatched corporate       systems and remove elements of code left by the Chinese       hackers that could allow follow-up attacks. It was the first       time that the F.B.I. acted to remediate an attack as well as       investigate its perpetrators.                                   ____               [From the New York Times, Updated June 8, 2021]       Pipeline Attack Yields Urgent Lessons About U.S. Cybersecurity                   (By David E. Sanger, Nicole Perlroth)         For years, government officials and industry executives       have run elaborate simulations of a targeted cyberattack on       the power grid or gas pipelines in the United States,       imagining how the country would respond.        But when the real, this-is-not-a-drill moment arrived, it       didn't look anything like the war games.        The attacker was not a terror group or a hostile state like       Russia, China or Iran, as had been assumed in the       simulations. It was a criminal extortion ring. The goal was       not to disrupt the economy by taking a pipeline offline but       to hold corporate data for ransom.        The most visible effects--long lines of nervous motorists       at gas stations--stemmed not from a government response but       from a decision by the victim, Colonial Pipeline, which       controls nearly half the gasoline, jet fuel and diesel       flowing along the East Coast, to turn off the spigot. It did       so out of concern that the malware that had infected its       back-office functions could make it difficult to bill for       fuel delivered along the pipeline or even spread into the       pipeline's operating system.        What happened next was a vivid example of the difference       between tabletop simulations and the cascade of consequences       that can follow even a relatively unsophisticated attack. The       aftereffects of the episode are still playing out, but some       of the lessons are already clear, and demonstrate how far the       government and private industry have to go in preventing and       dealing with cyberattacks and in creating rapid backup       systems for when critical infrastructure goes down.        In this case, the long-held belief that the pipeline's       operations were totally isolated from the data systems that       were locked up by DarkSide, a ransomware gang believed to be       operating out of Russia, turned out to be false. And the       company's decision to turn off the pipeline touched off a       series of dominoes including panic buying at the pumps and a       quiet fear inside the government that the damage could spread       quickly.        A confidential assessment prepared by the Energy and       Homeland Security Departments found that the country could       only afford another three to five days with the Colonial       pipeline shut down before buses and other mass transit would       have to limit operations because of a lack of diesel fuel.       Chemical factories and refinery operations would also shut       down because there would be no way to distribute what they       produced, the report said.        And while President Biden's aides announced efforts to find       alternative ways to haul gasoline and jet fuel up the East       Coast, none were immediately in place. There was a shortage       of truck drivers, and of tanker cars for trains.        ``Every fragility was exposed,'' Dmitri Alperovitch, a co-      founder of CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, and now       chairman of the think tank Silverado Policy Accelerator. ``We       learned a lot about what could go wrong. Unfortunately, so       did our adversaries.''        The list of lessons is long. Colonial, a private company,       may have thought it had an impermeable wall of protections,       but it was easily breached. Even after it paid the       extortionists nearly $5 million in digital currency to       recover its data, the company found that the process of       decrypting its data and turning the pipeline back on again       was agonizingly slow, meaning it will still be days before       the East Coast gets back to normal.        ``This is not like flicking on a light switch,'' Mr. Biden       said Thursday, noting that the 5,500-mile pipeline had never       before been shut down.        For the administration, the event proved a perilous week in       crisis management. Mr. Biden told aides, one recalled, that       nothing could wreak political damage faster than television       images of gas lines and rising prices, with the inevitable       comparison to Jimmy Carter's worse moments as president.        Mr. Biden feared that, unless the pipeline resumed       operations, panic receded and price gouging was nipped in the       bud, the situation  [[Page H3700]]       would feed concerns that the economic recovery is still       fragile and that inflation is rising.        Beyond the flurry of actions to get oil moving on trucks,       trains and ships, Mr. Biden published a long-gestating       executive order that, for the first time, seeks to mandate       changes in cybersecurity.        And he suggested that he was willing to take steps that the       Obama administration hesitated to take during the 2016       election hacks--direct action to strike back at the       attackers.        ``We're also going to pursue a measure to disrupt their       ability to operate,'' Mr. Biden said, a line that seemed to       hint that United States Cyber Command, the military's       cyberwarfare force, was being authorized to kick DarkSide off       line, much as it did to another ransomware group in the fall       ahead of the presidential election.        Hours later, the group's internet sites went dark. By early       Friday, DarkSide, and several other ransomware groups,       including Babuk, which has hacked Washington D.C.'s police       department, announced they were getting out of the game.        DarkSide alluded to disruptive action by an unspecified law       enforcement agency, though it was not clear if that was the       result of U.S. action or pressure from Russia ahead of Mr.       Biden's expected summit with President Vladimir V. Putin. And       going quiet might simply have reflected a decision by the       ransomware gang to frustrate retaliation efforts by shutting       down its operations, perhaps temporarily.        The Pentagon's Cyber Command referred questions to the       National Security Council, which declined to comment.        The episode underscored the emergence of a new ``blended       threat,'' one that may come from cybercriminals, but is often       tolerated, and sometimes encouraged, by a nation that sees       the attacks as serving its interests. That is why Mr. Biden       singled out Russia--not as the culprit, but as the nation       that harbors more ransomware groups than any other country.        ``We do not believe the Russian government was involved in       this attack, but we do have strong reason to believe the       criminals who did this attack are living in Russia,'' Mr.       Biden said. ``We have been in direct communication with       Moscow about the imperative for responsible countries to take       action against these ransomware networks.''        With DarkSide's systems down, it is unclear how Mr. Biden's       administration would retaliate further, beyond possible       indictments and sanctions, which have not deterred Russian       cybercriminals before. Striking back with a cyberattack also       carries its own risks of escalation.        The administration also has to reckon with the fact that so       much of America's critical infrastructure is owned and       operated by the private sector and remains ripe for attack.        ``This attack has exposed just how poor our resilience       is,'' said Kiersten E. Todt, the managing director of the       nonprofit Cyber Readiness Institute. ``We are overthinking       the threat, when we're still not doing the bare basics to       secure our critical infrastructure.''        The good news, some officials said, was that Americans got       a wake-up call. Congress came face-to-face with the reality       that the federal government lacks the authority to require       the companies that control more than 80 percent of the       nation's critical infrastructure adopt minimal levels of       cybersecurity.        The bad news, they said, was that American adversaries--not       only superpowers but terrorists and cybercriminals--learned       just how little it takes to incite chaos across a large part       of the country, even if they do not break into the core of       the electric grid, or the operational control systems that       move gasoline, water and propane around the country.        Something as basic as a well-designed ransomware attack may       easily do the trick, while offering plausible deniability to       states like Russia, China and Iran that often tap outsiders       for sensitive cyberoperations.        It remains a mystery how DarkSide first broke into       Colonial's business network. The privately held company has       said virtually nothing about how the attack unfolded, at       least in public. It waited four days before having any       substantive discussions with the administration, an eternity       during a cyberattack.        Cybersecurity experts also note that Colonial Pipeline       would never have had to shut down its pipeline if it had more       confidence in the separation between its business network and       pipeline operations.        ``There should absolutely be separation between data       management and the actual operational technology,'' Ms. Todt       said. ``Not doing the basics is frankly inexcusable for a       company that carries 45 percent of gas to the East Coast.''        Other pipeline operators in the United States deploy       advanced firewalls between their data and their operations       that only allow data to flow one direction, out of the       pipeline, and would prevent a ransomware attack from       spreading in.        Colonial Pipeline has not said whether it deployed that       level of security on its pipeline. Industry analysts say many       critical infrastructure operators say installing such       unidirectional gateways along a 5,500-mile pipeline can be       complicated or prohibitively expensive. Others say the cost       to deploy those safeguards are still cheaper than the losses       from potential downtime.        Deterring ransomware criminals, which have been growing in       number and brazenness over the past few years, will certainly       be more difficult than deterring nations. But this week made       the urgency clear.        ``It's all fun and games when we are stealing each other's       money,'' said Sue Gordon, a former principal deputy director       of national intelligence, and a longtime C.I.A. analyst with       a specialty in cyber issues, said at a conference held by The       Cipher Brief, an online intelligence newsletter. ``When we       are messing with a society's ability to operate, we can't       tolerate it.''                                   ____    [From MeriTalk: Improving the Outcomes of Government IT, May 20, 2021]     House Homeland Security Committee Advances Slate of Cybersecurity                                   Bills                             (By Lamar Johnson)         The House Homeland Security Committee voted May 18 to       advance five bills that would look to improve the nation's       cybersecurity in several areas, including protecting pipeline       infrastructure, testing cybersecurity readiness, and       improving state and local cybersecurity, among others.        The bills to advance out of committee included the Pipeline       Security Act, the CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure       Security Agency) Cyber Exercise Act, and the State and Local       Cybersecurity Improvement Act. Also advanced out of committee       were the Cybersecurity Vulnerability Remediation Act,       introduced by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Tex., and the       Domains Critical to Homeland Security Act, introduced by Rep.       John Katko, R-N.Y., the ranking member on the committee.        ``Since the beginning of this Congress, this Committee has       engaged in extensive oversight of these events and how the       Federal government partners with others to defend our       networks,'' Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said in a       release. ``The legislation we reported today was the result       of this oversight. I am pleased that they received broad       bipartisan support and hope they are considered on the House       floor in short order.''        The Pipeline Security Act was reintroduced by Rep. Emmanuel       Cleaver, D-Mo. just a day before advancing out of committee,       with the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack still top of       mind. If passed, it will codify CISA and the Transportation       Security Agency's responsibilities in protecting pipelines       from cyberattacks and terrorist attacks.        ``The Colonial Pipeline ransom ware attack that shut down       one [of] our nation's largest pipelines and triggered fuel       shortages across the northeast has brought new urgency to our       work to protect the country's critical infrastructure. This       attack also follows a string of disturbing cyberattacks       against government entities and the private sector,''       Thompson said.        The CISA Cyber Exercise Act would authorize and require       CISA to establish a National Cyber Exercise Program       responsible for testing the nation's cyber readiness. The       bill was introduced by Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., and would       direct the agency to create a set of exercises that states,       local governments, and private sector businesses could use to       test their cyber readiness.        State and local governments get a win with the advancement       of the State and Local Cybersecurity Improvement Act. The       bill was reintroduced by Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., on May       12, and a similar version passed in the House in the last       Congress. The bill would direct the Department of Homeland       Security (DHS) to create a $500 million-per-year grant       program to incentivize state and local governments to work to       improve their cybersecurity.        The committee also advanced two bills aimed at protecting       critical infrastructure and the supply chain after a recent       spate of cyberattacks exposed vulnerabilities in the       cybersecurity of each.        Rep. Lee's Cybersecurity Vulnerability Remediation Act       would authorize CISA to work with the owners and operators of       critical infrastructure on mitigation strategies around known       and critical vulnerabilities. Rep. Katko's Domains Critical       to Homeland Security Act would direct DHS to do research and       development around supply chain risks in domains that are       critical to the nation's economy. It would then be required       to submit that report to Congress.        The next step for all these bills is a vote on the full       House floor.     Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this  legislation because there is a known list of these attacks from the ISS  World to the $50 million paid. I ask my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I ask my friends in the other body, to pass this  legislation so it becomes law.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2980, ``The Cybersecurity  Vulnerability Remediation Act,'' which authorizes the Department of  Homeland Security to take actions to counter cybersecurity  vulnerabilities in our nation's critical infrastructure.   I thank Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member Katko for their  leadership in putting the security of our nation's cyber assets first,  whether they are computing resources used in voting technology or  industrial control systems that support the delivery of electricity,  oil and gas, or management of transportation systems that are vital to  our nation's economic health.  [[Page H3701]]    The Cybersecurity Vulnerability Remediation Act was introduced and  passed the House during the 115th and 116th Congresses and has been  updated again in the 117th Congress to meet the ever-evolving nature of  cyber threats faced by federal and private sector information systems  and our nation's critical infrastructure.   This bill goes significantly further than the first Cybersecurity  Vulnerability bill that I introduced in the 115th Congress, to address  the instance of Zero Day Events that can lead to catastrophic  cybersecurity failures of information and computing systems.   It is estimated that eighty-five percent of critical infrastructure  is owned by the private sector and for far too long this fact has  hampered efforts to establish stronger requirements for cybersecurity  by owners and operators.   Private sector critical infrastructure failure due to a cyberattack  is no longer a private matter when it can have massive impacts on the  public such as the disruption of gasoline flowing to filling stations.   The Jackson Lee Cybersecurity Vulnerability Remediation Act will:   Expand the definition of security vulnerability to include  cybersecurity vulnerability;   Adds sharing mitigation protocols to counter cybersecurity  vulnerabilities;   Establish protocols to counter cybersecurity vulnerabilities  involving information systems and industrial control systems, which  will include vulnerabilities related to software, or hardware that is  no longer supported by a vendor;   Direct the Under Secretary for the DHS Office of Science and  Technology to standup a competition to find solutions to known  cybersecurity vulnerabilities; and   Provide greater transparency on how the Department of Homeland  Security's Cybersecurity and Information Security Agency (CISA) is  coordinating cybersecurity vulnerability disclosures through the  sharing of actionable protocols to mitigate cybersecurity  vulnerabilities with information systems and industrial control systems  owners and operators.   H.R. 2890 bolsters the efforts to engage critical infrastructure  owners and operators in communicating cybersecurity threats; and lays  the foundation for greater transparency on the real threats posed by  cyberterrorist to private and government sector critical infrastructure  and information systems.   The legislation allows the Science the Technology Directorate in  consultation with CISA to establish an incentive based program that  allows industry, individuals, academia, and others to compete in  identifying remediation solutions for cybersecurity vulnerabilities to  information systems and industrial control systems including  supervisory control and data acquisition systems.   This bill when it becomes law would put our nation's best minds to  work on closing the vulnerabilities that cyber-thieves and terrorists  to use them to access, disrupt, corrupt, or take control of critical  infrastructure and information systems.   In addition to these changes, the bill requires a report to Congress  that may contain a classified annex.   The report will provide information on how DHS:   Coordinates cybersecurity vulnerability disclosures; and   Disseminates actionable protocols to mitigate cybersecurity  vulnerabilities involving information system and industrial systems.   Congress needs to know how prevalent and persistent cybersecurity  threats targeting critical infrastructure and information systems might  be, especially if those threats result in a payment of ransom.   Paying a ransom for ransomware emboldens and encourages bad cyber  actors and places everyone at greater risk for the financial and  societal costs of increases in threats as other seek payouts.   As long as there is silence about cyber-attacks like ransomware the  criminals and terrorists will remain out of reach and continue to feel  safe in carrying out these attacks often from the soil of our enemies  or peer competitors.   A company cannot stand up to Russia or China, but the United States  can and has done so to protect our national interest.   I applaud and thank the Biden Administration for its quick action to  respond to the attack against Colonial Pipeline in issuing a new  Executive Order.   Today, our nation is in a cybersecurity crisis.   My concern regarding the security of information networks began in  2015 when the Office of Personnel Management's data breach resulted in  the theft of millions of sensitive personnel records on federal  employees.   The attacks against federal, state, local, territorial, and tribal  governments, as well as threats posed to private information systems,  and critical infrastructure systems makes this bill necessary.   On May 13, 2021 it was reported that the DC Metropolitan Police  Department had experienced the worst reported cyberattack against a  police department in the United States.   The gang, known as the Babuk group, released thousands of the  Metropolitan Police Department's sensitive documents on the dark web  because the department would not pay.   Cyberthreats are not limited to information related to government  employees.   In February 2021, a cyberattack on an Oldsmar, Florida water  treatment facility involved increasing the levels of sodium hydroxide  from 100 parts per million to 11,100 parts per million in drinking  water.   However, the levels of this chemical in the water produced by  Oldsmar, Florida was increased to levels that would cause harm to  people if they drank or used it.   This is just one example of how terrorists can attack critical  infrastructure and cause threats to health, safety and life.   Cyber terrorists and cyber criminals are also motivated to attack  information networks in exchange for money.   The sources of revenue from cyberattacks has moved from demands of  payment for thieves not to release information--to the sale of stolen  information on the dark web and now to a sophisticated denial of  service attack in the form of ransomware that locks a system using  encryption until the victim pays.   A list of known ransomware attacks in 2020 that are suspected of  paying ransoms, included:   ISS World (Denmark) paid an estimated cost: $74 million;   Cognizant (US) paid an estimated $50 million;   Sopra Steria (French) paid estimated $50 million;   Redcar and Cleveland Council (UK) paid an estimated $14 million; and   University of California San Francisco (US) paid an estimated $1.14  million.   There are likely many other attacks that are not publicly known and  this must change if we are to defeat this threat.   Ransomware is becoming the tool of choice for those seeking a payout  because it can be carried out against anyone or any entity by  perpetrators who are far from U.S. shores.   The Colonial Pipeline incident is just one in a long line of  successful attacks or infiltrations carried out against domestic  information systems and critical infrastructure with increasing  consequences for the life, health, safety, and economic security of our  citizens.   CEO Joseph Blount testified before the U.S. Senate that the attack  occurred using a legacy Virtual Private Network (VPN) system that did  not have multifactor authentication.   In other words, hackers were able to gain access to this critical  infrastructure as a result of a single compromised password.   There would be no need for the Cybersecurity Vulnerability  Remediation Act if owners and operators were succeeding in meeting the  cybersecurity needs of critical infrastructure.   I know that there is more that should and ought to be done to address  the issue of cybercrime and I will be pursuing this avenue under the  jurisdiction of the House Judiciary Committee, as the chair of the  Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security.   Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues vote in support of H.R. 2890.    Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the gentlewoman from  North Carolina as she manages this rule and does it in an excellent  manner.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the underlying rule and to mention  that H.R. 2467, known as the PFAS Action Act, is an important step in  the right direction in providing safe and proper use of these  chemicals.   As well, I rise in support of H.R. 2668, which is dealing with  reinforcing the authority of the Federal Trade Commission.   Likewise, I rise in support of H.R. 3985, and I thank Jason Crow for  his leadership. That is, of course, expanding the Afghan Allies  Protection Act of 2009 to expedite the Special Immigrant Visa process  for certain Afghan allies, and for other purposes.    Mr. Speaker, we could not be making a more important statement and  doing a more important act. We are making a statement that says that we  do not forget our friends, our allies.   As a Member of the United States Congress since before 9/11, and  having interacted with the Afghanistan Government during the early  years, the creation of that government in Kabul, going to Kabul and  talking to the beginning, the embryonic parliamentarians, where there  were any number of women there in those early years after the war as  they began to set up their government, being a part of looking at their  constitution and having input into its democratic ideals, I know what  can happen when America leaves.   What happened when America left after the Iraq war? Schools with  girls were burned. Parliamentarians that were women lost their lives.   This is a dangerous condition, sadly. Those allies who provided us  services, who were translators, who provided the civilian services,  they are in danger.   This is the right direction. I thank the administration for working  with us and working with Mr. Crow. I am a cosponsor of this  legislation. It is time to move this now. I really hope the other body  seriously takes into account that we are saving lives.   As the co-chair of the Afghan Caucus, I think it is crucial for us to  save lives. This is an important initiative. We need to do more. I  think there are 8,000 visas. We need to do more, but this is an  excellent step. I really support the  [[Page H3713]]  efforts of Mr. Crow and thank him for his leadership.   We are going to be monitoring this. We must monitor what the Taliban  is doing, and we must make sure that lives are saved.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule  governing debate of H.R. 2668, the ``Consumer Protection and Recovery  Act'', which will ensure that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) can  protect American consumers and put money back in the pockets of  consumers who have been the victims of fraud and other scams by  amending the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act) to explicitly  provide the FTC the ability to obtain both injunctive and monetary  equitable relief for all violations of the laws it enforces.   Specifically, this bill would:   Add a new subsection (e) to section 13 of the FTC Act that specifies  types of equitable relief the FTC may pursue: restitution for losses,  contract reformation and recission, money refunds, and the return of  property;   Provide the FTC disgorgement authority to seek court orders requiring  bad actors repay unjust gains acquired in violation of the law.   Clarify that the FTC may seek temporary restraining orders and  preliminary injunctions without bond and that any relief sought under  section 13(b) may be for past violations in addition to ongoing and  imminent violations.   As the Nation's premier consumer protection agency, the FTC is  directed to enforce numerous statutes: the core of which is section 5  of the FTC Act mandating the agency to prevent unfair or deceptive acts  or practices and unfair methods of competition.   Section 13(b) of the FTC Act authorizes the FTC to bring suit in  federal courts seeking relief for consumers and is a critical  enforcement tool the FTC uses to combat fraud and scams under section  5.   In 2020 alone, the FTC returned more than $482 million to over 1.6  million consumer victims of fraud or illegal business practices.   The FTC's restitution authority under section 13(b) was settled law  for over 40 years, but  [[Page H3714]]  beginning in 2017, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed its  own precedent to overturn FTC authority under section 13(b) to obtain  monetary relief and the Third Circuit soon followed.   Because of these decisions, close to 48 million Americans in six  states became unable to obtain monetary redress under 13(b).   Then, on April 22, 2021, the Supreme Court held in AMG Capital  Management v. FTC that section 13(b) does not allow the FTC to seek  monetary relief or require bad actors to return money earned through  illegal activity.   According to Acting Chairwoman Slaughter, the Supreme Court decision  ``deprived the FTC of the strongest tool [the FTC] had to help  consumers.''   Mr. Speaker, all five FTC Commissioners have repeatedly urged  Congress to take quick action to pass legislation reaffirming FTC  authority under section 13(b).   H.R. 2668 does exactly that, by restoring nearly forty years of  precedent and giving the FTC the ability to protect Americans from  scams and unethical business practices.   Americans need this protection, because every day, and far too often,  individuals in Texas and across the country fall victim to financial  scammers.   The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to an increase of scams and  fraud that prey on consumers' fears and financial insecurities, and  inaction on this issue is not an option as it will only embolden bad  actors.   H.R. 2668 will ensure that the FTC maintains its ability to return  money to the victims of scams.   Seniors especially need this protection, because they have worked  their entire lives with the promise of a safe and secure retirement,  but scammers and unscrupulous businesses are taking advantage of  uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and working overtime to target  them.   Retirement accounts are not the only damage these scams cause--they  damage the independence and trust of a vulnerable community.   During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen instances of fraud rise in  unprecedented numbers, as scammers attempt to take advantage of senior  citizens and deprive them of their hard-earned savings.   Bad actors preying on older Americans is, unfortunately, nothing new,  but in the midst of a global pandemic impacting Americans' lives and  livelihoods, cracking down on those scams must be a priority.   One such scam was thwarted by Houston police and the Harris County  District Attorney, who made an arrest in February in an international  cyber-scam that bilked unsuspecting, mostly elderly victims out of more  than $1 million.   One victim of the scam, Asuncion Peppers, 74, a retired medical  technician knows that first hand; She was bilked out of her life  savings.   Hackers contacted Ms. Peppers on Facebook, pretending to be one of  her Facebook friends.   She was told she was eligible for a government grant of almost one  million dollars and all she had to do was send a check to pay taxes.   Investigators believes the scammers were operating from Nigeria,  defrauding senior citizens in the U.S. and around the world.   Before Ms. Peppers realized she was being conned, she sent checks  totaling $87,000 hard-earned money.   She said that she worked three jobs to build her life savings.   Ms. Peppers and her husband are just two of 38 victims bilked out of  more than $1.3 million before the fraud was discovered.   This story is not an isolated incident: although 1 in 20 seniors in  the U.S. is a target of fraud schemes, the National Adult Protective  Services Association has found that only 1 in 44 seniors report that  they are victims of a fraud scheme.   During these unprecedented times, it is imperative that Congress pass  legislation that protects U.S. consumers and honest businesses from  wrongdoers who steal money through fraud and deception.   Mr. Speaker, we need to strengthen federal prevention efforts and  ensure leaders in the public and private sectors are collaborating on  effective safeguards.   This begins with ensuring that the FTC has the explicit authority to  obtain both injunctive and monetary relief for all violations of the  laws it enforces.   I urge all members to join me in voting for the rule and the  underlying legislation, H.R. 2668, the ``Consumer Protection and  Recovery Act.''   The material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 535         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 8 Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (S. 1867) to require the Director of National       Intelligence to declassify information relating to the origin       of COVID-19, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall       be considered as read. All points of order against provisions       in the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence; and (2) one motion to commit.        Sec. 9 Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of S. 1867.     Mr. Speaker, it is always important to have an  opportunity to speak to our colleagues and as well the American people.  Tonight, I will dwell on questions of human rights, challenges to those  human  [[Page H3746]]  rights and the legacy of the undermining of human rights even in  America that will include aspects of such indignities around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes)  who will start with a discussion on a longstanding and well-known  historic violations of human rights.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  leadership. We must always remember that human rights are equal to  human dignity.   So it is my privilege tonight to stand to discuss the value of  recognizing human dignity. As I do so, let me add to an earlier  discussion that reflects on giving our children human dignity.   Isn't it amazing how children have suffered in the course of the most  recent history depredation of wealth, and so they have been ensconced  in poverty, they have been hungry, and they have been without a good  education? These are children in America. We can speak about children  around the world. They have had little access to broadband technology,  and they have suffered in their housing provisions, if you will.   So I am very proud to just start out by, again, applauding the  American Rescue Act and also the life-changing impact of the child tax  credit. I don't think we can do that enough. And children of color have  been at the front of the line and we are able to help with food and  childcare, diapers, healthcare, clothing, taxes.   Poor, working, and middle class families are able to receive the same  amount. You will see, Mr. Speaker, where I am going on this because we  don't do this in anger. We don't do this because we are mad. We do this  because it is righting the wrong, as one of my colleagues said.   This will provide $250 per month, per child and $300 per month for  every young child. That means children under 5. All families in my  district will be able to feel more secure. Let me run through these  numbers because they are stunning.   The 18th Congressional District in Houston, Texas, Mr. Speaker, 91.7  percent of children in my district will gain from the expanded and  improved child tax credit. I know that because I have been immersed in  childcare education events.   We have been in a church, we have been at my Federal building, we  have been up and down on the radio, we have been everywhere we could be  to ensure that we did it with humor, with seriousness, with compassion,  being out on the street corners along with trying to encourage people  to get vaccinated. We have been saying: Get ready for the child tax  credit President Biden and the Democratic Congress worked so hard on.   Mr. Speaker, 91.7 percent of the children will gain in my district.  That is 202,800 children.   I have schools in my district that are 100 percent at risk, and they  eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner. There is no shame to helping  children. Behind those children are parents who are suffering. These  dollars will help these parents have dignity, their children have  dignity, and their children have resources.   The average benefit for 56,700 households in my district--Houston, I  hope you are listening--is $3,500.   If you have not filed your taxes in the 2019 year, you can  immediately get help from my office at 713-655-0050 or the IRS tax  advocacy team, also in my building of 1919 Smith Street in Houston,  Texas.   Don't miss the opportunity for your own human dignity. It is not a  handout. It is a hand up. The expanded and improved child tax credit  lifts 21,800 children in my district out of poverty. Because of the  larger benefits for the youngest, 8,400 kids under the age of 6 are  raised out of poverty. That has expanded across America where millions  of children face a new day.                                time  1945    Families with children in poverty receive $5,300 on average, and they  are getting some 6,500 children in my district out of deep poverty. We  know now that we are engaged in the appropriations process. I thank  Chairwoman DeLauro and all of the appropriators for their work. We know  how important it is if you are going to do something in life, this  year, 2021, in the aftermath of COVID-19, this is the year to do it  with the appropriations bill. This is the year to do it. Again, my  theme: a sense of dignity.   And where does that take me now? Well, I must deviate for a moment,  Mr. Speaker, to just indicate that I think the Biden-Harris team has  brought to America a sense of compassion. It has turned anger and ugly  words into reaching out to people where they are. That could mean  people who oppose them. But they reach out to them where they are, and  they reach them with a sense of understanding and acceptance that they  must cast leadership for all of America, even if people disagree with  them.   So my good friend was here on the floor--I am sorry that he has  left--but I want to emphasize that Vice President Kamala Harris is  doing an excellent job on some very tough issues. She is meeting on  voting rights and meeting with any number of persons. I want to remind  America that Texas Democratic State representatives who had some  medical mishaps here or medical circumstances with COVID-19--no one is  immune--are still here fighting so that we can have voting rights.   She has met with all of them. She is deeply engaged in making sure  that we work together as a Congress to get voting rights done along  with the Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Beatty and all of us as  Members who are standing ready. So she is doing an excellent job. And I  will tell you, living on the border myself, living in Texas, in the  region, having gone to the border over and over again, she is doing a  job that should be done that others are not doing, getting into the  weeds and understanding what the President's  [[Page H3747]]  path should be as we go forward on immigration reform.   She has been to the Northern Triangle. That is the heart of where the  issues start, and they are working to discern how they can best stop  the massive flow of migrants, immigrants, who are in fear of their  lives living in the countries that they are living in. These are tough  issues, and I just want to say thank you to Vice President Kamala  Harris, because some people misunderstand and think that it is just an  easy thing to do.   My word from Texas on her trip was excellent, and that people were  receptive to her intellect, her compassion, and her willingness to get  the job done. And the job will be done.   So as I say that, I indicated this will be a night about human  rights. And so I want to give you a little education about legislation  that we are so pleased about. Can you imagine, H.R. 40, the Commission  to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans having  nearly 200 sponsors, cosponsors of individuals who have come from many  parts of the country. And so I am speaking to my colleagues who happen  to be Republicans, and I want to give them the opportunity to realize  just what this bill is.   I heard someone say ``restoration,'' and I heard someone say  ``repair,'' and they are right. My good friend, the Honorable Barbara  Lee, we are working in tandem together, working in tandem on H. Res.  19, which is reconciliation and restoration, and then the bill, H.R.  40, legislation to create a commission that would study effectively  slavery, and as well then develop reparation proposals. Again,  restoration, repair.   Let us remove ourselves from any sort of shackle on the question of  reparations. Let us be understanding of someone else's pain, someone  else's history; that is, in fact, American history. So I hold up this  bill, because I said I would do show and tell, H.R. 40. Look at the  pile of Members here as original cosponsors, and they have been coming  on and on, and I want to just say thank you to my friends and  colleagues who have thoughtfully felt the need to say how do we heal  America's systemic racism; and how do we heal institutional racism; how  do we ignore what is, in fact, truth.   Now, I think most of you know I could not stand here without saying  thank you to the 415 Members of Congress who voted along with the  United States Senate on Juneteenth. Do you realize that Juneteenth is  the first time America has acknowledged the history of slavery? In  1865, those of us west of the Mississippi just got the word from the  Union soldiers with General Granger that we were free by General Order  No. 3.   Juneteenth is a commemoration of that. And I want everyone to know  that, frankly, 47 States have already been celebrating in their own way  Juneteenth. After 38 years, we have a new Federal holiday called  Juneteenth, which gives America and little schoolchildren the  opportunity to ask their dad or their teacher: What is Juneteenth? That  was holding people in bondage, but it was setting them free.   After the bloodiest war, brothers against brothers, the Civil War,  where Abraham Lincoln so emotionally indicated: ``A house divided  cannot stand,'' but General Granger came and Sam Collins held a  magnificent celebration on June 19 in Houston, in Galveston, in that  region where I represent, and the mural was unveiled by a magnificent  artistic team led by Reginald Adams out of Third Ward, Texas, which is  Houston, which is where my congressional district is, and it told the  story of the freedom of these slaves. And we repeated General Order No.  3 which says, ``equality of personal rights'' but the biggest thing it  said was, ``the slaves are free.'' And that we insist upon equality of  rights. That is all that H.R. 40 is about.   Are we to deny equality of rights? That was in General Order No. 3.  That is what the President, unfortunately, being assassinated,  President Abraham Lincoln sent General Granger down to read to the  slaves who had worked and been beaten for 2\1/2\ more years.   It is important that we not ignore what slavery was all about. This  is the whelped and beaten back and scarred back of a slave. Let us be  clear. Bondage, we are the only group of Americans that have been held  in bondage in this Nation, and we have been held or were held in  bondage longer than this country has been a nation. For 246 years, we  were held in bondage, and we only celebrated our 245th birthday.    So I am here to be able to, very briefly, run you through a brief  history. Let me do this. Let me first of all talk about the words of  Gary Abernathy, who proudly says that he is a conservative.   And Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining, please?    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate it, only to make sure that  I can now flow with the concept of the time.   But the headline reads: ``Why I support reparations--and all  conservatives should.''   I know my friends are listening here on the other side. Gary  Abernathy. And I will take some excerpts from this. He acknowledges  that he is a conservative. And I can venture to say that his  credentials can be documented.   But he says, in spite of the bill that I have offered--has an  apology--he takes note of that, he even indicates that he may not be  that enthusiastic about that. But he says, ``In fact, it could be  argued that the idea fits within the conservative philosophy,'' meaning  that the notion of reparations is worth discussing because he says,  ``In fact, it could be argued that the idea fits the conservative  philosophy.''   He goes on to say, ``But it is undeniable that White people have  disproportionately benefited from both the labor and the legacy of  slavery, and--crucially--will continue to do so for generations to  come.''   None of this is said with anger. It is only setting forth facts. When  slavery was abolished after a bloody Civil War, African Americans were  dispersed into a world that was overtly hostile to them.  ``Reconstruction efforts were bitterly resisted by most Southern  Whites, and attempts to educate and employ former slaves happened only  in fits and starts.''   Remember, this is a group of people in the millions who simply were  set free. Freedom is precious. We cannot deny how precious freedom was,  how sweet it was, but they were given nothing; nothing to start their  lives, and they came into the hostility of people who really didn't  want them to be free. That was the bulk of the South, and many parts of  the North. ``The government even reneged on its `40 acres and a mule'  pledge. After slavery, prejudice and indifference continued to fuel  social and economic disparity.''   Be reminded of the whipped back of this Black man, this slave. And  there were whipped backs of women and children. They lived through this  through no fault of their own. They worked and toiled in the fields.  They made cotton king. They built the economic engine of this Nation.  They created a transatlantic slave trade. They sent millions of dollars  from the South to the Wall Street banks, and we built America.   They built this place where I stand, the United States Capitol, with  their bare hands, and they built the White House. What else could they  have built?   And so when slavery was abolished, there was silence. It has been  represented that there is a gap of $17,600 shows the median Black  household net worth, to a $174,000 wage of the average American or  White family.   When parents offered gifts to help children buy a home, avoid student  debt, or start a business, those children are more able to retain and  build on their wealth over their lifetimes. I think we just saw a very  unique occasion today regarding space. I would not in any way say  anything but congratulations, but one of those persons paid $27 million  to be on that historic moment. Calculate that. It is a personal  payment. It wasn't government.   And, again, I celebrate the occasion, but juxtapose that against  where we are or where African Americans are. Randall Robinson made the  point that even affirmative action would never close the economic gap.  ``Blacks, even middle-class Blacks, have no paper assets to speak of.  They may be salaried, but they're only a few months away from poverty  if they should lose those jobs . . . ''   And many times the ravages of discrimination and segregation are  intertwined in law, and they may lose their jobs.  [[Page H3748]]    And so this conservative author believes in reparations. And he  believes that this can be done with a fair amount of dollars, but there  is more to it, as you will hear me say, because it is not about money.   He concludes by saying: ``It is a tenet of conservatism that a level  playing field is all we should guarantee. But that's meaningless if one  team starts with an unsurmountable lead before play even begins.''   I think LBJ said: If you want to tell people about a fair race,  meaning a running race, and one fellow or lady has shackles around  their ankles and the whistle blows, get ready, go, it is not a fair  race because one runner is freed and has all of the elements of  freedom, and the ability to do great things, and one is running with  leg irons on.   So as we look at how we can as a nation, a community come together, I  don't know how many times I want to raise the question that we are not  doing this in anger. H.R. 40, first introduced by John Conyers, is an  international concept. It just means repair. It means doing the right  thing, healing, dealing with injustices. It will not be painful.   But let me tell you why this legislation is not painful, because it  is a study that will give us a roadmap and it will be done with  academicians and those who are appointed by government leaders, and  they will be balanced and they will be responsible and they will be  thorough.                                time  2000    Why do we think we need it?   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the article from Gary Abernathy,  Washington Post contributing columnist.                 [From the Washington Post, Apr. 22, 2021]      Opinion: Why I Support Reparations--and All Conservatives Should                (By Gary Abernathy, Contributing columnist)         Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) is among the progressive       lawmakers whose blunt, liberal outspokenness regularly annoys       me. Recently, she particularly upset me while discussing the       latest congressional study of reparations for descendants of       enslaved people, when she said, ``If you through your history       benefited from that wrong that was done, then you must be       willing to commit yourself to righting that wrong.'' Only       this time I was bothered because her comments hit home. Like       most conservatives, I've scoffed at the idea of reparations       or a formal apology for slavery. I did not own slaves, so why       would I support my government using my tax dollars for       reparations or issuing an apology? Further, no one in the       United States has been legally enslaved since 1865, so why       are Black people today owed anything more than the same       freedoms and opportunities that I enjoy?        I remain unconvinced that an apology would have much real       value, but the more substantive notion of reparations is       worth discussing. In fact, it could be argued that the idea       fits within the conservative philosophy. We'll come back to       that. But it is undeniable that White people have       disproportionately benefitted from both the labor and the       legacy of slavery, and--crucially--will continue to do so for       generations to come.        When slavery was abolished after a bloody civil war,       African Americans were dispersed into a world that was       overtly hostile to them. Reconstruction efforts were bitterly       resisted by most Southern Whites, and attempts to educate and       employ former slaves happened only in fits and starts. The       government even reneged on its ``40 acres and a mule''       pledge. After slavery, prejudice and indifference continued       to fuel social and economic disparity.        The result is unsurprising. As noted by scholars A. Kirsten       Mullen and William A. Darity Jr., co-authors of ``From Here       to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-      First Century,'' data from the 2016 Survey of Consumer       Finances showed that median Black household net worth       averaged $17,600--a little more than one-tenth of median       White net worth. As Mullen and Darity write, ``white parents,       on average, can provide their children with wealth-related       intergenerational advantages to a far greater degree than       black parents. When parents offer gifts to help children buy       a home, avoid student debt, or start a business, those       children are more able to retain and build on their wealth       over their own lifetimes.''        Black author and activist Randall Robinson has argued that       even laws such as those on affirmative action ``will never       close the economic gap. This gap is structural. . . . blacks,       even middle-class blacks, have no paper assets to speak of.       They may be salaried, but they're only a few months away from       poverty if they should lose those jobs, because . . . they've       had nothing to hand down from generation to generation       because of the ravages of discrimination and segregation,       which were based in law until recently.''        In addition to the discrepancy in inherited wealth, even       conservatives should be able to acknowledge that Whites enjoy       generational associations in the business world, where who       you know often counts more than what you know--a reality       based not so much on overt racism as on employment and       promotion patterns within old-school networks that Blacks       lack the traditional contacts to consistently intersect.        For now, support for reparations is anemic. A House       Judiciary Committee bill creating a commission to merely       study the idea was opposed last week by 17 Republicans,       though all 25 Democrats on the committee voted for it; and       just 1 in 5 respondents in a Reuters/Ipsos poll last June       agreed that the United States should use tax dollars for       reparations--not shocking, when a price tag of $10 trillion       has been suggested.        The cost can be debated, along with the mechanics of a       compensation package. But in the current drunken haze of       government spending, appropriating trillions for the noble       purpose of bringing Black Americans who remain economically       penalized by the enslavement of their ancestors closer to the       fiscal universe of White citizens surely seems less       objectionable than some recent spending proposals.        It is a tenent of conservatism that a level playing field       is all we should guarantee. But that's meaningless if one       team starts with an unsurmountable lead before play even       begins.        It's not necessary to experience ``White guilt'' or buy       into the notion of ``White privilege,'' a pejorative that to       me suggests Whites possess something they should lose, when       in fact such benefits should extend to all. Supporting       reparations simply requires a universal agreement to work       toward, as Jayapal said, ``righting that wrong.''     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a Washington  Post article, ``U.N. rights chief: Reparations needed for people facing  racism.''                 [From the Washington Post, June 28, 2021]        UN Rights Chief: Reparations Needed for People Facing Racism                             (By Jamey Keaten)         Geneva (AP)--The U.N. human rights chief, in a landmark       report launched after the killing of George Floyd in the       United States, is urging countries worldwide to do more to       help end discrimination, violence and ) systemic racism       against people of African descent and ``make amends'' to       them--including through reparations.        The report from Michelle Bachelet, the U.N. High       Commissioner for Human rights, offers a sweeping look at the       roots of centuries of mistreatment faced by Africans and       people of African descent, notably from the transatlantic       slave trade. It seeks a ``transformative'' approach to       address its continued impact today.        The report, a year in the making, hopes to build on       momentum around the recent, intensified scrutiny worldwide       about the blight of racism and its impact on people of       African descent as epitomized by the high-profile killings of       unarmed Black people in the United States and elsewhere.        ``There is today a momentous opportunity to achieve a       turning point for racial equality and justice,'' the report       said.        The report aims to speed up action by countries to end       racial injustice; end impunity for rights violations by       police; ensure that people of African descent and those who       speak out against racism are heard; and face up to past       wrongs through accountability and redress.        I am calling on all states to stop denying--and start       dismantling--racism; to end impunity and build trust; to       listen to the voices of people of African descent; and to       confront past legacies and deliver redress,'' Bachelet said       in a video statement.        While broaching the issue of reparation in her most       explicit way yet, Bachelet suggested that monetary       compensation alone is not enough and would be part of an       array of measures to help rectify or make up for the       injustices.        ``Reparations should not only be equated with financial       compensation,'' she wrote, adding that it should include       restitution, rehabilitation, acknowledgement of injustices,       apologies, memorialization, educational reforms and       ``guarantees'' that such injustices won't happen again.        Bachelet, a former president of Chile, hailed the efforts       of advocacy groups like the Black Lives Matter movement,       saying they helped provide ``grassroots leadership through       listening to communities'' and that they should receive       ``funding, public recognition and support.''        The U.N.-backed Human Rights Council commissioned the       report during a special session last year following the       murder of Floyd, a Black American who was killed by a white       police officer in Minneapolis in May 2020. The officer, Derek       Chauvin, was sentenced to 22-1/ 2 years in prison last week.        Protests erupted after excruciating bystander video showed       how Floyd gasped repeatedly, ``I can't breathe!'' as       onlookers yelled at Chauvin to stop pressing his knee on       Floyd's neck.        The report was based on discussions with over 340 people--      mostly of African descent--and experts; more than 100       contributions in writing, including from governments; and       review of public material, the rights office said.        It analyzed 190 deaths, mostly in the U.S., to show how law       enforcement officers are  [[Page H3749]]       rarely held accountable for rights violations and crimes       against people of African descent, and it noted similar       patterns of mistreatment by police across many countries.        The report ultimately aims to transform those opportunities       into a more systemic response by governments to address       racism, and not just in the United States--although the       injustices and legacy of slavery, racism and violence faced       by African Americans was clearly a major theme.        The report also laid out cases, concerns and the situation       in roughly 60 countries including Belgium, Brazil, Britain,       Canada, Colombia and France among others.        ``We could not find a single example of a state that has       fully reckoned with the past or comprehensively accounted for       the impacts of the lives of people of African descent       today,'' Mona Rishmawi, who heads a unit on non-      discrimination in Bachelet's office. ``Our message,       therefore, is that this situation is untenable.''        Compensation should be considered at the ``collective and       the individual level,'' Rishmawi said, while adding that any       such process ``starts with acknowledgment'' of past wrongs       and ``it's not one-size-fits-all.'' She said countries must       look at their own pasts and practices to assess how to       proceed.        Rishmawi said Bachelet's team found ``a main part of the       problem is that many people believe the misconceptions that       the abolition of slavery, the end of the transatlantic trade       and colonialism have removed the racially discriminatory       structures built by those practices.        ``We found that this is not true,'' said Rishmawi, also       denouncing an idea among some ``associating blackness with       criminality . . . there is a need to address this.''        The report called on countries to ``make amends for       centuries of violence and, discrimination'' such as through       ``formal acknowledgment and apologies, truth-telling       processes and reparations in various forms.''        It also decried the ``dehumanization of people of African       descent'' that was ``rooted in false social constructions of       race'' in the past to justify enslavement, racial stereotypes       and harmful practices as well as tolerance for racial       discrimination, inequality and violence.        People of African descent face inequalities and ``stark       socioeconomic and political marginalization'' in many       countries, the report said, including unfair access to       education, health care, jobs, housing and clean water.        ``We believe very strongly that we only touched the tip of       the iceberg,'' Rishmawi said, referring to the report. ``We       really believe that there is a lot more work that needs to be       done.''     This report came from the United Nations because  reparations is a universal concept of repair, repairing, and human  rights. This report from the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights is  big stuff. It ``offers a sweeping look at the roots of centuries of  mistreatment faced by Africans and people of African descent, notably  from the transatlantic slave trade.''   Does that sound familiar? Back and forth across the ocean.   ``It seeks a `transformative' approach to address its continued  impact today.''   In its report, it says: ``I am calling on all states to stop denying,  and start dismantling, racism; to end impunity and build trust; to  listen to the voices of people of African descent; and to confront past  legacies and deliver redress.''   This is what this report from the United Nations has said.   It goes on to say: ``Reparations should not only be equated with  financial compensation.''   This is what I have been saying. I say that when I go on the floor  and ask for my colleagues to support it. Thank goodness we understand  it. We get it. I am looking for my Republican friends to join us.   ``Adding that it should include restitution, rehabilitation,  acknowledgment of injustices, apologies, memorialization, education  reforms, and `guarantees' that such injustices won't happen again.''   Does that sound unfair?   ``We could not find a single example of a state that has fully  reckoned with the past or comprehensively accounted for the impacts on  the lives of people of African descent.''   This individual, who was head of the unit on nondiscrimination, said:  ``Our message, therefore, is that this situation is untenable.''   This is the report from the U.N.   ``A main part of the problem is that many people believe the  misconceptions that the abolition of slavery, the end of the  transatlantic trade, and colonialism have removed the racially  discriminatory structures built by those practices.''   Absolutely wrong. The report found that this is not true, ``also  denouncing an idea among some `associating blackness with  criminality.''' That has gone on in many places around the world,  including the United States.   This report also ``decried the `dehumanization of people of African  descent' that was `rooted in false social constructions of race' in the  past to justify enslavement, racial stereotypes, and harmful practices  as well as tolerance for racial discrimination, inequality, and  violence.''   Do we realize that that hurts all of our children? Children who are  White and non-White are hurt by the definitions of color and Africans  and people of African descent.   We face inequalities, meaning those of African descent, and ``'stark  socioeconomic and political marginalization' in many countries, the  report said, including unfair access to education, healthcare, jobs,  housing, and clean water.''   What the commission could do is to give peace and understanding of  the very fact of what would be a positive response to this question of  discrimination.   I want to add some real scientific evidence that I am not here on the  floor complaining. I am giving an opportunity, along with the  infrastructure bill, along with the budget reconciliation, because I am  on the Budget Committee, along with voting rights, after 30-some years  when this bill was first introduced in 1989, after the Japanese  received reparations in 1988, of which we supported.   Thank you to the Japanese American Association. They are strong  supporters of H.R. 40. They got reparations for their false and unfair  internment in the 1940s during World War II. We celebrated it. We  worked with them and helped them construct that, those who were in  Congress at that time.   John Conyers filed this bill shortly after 1989, and I am honored to  have been given this challenge and opportunity by him upon his  retirement. I will not let the Nation down. I say the Nation because a  definitive study is worthy. It I might show you that the idea of  reparations is to suggest a continued, systemic impact, a continued,  systemic impact that is going on, even in this moment.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this article that is part of the  Harvard Medical School's continuing coverage of medicine, and you would  not believe it.                [From Harvard Medical School, Feb, 10, 2021]    Anti-Racist Epidemiology--Research Suggests Reparations for Slavery         Could Have Reduced COVID-19 Infections and Deaths in U.S.                              (By Jake Miller)         This article is part of Harvard Medical School's continuing       coverage of medicine, biomedical research, medical education       and policy related to the SARS-Co V-2 pandemic and the       disease COVID-19.        Civil rights activists have long called for monetary       reparations to the Black descendants of Africans enslaved in       the United States as a financial, moral, and ethical form of       restitution for the injustices of slavery.        Now, a study led by Harvard Medical School researchers       suggests reparations could also have surprising public health       benefits for Black individuals and the entire nation.        To estimate the impact of structura inequities between       Black and white individuals, the researchers set out to       capture the effect of reparation payments on the Black-white       wealth gap in the state of Louisiana.        Their analysis, published online on Feb. 9 in Social       Science & Medicine. suggests that if reparations had teen       made before the COVID-19 pandemic, transmission of SARS-CoV-2       in the state's overall population could have been reduced by       anywhere from 31 percent to 68 percent.        The work was done in collaboration with the Lancet       Commission on Reparations and Redistributive Justice.        ``While there are compelling moral and historical arguments       for racial-injustice interventions such as reparations, our       study demonstrates that repairing the damage caused by the       legacy of slavery and Jim Crow racism would have enormous       benefits to the entire population of tbe United States,''       said study senior author Eugene Richardson. assistant       professor of global health and social medicine in the       Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School.        The disproportionate effects of COVID-19 on racial       minorities--Black individuals in particular--have been well       documented. Black people get COVID-19 at a rate nearly one       and a half times higher than that of white people, are       hospitalized at a rate nearly four times higher, and are       three times as likely to die from the disease, according to       the latest estimates from the U.S. Centers for Disease       Control.        The greater disease burden among Black people has caused       tremendous loss of life and  [[Page H3750]]       unspeakable suffering across these already vulnerable and       disadvantaged communities. Notably, these effects have also       spilled over and are driving transmission rates of the virus       in the overall population, the study authors said.        Addressing the structural inequalities at the roots of this       disparity through monetary reparations would not only       radically decrease the impact of COVID-19 among the people       who received reparations, tbe authors said, but would reduce       the overall toll of the disease on a broader scale,       benefiting the entire population. The findings, the       researchers said, powerfully underscores the truly global       nature of the pandemic and the notion that a society is only       as strong as its most vulnerable members.        ``If we extrapolate these results to the entire United       States, we can imagine that tens or hundreds of thousands of       lives would have been spared, and the entire nation would       have been saved much of the hardship it has endured in the       last year,'' said Richardson, who is also the chair of the       Lancet Commission on Reparations and Redistributive Justice.        For their analysis, tbe researchers paired sophisticated       data analytics and computational tools with commonly used       epidemiologic modeling methods to calculate the impact of       structural racism on infection rates among Black and white       populations in Louisiana. They chose Louisiana as an exemplar       of the impacts of structural racism in the U.S. because it       was one of the few states that reported infection rates by       race in the early stages of the pandemic. For a control       group, the researchers chose the relatively egalitarian       population of South Korea.        The researchers noted that although modeling is used to       understand many factors in the spread of an infectious       disease, such as differences in infection risk based on       whether passengers on a train sit with windows open or closed       or individual variations in mask-wearinq habits, it has       rarely been used to capture the effects of social factors       that can create vast disparities between populations, such as       those seen between Blacks and whites in the U.S.        Richardson's recent book Epidemic illusions explores the       ways conventional epidemiology is constrained from proposing       solutions that address the root causes of health disparities       derived from the combined weight of centuries of racism,       imperialism, neoliberal politics, and economic exploitation.       One of the goals of the paper is to challenge the narrow ways       people who work in medicine and public health measure and       think about problems and solutions and to broaden the public       imagination, thus opening new conversations about what       challenges and opportunities are worth considering in global       health and social science, Richardson said.        The study examined the initial period of the outbreak,       before infection control measures were implemented, so any       differences in infection rates between populations at that       time would have been driven mainly by differences in the       social structures, the researchers said.        For example, Louisiana has a population heavily segregated       by race, with Black people having higher levels of       overcrowded housing and working jobs that are more likely to       expose them to SARS-CoV-2 than white people. In comparison,       South Korea has a more homogenous population with far less       segregation.        To probe how such structural inequities impact transmission       of SARS-CoV-2, the researchers examined infection rates over       time for the first two months of the epidemic in each       location. During the initial phase of the outbreak in       Louisiana, each infected person spread the virus to 13 to 2.5       more people than an infected individual durinq the same phase       of the outbreak in South Korea, the analysis showed. The       study also showed it took Louisiana more than twice as long       to bring the early wave of the epidemic under control as       South Korea.        Next, the researchers used next-generation matrices to       gauge how overcrowding, segregation, and the wealth gap       between Blacks and whites in Louisiana could have driven       higher infection rates and how monetary reparations would       affect viral transmission.        The model showed that greater equity between Blacks and       whites might have reduced infection transmission rates by       anywhere from 31 percent to 68 percent for every person in       the state.        This research comes at a time when many Americans are       already thinking about the larger societal costs of       structural racism, the researchers said. They noted, for       example, that the nationwide movement to protest police       brutality against Black people has been fueled by many of the       inequitable outcomes exemplified so painfully by the       coronavirus pandemic in the U.S.        ``This moment has made it possible for a lot of people who       had no reason to think about these inequalities to be very       aware of them,'' said study co-author and Lancet reparations       commissioner Kirsten Mullen, who was a member of concept       development team for the National Museum of African American       History and Culture.                            Anti-racism in action         Richardson said that the research was designed to explore       how reparations payments might have altered the trajectory of       the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. and how a different       response to the disease could have helped mitigate the       disparities fueled by social conditions that are vestiges of       slavery. Such conditions, Richardson noted, include ongoing       discrimination and structural racism in the form of       redlining, overcrowding, over-incarceration, and the       heightened use of lethal force in policing experienced by       Black people.        Richardson said that historian and anti-racist scholar       Ibram X. Kendi's description of the differences between       racism and anti-racism were helpful in designing the study.       According to Kendi, a racist policy is any policy that       produces or sustains inequality or promotes the power of one       racial group over another, whereas an anti-racist policy is       any measure that produces or sustains equity between racial       groups.        Richardson said that one important goal of the project was       to attempt to harness the power of mathematical modeling for       an anti-racist response to the coronavirus and beyond.        ``When you look at a formula for transmissibility, it looks       like an objective calculation,'' he said. ``But where is       lethal policing in that formula?''        Richardson noted that it was important to call attention to       the systemic and structural elements of racism that can get       lost in simplified models of disease.                            What are reparations?         Mullen and study co-author William Darity, who recently       published a book on reparations and have written in the press       about the case for using reparation payments to fight COVID-      19, defined reparations as a program of acknowledgement,       redress, and closure for a grievous injustice. In this case,       Mullen said, the atrocities are associated with periods of       enslavement, legal segregation and white terrorism during the       Jim Crow era, and racial strife and violence of the post-      Civil Rights Act era, including ongoing inequities in the       form of over-policing, police executions of unarmed Black       people, ongoing discrimination in regard to incarceration,       access to housing, and, possibly most important, the Black-      white gulf in wealth.        Successful reparations programs include three elements:       admission of culpability on behalf of the perpetrators of the       atrocity; redress, in the form of an act of restitution; and       closure, wherein the victims agree that the debt is paid and       no further claims are to be made unless new harms are       inflicted.        In this case, Mullen said, reparations would take the form       of financial restitution for living Black individuals who can       show that they are descended from at least one ancestor who       was enslaved in the U.S. and that they self-identified as       Black on a legal document at some point during the 12 years       prior.        The financial restitution is designed to help close the       Black-white wealth gap. Darity noted that it is important to       distinguish wealth from income. Wealth is how much you own,       and income is how much you earn. Greater wealth translates to       greater stability for individuals and families across time.       Greater wealth is also more strongly associated with greater       well-being than greater income, Darity said, and disparities       in wealth manifest as health disparities.        Wealth is more strongly associated with familial or       individual well-being,'' said Darity, who is the Samuel       DuBois Cook Distinguished Professor of Public Policy at Duke       University and a Lancet reparations commissioner. He noted       that, according to the Federal Reserve Board 2016 Survey of       Consumer Finances, the average Black household had a net       worth $800,000 lower than the average white household, and       that Black people, who represent 13 percent of the U.S.       population, only own 3 percent of the nation's wealth.        ``This dramatically restricts the ability of Black       Americans to survive and thrive,'' Darity said.        To assess the effect of reparation payments on the       trajectory of the pandemic, the researchers based their       calculations on a model that would pay $250,000 per person or       $800,000 per household to descendants of enslaved       individuals--one of several proposed reparation models.                 Every transmission is a social transmission         ``Every transmission has a social cause,'' said study co-      author and Lancet reparations commissioner James Jones,       associate professor of Earth System Science and a senior       fellow at the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford       University.        For a brief moment when AIDS was in the spotlight during       the late 80s and early 90s, people interested in social       behavior became interested in mathematical modeling of       disease, Jones said. While that interest largely waned, the       COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the need to think about       social science, inequality, social structure, behavior       patterns, and behavior change, as well as how they fit       together with how we understand and respond to epidemics,       Jones said.        Even the simplest model must account for a rudimentary       social structure, Jones said. At its most basic, this can be       represented with a generalized estimate of how likely an       infected person is to come into contact with a susceptible       person. He explained that this number, R0 or ``R-naught,'' is       the average number of people an infected individual transmits       the virus to. When R0 is less than one, no epidemic is       possible because the number of people infected decreases.       When R0 is greater than 1 an epidemic is possible. R0 also       determines the total number of people who could potentially       become infected or how many people would need to be       vaccinated to end the epidemic. It can also be  [[Page H3751]]       used to calculate the so-called endemic equilibrium--which       determines whether a disease will continue to exist within a       population, simmering constantly in the background or       bubbling up seasonally, like influenza.        ``That's the theory of infectious disease control in a       single parameter,'' Jones said.        That seeming simplicity can make it hard to focus on the       complex ways that infectious diseases move through the real       world, the researchers said.        ``It's important to highlight that R0 is not simply a       function of the pathogen,'' Jones said. ``It's a function of       the society.'' Social and environmental factors like       mobility, segregation, and the nature of the built       environment help determine rates of infection, he said.        This is one important reason that diseases don't hit all       people the same. Global R0 is an average of very different       R0s for different groups of people. Some groups are more       likely to interact only with members of their own group, some       groups are more likely to come in contact with infected       people, and some are more susceptible to the disease for       other reasons, Jones said.        In this case, the researchers used mathematical models to       help understand the differences in R0 for Black people and       white people in Louisiana and to help think about how things       would change if racism were less prevalent in America.        Absent those interventions, the researchers noted that       Black Americans remain at an elevated and inequitable risk of       becoming infected and dying during the COVID-19 pandemic and       that this inequity will continue to fuel the pandemic for all       Americans.        ``Increasing equality would have huge benefits on infection       rates for everyone,'' said co-author Momin Malik, who was a       data science postdoctoral fellow at the Berkman Klein Center       for Internet & Society at Harvard University at the time the       study was conducted.        This research was supported by the National Institute of       General Medical Sciences Models of Infectious Disease Agent       Study (grant R01 GM130900), National Institute of Allergy and       Infectious Diseases (grant K08 AI139361), National Institute       of Minority Health Disparities (grant R01 MD011606), National       Science Foundation Division of Social and Economic Sciences       (grant 1851845), Institute of Education Sciences (grant       R305A190484), and the Ethics and Governance of Artificial       Intelligence Fund.     It states: ``Civil rights activists have long called  for monetary reparations,'' this report opens up. This is a scientific,  vetted report from the Harvard University Medical School. It is titled  ``Anti-Racist Epidemiology: Research suggests reparations for slavery  could have reduced COVID-19 infections and deaths in the U.S.'' This  was published online on February 10.   It says: ``To estimate the impact of structural inequities between  Black and White individuals, the researchers set out to capture the  effect of reparation payments on the Black-White wealth gap in the  State of Louisiana.'' This is an important report.   ``The disproportionate effects of COVID-19 on racial minorities-- Black individuals in particular--have been well documented. Black  people get COVID-19 at a rate nearly one-and-a-half times higher than  that of White people, are hospitalized at a rate nearly four times  higher, and are three times as likely to die from the disease,  according to the latest estimates from the U.S. Centers for Disease  Control.   ``The greater disease burden among Black people has caused tremendous  loss of life and unspeakable suffering across these already vulnerable  and disadvantaged communities. Notably, these effects have also spilled  over and are driving transmission rates of the virus in the overall  population.''   They did their study in many places, but I will read a portion. ``The  study examined the initial period of the outbreak, before infection  control measures were implemented, so any differences in infection  rates between populations at the time would have been driven mainly by  differences in the social structures.''   ``Louisiana has a population heavily segregated by race, with Black  people having higher levels of overcrowded housing and working jobs  that are more likely to expose them,'' and they found that if  reparations had been given, they would have done better.   I conclude, Mr. Speaker, by just saying that you see a picture of the  Tulsa race riot. That is why I stand here today to say that Tulsa  Greenwood needs reparation. H.R. 40 needs to pass. Why don't we do it  together?   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
