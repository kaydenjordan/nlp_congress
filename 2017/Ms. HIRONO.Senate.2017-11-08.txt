 Mr. President, Donald Trump has consistently made  promises to the American people that he refuses to keep. He says one  thing and does the exact opposite. His empty promises have already hurt  millions of people across the country, from our seniors who depend on  Medicare and Medicaid, to the LGBTQ community he promised to protect  and Dreamers living in fear of deportation.   Now, with the nomination of Peter Robb to serve as the General  Counsel at the National Labor Relations Board, or NLRB, Donald Trump  has broken yet another promise--this time, to fight for and protect  American workers. As an independent agency, the NLRB has an important  mission to enforce our Nation's labor laws, protect American workers,  and safeguard their right to organize collectively.   The NLRB's mission is not to ignore our Nation's labor laws, to go  after American workers, or to weaken their right to organize. Yet Peter  Robb's career has been dedicated to doing all the things that NLRB is  not about.   Joining the anti-union, anti-worker forces, President Trump has  consistently nominated people to the NLRB who are best positioned to  destroy and undermine the core functions of the agency itself. Earlier  this year, President Trump forced through two management-side lawyers  to create an anti-worker majority on the NLRB.   Today the Senate is debating the nomination of someone who has spent  his entire legal career fighting to screw over the very workers the  NLRB is supposed to protect. If confirmed as General Counsel, Mr. Robb  will be responsible for supervising nearly 1,500 agents investigating  and prosecuting unfair labor practice cases and overseeing elections  where workers decide whether or not to unionize. This is a position  [[Page S7080]]  of great consequence for millions of workers across our country, and  they deserve someone much better than Peter Robb.   Mr. Robb has spent his career defending management and employers from  workers fighting to form a union, unionized workers on strike, and  workers who brought forward discrimination and disability claims. You  don't have to take my word for it. Mr. Robb's biography on his own law  firm's website tells the story clearly:         [His] extensive experience includes advising on mergers/      acquisitions, plant closings, labor contract negotiations       (both large and small), managing lockouts and strikes,       securing labor injunctions, discrimination issues and       disability claims.        His litigation includes defending employers from unfair       labor practice charges, age and sex discrimination charges,       class action age claims, and wage/hour claims as well as       bringing suits against labor organizations. With such vast       experience and a no-nonsense approach, Peter's clients look       to him for sharp advice, rigorous representation and powerful       litigation.    That is a description on his own law firm's website.   Mr. Robb cut his teeth busting unions and retaliating against workers  as lead counsel at the NLRB in the early 1980s when President Reagan  decertified the air traffic controllers union, fired 11,000 air traffic  controllers, and barred them from Federal service. More recently, he  represented Dominion Energy's successful attempt to defeat a union  organizing campaign at a power station in Connecticut.   Management and corporations have a right to hire lawyers like Mr.  Robb who will vigorously represent their interests, but Mr. Robb is  certainly not the right person to lead an agency whose mission is to  protect workers' rights, not to go after those rights tooth and nail.  Mr. Robb's record clearly demonstrates that he will side with powerful  corporations and special interests over workers who lack the resources  to defend themselves.   Unions built the middle class in Hawaii and across our country.  Instead of confirming another management protector at the NLRB, we  should be working together to protect workers and make it fairer for  them to form and to join a union, which is their right.   I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this nominee.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.
