 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a Senate  Resolution calling for the international  [[Page S4825]]  community to come together and determine the ethical limits of gene- editing technology to avoid future misuse like what was recently  discovered in China.   Gene editing is a powerful new technology that has the potential to  lead to new therapies for devastating and previously untreatable  diseases. Today, there are already promising clinical trials using  gene-editing technology that hope to treat cancer, sickle cell disease  and other terrible diseases.   However, like any new technology, there is potential for misuse and  that is what happened with recent experiments in China. These  experiments involving gene-edited human embryos failed in every measure  to meet the ethical and scientific standards for research with human  subjects.   First and foremost, the scientist put the health of the mother and  her children at risk by using an unproven technology without adequate  safeguards.   Furthermore, human clinical research must be conducted for a  legitimate medical purpose. In this case, gene-editing was used to  prevent the children from being able to acquire HIV. There are already  safe and effective ways to prevent HIV infection that do not involve  the use of gene-editing technology.   In addition, clinical research participants should never be misled  when obtaining informed consent. According to reports, the scientist in  charge of the experiments told the participants that the study would be  testing a new vaccine for HIV, which is a gross mischaracterization of  the gene-editing technology.   Finally, the scientist reportedly proceeded with the experiments  knowing the genetic changes he created were different from what he  originally intended. As a result, the children likely possess genetic  mutations that did not undergo any pre-clinical testing and have never  before existed in humans, leaving their long-term health in question.   Moreover, these unethical experiments have the potential to create  new genetic diseases that could be passed down to future generations.   The international community must come together to condemn unethical  human experimentation and prevent this from happening again. No one  country can make this decision alone. International standards must be  established to prevent unethical researchers from moving to whichever  country has the loosest regulations.   Already, the World Health Organization and the United States'  National Academies of Sciences, along with the Chinese Academy of  Sciences, have begun this important work.   Our resolution makes clear that unethical human experimentation has  no place in a modern society and encourages collaborative international  efforts to continue.   I am proud to introduce this resolution today. I hope my Senate  colleagues will join us to ensure that gene-editing research is  conducted in a responsible and ethical manner moving forward. Thank  you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                            ____________________
