 Madam Speaker, I live in southwestern Connecticut, which  is on an artery of this Nation's commerce and economy, and that artery  is clogged. I spend hours when I am traveling around my district in  traffic or worrying that the trains, which move more slowly than they  moved 75 years ago, won't get me to where I need to go.   We have an opportunity in this Chamber, sometime in the next week or  so, of passing a major infrastructure bill, which will alleviate those  problems in my district and around the United States.   The problems in my district are hardly unique, and it is not just  about growth, though every business leader in my district says that  transportation infrastructure is their number one or number two  problem. It is about quality of life.   This infrastructure bill is perhaps a once-in-a-career opportunity to  address and make better the challenges that face each and every one of  our constituents.   Madam Speaker, I urge a vote for the infrastructure bill. It is a  jobs bill. It is a future economic bill. And, of course, it is going to  repair and improve the quality of life for the constituents of everyone  in the Chamber.                            ____________________
