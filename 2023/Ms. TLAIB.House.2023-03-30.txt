 Madam Speaker, I rise today, yet again, to speak about gun  violence in our communities.   I would like to read the words of Troy Forbush, a survivor of last  month's horrific mass shooting at Michigan State University in my home  State. Troy said, ``Seconds after being shot clean through the lung,  two entrance wounds and two exit wounds, laying in a state of shock,  that will never leave my mind and forever haunt me.''  [[Page H1682]]    He continued to say, ``I fell to the ground from my seat and tried to  act as if I were already dead. As he panned the room with his handgun,  I pled for my life and screamed, `Please don't shoot me.' We were met  face to face with pure evil.''   No person, Madam Speaker, or child should ever have to go through  what Troy and the countless others continue to experience in our  country of being gunned down while learning, gunned down while praying,  gunned down while shopping, gunned down, gunned down over and over  again.   This is the reality of the United States of America, where gun  violence is the number one cause of death for our children.   How is this acceptable?   We must pass comprehensive gun reform immediately. Enough of the  bloodshed.                            ____________________
