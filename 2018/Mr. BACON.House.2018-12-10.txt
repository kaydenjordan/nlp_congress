 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of Nebraska's most  dedicated and inspirational leaders. Rita Sanders has served since  November 2010 as the mayor of Bellevue, one of the oldest cities in  Nebraska and home to one of the largest bases in the United States Air  Force, Offutt Air Force Base.   She concludes her service as mayor today, and she has achieved many  heralded results. Mayor Sanders was inducted into the Filipino Asian  American Hall of Fame in 2017 as a testament to her tireless work and  tremendous accomplishments as a Filipino American. In addition, the  adjutant general for the Nebraska National Guard awarded Rita the  Civilian Distinguished Service Medal in March of 2017.   Mayor Sanders was born in Hawaii in 1952. Her father served in the  United States Army and was a Bronze Medal recipient for heroism in  Vietnam. Her mother was originally from Germany. Mayor Sanders is  married to Rick, and they have two grown sons. They are owners of a  very successful business serving the elderly community.   Rita is an outspoken advocate for our servicemembers and has  emphasized and enacted measures to enhance public safety, and community  and family programs, including programs that support our military  families at Offutt. She has served as a longtime board member for the  Offutt Advisory Council and was appointed by Governor Pete Ricketts to  the Commission on Military and Veterans' Affairs for the State of  Nebraska.   Mayor Sanders also embraced the importance of economic development  and community enhancement throughout  [[Page H9771]]  the city starting from the time she served as chairman of Bellevue's  Chamber of Commerce. As mayor, she has worked with other city and State  officials on the Governor's Summit on Economic Development to provide  expertise on areas such as workforce development, new business  recruitment, and tax policy.   On October 14, 2017, Mayor Sanders was inducted into the Chicago  Filipino Asian American Hall of Fame. The consul general of the  Philippines acknowledged Rita's diligent work to facilitate the return  of the historic Balangiga bells which were acquired by U.S. soldiers in  September 1901 and brought to America as tribute of the war they fought  and the losses they suffered.   Leaders of the Filipino Government and Catholic Church hold these  bells as highly significant religious artifacts and expressed their  concerns over the use of them as a war prize. When Mayor Sanders met  with President Duterte earlier this year, she pledged her support to  help retrieve the bells. She was successful in her endeavors and  attended a ceremony at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming where  Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis announced the return of the bells.   We are proud to recognize Mayor Sanders for her monumental  leadership, tireless service, and epic achievements for the city of  Bellevue, the Omaha area, and the State of Nebraska.                            Recognizing Grace Fry     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a young lady in  Nebraska who is a fighter, a fighter against a medically complex  condition known as acute myeloid leukemia, and a fighter to gain  support for H.R. 3325, the Advancing Care for Exceptional Kids Act of  2017, or the ACE Kids Act. That fighter is Grace Fry, who is 11 years  old and is in remission from AML.   Grace was diagnosed with AML when she was 9 years old after dark  bruises started appearing on her shins. Her parents thought the young  ballerina had suffered a dancing mishap, but these bruises grew larger.   Aggressive treatment was started for Grace at Children's Hospital &  Medical Center in Omaha, and her parents, Jeff and Mandy, managed to  maintain a family for their two other children while going through  these treatments. Mandy was able to step away from her job to care for  Grace, and Jeff was able to telecommute. Thanksgiving that year was  spent at the hospital cafeteria, and Grace's sister spent her 16th  birthday at the hospital with her baby sister.                                time  1215    Jeff's job did provide the family with private insurance, but the  loss of Mandy's income and increased travel costs made for a tight  financial situation. Medicaid stepped in to help alleviate the costs  not covered by insurance, such as deductibles and coinsurance.   The ACE Kids Act is designed to improve care for children with  medical complexities who are on Medicaid, while also reducing program  spending. The ACE Kids Act addresses existing challenges facing these  children, identified by families and physicians, including the  provision and coordination of care across multiple providers and  services, and easing access to out-of-State care.   This legislation has strong bipartisan support in both Chambers of  Congress, and I was pleased earlier this year to join 73 other  Republicans and 60 Democrats in working to advance it. Tuesday, the  bill will be up for consideration under suspension of the rules. I  encourage my colleagues to support this legislation tomorrow.   Grace loves all her nurses from Children's Hospital and Medical  Center, which serves the most medically complex children in Nebraska  and the region because of their highly specialized pediatricians and  surgeons. Due to Children's wide footprint, Medicaid plays a  significant role in their patients' lives.   One day, the young fighter known as Grace hopes to become a pediatric  oncology nurse. But until then, she will continue to fight for her  health and fight for support of the ACE Kids Act.                            ____________________
