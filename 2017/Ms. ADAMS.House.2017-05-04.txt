 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   After his latest failed attempt to roll back the ACA, Speaker Ryan  declared to the American people ``ObamaCare is the law of the land.''  Less than 50 days later, Paul Ryan shamefully is going against his word  trying to ram TrumpCare down our throats.   It is an embarrassment that we are wasting taxpayer dollars to again  consider TrumpCare--or as I called it ``Trump don't care''--a reckless  plan that does nothing to make health care better.   TrumpCare gives the rich and big corporations a $600 billion tax  break. It forces families to pay higher premiums and deductions,  placing health care out of their reach. TrumpCare forces seniors to pay  higher costs and changes Medicare as we know it. It strips essential  health benefits and protections for people with preexisting conditions.   What a pitiful display of partisan politics. TrumpCare is so bad,  Republicans have exempted themselves from it. They don't want  TrumpCare. The medical industry doesn't want TrumpCare. Democrats don't  want TrumpCare.   Why don't House Republicans listen?   The people don't want it, and I won't support it.
