 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, for weeks, Democrats repeated the same  refrain: Open the government, and we will negotiate on border security.   On Friday, the government was reopened. Now it is time for Democrats  to honor their promise and work with Republicans to provide adequate  funding to address the security and humanitarian crisis at our border.  The next 3 weeks will be a test of Democrats' seriousness about  legislating. Do they really want to work with Republicans and the  President on solutions? Are they willing to actually negotiate, which  involves both sides making compromises, or are they more interested in  obstruction? That is the question before the House.   Are they in Congress because they actually want to find solutions to  challenges facing our country or are they here to score political  points and oppose everything the President says or does? The answers  should become pretty clear over the next 3 weeks. If Democrats meant  what they said about negotiating on border security, we could produce a  bill that will fulfill our responsibility to protect our borders. Make  no mistake, it is a responsibility. Perhaps our greatest obligation as  Members of Congress is to provide the funding and resources necessary  to keep our Nation secure. No nation can be safe if it doesn't know who  is coming across its borders.   Right now, we are facing a security crisis at our Nation's border.  Tens of thousands of individuals try to cross our southern border  illegally every single month. Illegal drugs flow into this country  through ports of entry and unsecured areas of the border. The holes in  our border security leave us susceptible to illegal entry by gang  members, human traffickers, drug dealers, terrorists, weapons  traffickers, and more. The flood of illegal immigration has also  created a humanitarian crisis. Individuals attempting the journey to  come here illegally are vulnerable to exploitation, illness, and abuse.  Approximately, one out of every three women attempting the journey to  the United States is sexually assaulted. Roughly, 70 percent of  individuals become victims of violence along their way. Illness and  other medical issues are also a serious problem. By failing to  discourage illegal immigration, we are perpetuating this humanitarian  crisis.   I hope, over the next 3 weeks, Democrats will honor their promise and  come to the table on border security legislation in a real way, ready  to engage in genuine negotiation and compromise so we can really  address this crisis at our border.                                     S. 1    Last night, we moved to debate on a package of four bills related to  U.S. policy in the Middle East. The Senate attempted to consider these  bills earlier this month, but Democrats inexplicably chose to block  these bipartisan pieces of legislation on three different occasions-- three times. I am hopeful their decision last night to finally support  consideration of these bills is a good sign that they are ready to turn  to legislating instead of politicking.   The bill package before us this week addresses a number of key  issues.  [[Page S727]]  First, it will further strengthen our relationship with Israel, our  closest ally in the Middle East. It authorizes 10 years of military  assistance funding for Israel and reaffirms our commitment to ensuring  that Israel has better weapons and equipment than its enemies. It will  also foster increased technological cooperation between Israel and the  United States to support the security of both our countries.   This legislation will also strengthen our relationship with another  important ally of ours in the Middle East, and that is the Kingdom of  Jordan. At a time when Jordan is facing security and humanitarian  challenges stemming from the conflict in Syria, it is particularly  important that we reaffirm our commitment to this key ally. This  legislation will also help hold accountable individuals who supported  the atrocities of the Assad regime in Syria. It directs the Treasury  Department to investigate whether the Central Bank of Syria launders  money for the Syrian Government. Finally, this legislation will protect  the rights of State and local governments to decline to do business  with entities that have chosen to boycott Israel.   I am glad we finally moved on to these important bills, and I look  forward to voting for their final passage, hopefully, in the very near  future.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Kansas (Mr. Moran) and the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Paul).
