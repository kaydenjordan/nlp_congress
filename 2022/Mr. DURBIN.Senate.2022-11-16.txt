 Madam President, my office recently received a message  from a woman named Amanda. She lives in Illinois and the Chicagoland  area. She tells me that she and her wife Cally will be celebrating  their fifth anniversary as a married couple. The two of them have  actually been together for 8 years, but after the Supreme Court's 2015  decision in Obergefell, they decided it was time to tie the knot.   That ruling affirmed their love and, just as important, their  constitutional right. The Court declared that their right to marry is a  fundamental liberty under the Constitution--for every American,  regardless of sexual orientation. So in 2017, Amanda and her wife Cally  exercised that right, and today they are the proud parents of two  beautiful young children: a daughter, Austin, and a son, Wren.  [[Page S6729]]    Really, that should be the end of the story. With Obergefell, Amanda  and her wife were guaranteed the same rights as me and my wife, and it  should be the beginning of a new story: a loving couple who can now  focus on their family and taking care of their day-to-day  responsibilities: paying the bills, feeding the kids, navigating life  as working parents.   But, sadly, Amanda and many others are now living in fear. Like  millions of Americans, she is facing the very real prospect that this  Supreme Court could soon rule that her right to marry the person she  loves is not protected by the Constitution. She saw what this radical,  far-right Supreme Court did with the Dobbs decision just a few months  ago, the decision that erased the constitutional right for the women of  America to make their own reproductive health choices; and now she and  Cally are wondering: Will they come for our rights to marry next?   Amanda wrote to my office:         Justice Clarence Thomas, in his concurring opinion in       [Dobbs] . . . wrote that the court ``should reconsider all of       this Court's substantive due process precedents, including       Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell.''    She said:         For the first time in our history, Americans are facing the       loss of civil rights--    by this Supreme Court.         Our two young children are growing up in a world where they       may, [and] in some cases [do], have less rights--    fewer rights--       than their parents and grandparents.    Amanda tells me she and her wife are taking every legal step they can  to ``ensure that our recognition as parents to our own children cannot  be challenged. This is emotionally and financially taxing,'' she said,  ``and yet, something that we feel we must do.''   There are more than 700,000 married same-sex couples in America,  couples like Amanda and Cally, whose love and legal status were  recognized under the law and protected by a Supreme Court decision in  Obergefell; couples who, along with their friends and families, are  demanding the Senate do what we should have done years ago: codify  marriage equality.   We can put their minds at ease before Justice Thomas and the far- right majority even have a chance to rip away yet another fundamental  freedom. And this is not an abstract exercise. Early next month, the  Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a case called 303 Creative  LLC v. Elenis. It is a case that, apparently, is concerned with free  speech, involving a website designer in Colorado who wants to build  wedding websites but with the disclaimer that proudly announces she  will not build websites for same-sex couples.   She sued the State of Colorado, demanding the right to boast about  her plans to discriminate against LGBTQ Americans. Such a disclaimer  would violate a State's civil rights law, which prohibits business from  discriminating or intending to discriminate against someone on the  basis of their sexual orientation.   If the Supreme Court's last term and the Dobbs decision are any  indication, this radical far-right majority on the Court could very  well use this case to start the erosion of protections of LGBTQ  Americans. It is exactly the kind of judicial activism that we have  come to expect from this current Court's conservative majority.   Remember when they boasted about the fact that Donald Trump was going  to put on three Justices who would rule his way in future cases? It was  pretty clear from that day forward that the Supreme Court had a  political bent. The Federalist Society had to give its stamp of  approval.   The Federalist Society is a multimillion-dollar political arm of the  Republican Party. And before any judicial nominee had a chance in my  Senate Judiciary Committee under the Republican days, they had to get  the approval of the Federalist Society.   The Federalist Society, from the start, was setting out to eliminate  a woman's right to choose. They had their victory in the Dobbs  decision.   But the American people spoke on November 8. Overwhelmingly, they  said across America: You can't get away with eliminating rights already  established under the Constitution for any American.   I hope that that sentiment grows and, eventually, we reverse the  Dobbs decision.   What we have seen is exactly the kind of judicial activism we can  come to expect from the Court's conservative majority. They twist the  law and set aside longstanding precedent to establish the policies they  prefer.   It is not the Supreme Court's role to make the laws. How many times  have we heard that speech from Republicans? We don't want judicial  activists, they say. That job of making the laws belongs in Congress.   And today we can defend families like Amanda's by voting for the  Respect for Marriage Act, which passed just a few moments ago here on  the floor of the Senate with a strong bipartisan vote.   It will protect marriage equality under the Federal law, not just for  LGBTQ couples but also interracial couples, whose rights could also be  in peril by the Court's far right majority.   The issue of marriage equality is too important to get bogged down in  partisanship, which is why this bill is a bipartisan compromise. I hope  that getting 60 votes for the Respect for Marriage Act is going to be  an indication of more cooperation to guarantee that Amanda and Cally do  not have to lose sleep over the future that they have as loving  individuals married to one another and parents.   In last week's election, the American people sent a clear message to  Washington and to the Senate: Get it together. Work together. No more  toxic culture wars. No more divisive rhetoric. No more Big Lie. Enough.   If you want to stand for family values, let's start by enacting  protections for every family in America. We can do it, certainly, with  the Respect for Marriage Act, and even more.   To Amanda and Cally, I would like to say, happy fifth anniversary. I  hope that by the time your sixth anniversary comes around, you won't  even have to think twice about whether your rights are secure.                                     RSV     Madam President, as we head into the holiday season,  parents and doctors nationwide are concerned about a dramatic surge in  an illness called RSV, a respiratory virus. It can be especially  serious for children and older Americans.   As a parent, there is no more terrifying or helpless feeling than  knowing that your baby is sick. I know. I lived it.   Caitlyn Berg experienced that fear recently, too, when her 6-month- old daughter became ill with RSV and was struggling to breathe. The  Bergs live in Mount Zion, IL, a small town downstate, near Springfield.  Caitlyn Berg scoured the area looking for a hospital that would cure  her sick daughter. After many frantic calls, she finally decided  Springfield was the closest town with a hospital. She took her baby  there and waited 8 hours in the emergency room before a bed finally  opened up for her daughter.   Caitlyn Berg, incidentally, is a pediatrician. If a pediatrician has  to struggle to find hospital care for her own sick infant, imagine the  panic and fear other parents feel when their babies are struggling to  breathe because of RSV. And it isn't just a problem in small towns or  rural America.   Chicago is the third largest city in our country, with some of the  best hospitals in the world, including some of the very best children's  hospitals. The rate of emergency room visits for young children with  RSV is now 10 times higher than in 2019--10 times higher than a normal  season 3 years ago.   This chart demonstrates that. Look at this spike. As you can see, the  number of children admitted for RSV has skyrocketed. In Chicago alone,  there are hundreds of new cases each week, and nearly a dozen kids each  day are being hospitalized.   Earlier this month, Comer Children's Hospital at the University of  Chicago was full, with no beds for 53 straight days. And Lurie  Children's Hospital of Chicago is also running at full capacity.  Ninety-five percent of pediatric ICU beds across Illinois are full  during this time.   This crush on pediatric hospitals isn't limited to Illinois. Over the  border in Franklin, IN, little Ophelia--you can see her here in the  bed--struggled to breathe after contracting RSV at preschool. She went  to the local hospital, and they transferred her to the  [[Page S6730]]  large children's hospital in Indianapolis, where she was intubated for  5 days. Thankfully, she is home safely now and recovered.   Across the country, children's hospitals are being pushed to the  limit, caring for infants, toddlers, and young kids sickened by RSV. In  extreme cases, kids and babies may require ventilators to breathe.   The timing of this surge in RSV is especially concerning, coming from  the worst flu season in a decade and while new COVID variants are  circulating. Those three viral variants together pose what many health  professionals argue could be a ``triple-demic'' of viral illness. So  let's look for solutions.   The Children's Hospital Association and the American Academy of  Pediatrics has asked this President to issue an emergency declaration  to free up more resources. I support them.   At the top of the list, America desperately needs more nurses, more  doctors, more staff. Hospitals plagued with worker shortage even before  COVID now have a pandemic that made the crisis even worse. If our  children's hospitals had more staff, they could immediately open more  beds to treat the kids.   Congress made some headway in the American Rescue Plan, which passed  on the floor of the Senate without the support of a single Republican  Senator. It included my provision to invest $1 billion in the National  Health Service Corps for scholarships and loan repayments for new  nurses and doctors who serve in urban and rural areas in need.   But we need to do more to end the healthcare worker shortage.  Senators Menendez, Boozman, and Schumer have a bipartisan plan, which I  support. It increases funding for medical residency slots to train the  next generation of doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals. I  support putting that plan in the end-of-the-year package we will  consider in the next few weeks.    It is also critical that we fund our public health system adequately  and provide for data collection so we can track RSV. The HELP Committee  has been working on this priority, and I certainly support their  efforts.   We are all in this together. The hospitals are doing their best.  Doctors and nurses are working extra-long shifts to keep kids safe. We  all need to do our part, too. For all of us, that means staying home  when we are sick, still washing our hands, getting COVID booster and  flu shots. For those of us in Congress, it also means providing the  resources to get safely through this current surge of RSV and building  the strong public health infrastructure that American families require.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 5111         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
