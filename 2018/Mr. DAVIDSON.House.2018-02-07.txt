 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my support for H.R.  1153, the Mortgage Choice Act. This bill is another example of a  rollback of the burdensome regulations of Dodd-Frank and, many would  say, unintended consequences.   The 113th Congress, as Mr. Huizenga reported out--apparently, the  Member opposed feels that her colleagues were  [[Page H912]]  confused in the 113th Congress when they unanimously supported this  very same procedure, this same change to Dodd-Frank. Apparently, all of  President Obama's supporters were also confused into forgetting to make  the big investments they have made as a reaction to the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act that was recently enacted. So confusion must be rampant, but  let me clarify what this does.   It doesn't do the things that the Member opposed accuses it of doing.  Frankly, the market prevails here, not price controls from Washington,  D.C., nor a substitute that would say a nonaffiliated company could  offer the exact same product that the one-stop shop is barred from  offering.   So rather than have a simple procedure where a borrower could work  with one lending institution, they are forced to this array that  resembles the healthcare industry, where, instead of getting one bill  from one visit, you show up to do a mortgage and you get a bill from  five or six different entities, and it makes it more confusing.   The market lets people shop and say, ``Hey, maybe I could get this  product from someone else,'' but, unfortunately, without this change,  it blocks hardworking families from working with one relationship to  close on their mortgage. It adds one more piece in the web of  documentation required, and it adds one more thing to negotiate in the  relationship that is necessary to close on a mortgage.    The QM rule should not stand for ``quitting mortgages.'' It should  stand for ``qualified mortgages.'' The application of this has resulted  in small and community banks quitting the mortgage market for certain  types of loans, and this is hurting the families that the Member  opposed says she seeks to help.   I urge all of my colleagues to unite and support this rational,  limited modification that lets the market work the way the market can  work for the hardworking families of America.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Try as they may, they cannot explain to anyone why it is they want to  open up the opportunity for these affiliated companies to charge more  on these title loans.   As a matter of fact, again, I am going to keep reminding everyone who  is listening that, under Dodd-Frank, under the work of the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau, under the qualified mortgage rule, all of  the work that was done after this country found itself in a position of  where we were in a recession, almost a depression because of what we  had allowed to happen in this country from some of the biggest banks  and financial institutions in the world, we discovered that there were  all kind of exotic loans, all kind of different kinds of loans that  were put together to entice consumers and home buyers to take out these  mortgages.   We heard about all of them: no-documentation loans where they didn't  even know where the consumer, the homeowner was going to get their  money from; they did not vet them, they did not know their employment  history, and on and on and on.   So the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is absolutely carrying  out the work of what Dodd-Frank was intended to do, and that is to  reform all of this and to make sure that consumers are treated fairly,  to make sure that consumers are not ripped off, to make sure that  consumers don't have a whole list of these fees and points before they  can even get their downpayments, incredibly, and have to pay over 3  percent and more in these points and fees as they are trying to access  a mortgage.                                time  1000    This is all about keeping the cap on the 3 percent for all of those  points and fees. If you do what this bill is intended to do, you are  saying that you are opening up the opportunity for these points and  fees to be increased because of these affiliated companies that want to  take the cap off. I don't know how better to explain that.   My friends on the opposite side of the aisle would charge consumers  more with this bill. We on this side of the aisle are opposed with  that. We are saying that it is not fair to consumers. What you need to  do is let Dodd-Frank reforms work so that we can protect our consumers  and not have them gouged and increase the amount of money they have to  pay in these points and fees.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
