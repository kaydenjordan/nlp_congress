 Madam Speaker, after 9/11, President Bush never once  called terrorism a Muslim virus or an Arab virus or a Saudi virus. He  made clear that the enemy was not the place where the terrorists came  from or the people who lived there, but terrorism itself. He did that  because it was right and because he knew that equating the evil of al- Qaida with an entire faith or nationality or country was exactly what  our enemies wanted.   So today, when prominent people in our country, whether they are  Republicans or Democrats, or anybody in the media, encourage Americans  to call COVID the ``China virus,'' language that seems to blame this  pandemic on a country and a people, they are not only doing something  wrong, something that has already encouraged violence and  discrimination against Asian Americans, they are playing right into the  hands of a Chinese Communist Party that wants Asian Americans to feel  unwanted and unsafe in America.   Now, if you want to blame this on the Chinese Government, sign me up.  If you want to blame them or anybody else for lying to the American  people, sign me up. But if you are going to give this virus a  nationality, you are doing something wrong. And if you don't see the  difference between those two things, then you don't understand what is  going on in this country in this moment of division, this moment of  danger that we face.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to support this resolution condemning anti-  [[Page H4500]]  Asian rhetoric in any form. I ask my colleagues to vote for it, and I  urge them to live up to it.
