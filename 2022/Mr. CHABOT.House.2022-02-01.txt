 Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening along with several of my  Ohio colleagues to honor the life of a great Ohio Congressman, Clarence  ``Bud'' Brown, Jr., who sadly passed away last Wednesday at the age of  94.   Congressman Brown represented the people of Ohio's Seventh District  with great distinction from 1963 through 1983. As ranking member of the  House Energy and Power Subcommittee, Congressman Brown crafted  legislation to help his constituents and the American people overcome  the 1970s energy crisis.   Congressman Brown hailed from an impressive Ohio family. His father  represented the Seventh District for 27 years in Congress. His son,  Clarence ``Clancy'' Brown, III, is an actor who has appeared in many  movies, including Shawshank Redemption, but is probably best known to  American parents as the voice of Mr. Krabs in SpongeBob SquarePants;  and Congressman Brown's nephew, Zac Haines, currently serves on Miami  University of Ohio's board of trustees.   Mr. Speaker, I respectfully request that all Members keep Congressman  Brown's family and loved ones in their prayers as they mourn this  profound loss. I would ask for a moment of silence in his honor.                            ____________________
