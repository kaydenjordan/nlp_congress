 Madam Speaker, the CHIPS and Science Act is critical  legislation to ramp up American production of semiconductor chips.   Our economy relies on these chips, which are key components in  everything from cell phones to cars to advancing national security  measures.   By increasing production here in America, we will onshore a critical  capability, reduce dependence on foreign manufacturers, and lower costs  for hardworking families.   The United States invented the semiconductor chip. We used to make 40  percent of the world's chips. Now, we make 12 percent, leaving key  industries vulnerable to foreign interference. It is high time we  counter the threat posed by countries like China and Russia and bring  this industry home.   The CHIPS and Science Act does just that, and this investment helps  North Carolina chip manufacturers, including Qorvo and IQE, major  employers in my home district, to ramp up production and create good- paying jobs.   Madam Speaker, I proudly cast my vote to send the CHIPS Act to the  President's desk. I am ready to see this legislation work for North  Carolinians and for the country.                            ____________________
