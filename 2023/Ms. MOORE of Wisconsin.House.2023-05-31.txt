 Mr. Speaker, Republicans claim they just had  to threaten the economic well-being of every American man, woman, and  child because the $31 trillion debt was too high.   Well, hypocrisy, thou hast a name, GOP. Because what they insisted  on, their red line was not financial at all; it was to double down on  the so-called ``work requirements.'' Thank God the White House  negotiations pushed back on the worst of these changes in TANF that  would have saved $6 million over 10 years.   Speaker after speaker has insisted on denying food to poor, old women  who are primarily Black and Brown. It seems like the pound of flesh  that you get is more delicious than having savings, but just wait.  Before the ink is dry on this bill, you will be pushing for $3.5  trillion in business tax cuts. Hear my words. You heard it here first.
