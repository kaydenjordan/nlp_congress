 Mr. Speaker, just this year, I remember John urging  Americans to ``get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem  the soul of America,'' as we combat some of the most hateful messages  and priorities driven by this current administration.   Today, I stand here and, John, I promise that I will continue to  carry out your legacy, to get into good trouble and to ensure that the  fight for equality and justice lives on, and to challenge my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle to do the same and pass the Voting Rights  Act.   John, rest in peace. Rest in power. You have been a good and faithful  servant.
