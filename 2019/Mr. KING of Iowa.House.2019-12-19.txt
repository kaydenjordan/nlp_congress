 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Brady), the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, and  perhaps one of the most successful in modern time.   I am looking at this USMCA trade agreement. I said from the beginning  that I would not have opened up NAFTA; it was good for Iowa  agriculture, it was good for Iowa manufacturing, it was good for  America in many areas. But the President promised that he would open it  up and that he would prevail in his negotiations.   He has followed through and he has kept his word.   For a year and a half I have been having discussions with every  entity that I can find that has been affected by this trade agreement.  They all say, We are better off. They might say, We are marginally  better off, but they say, We are better off, until you get to dairy,  where we are a lot, lot better off than we were in the past.   This is a terrific trade agreement.   Whatever the nuances were afterwards where there were some changes  that didn't affect, I don't think, the district that I represent, what  this amounts to is this: It is a huge victory for the President of the  United States, for Americans everywhere, for Iowans in the Fourth  Congressional District, which is the number one agriculture producing  district in all of America.   We are happy. We are delighted. We are thankful to have this  Christmas present coming to us.   We say, Merry Christmas, Mr. President; Merry Christmas, America.
