 Madam Speaker, the President has engaged  in conduct that is criminal, impeachable, and profoundly threatening to  our democracy.   He pressed State officials and Members of this body to overturn a  legitimate election and to keep him in power. He then invited and  activated a violent mob to invade the Capitol and achieve his desired  result by insurrection.   If that is not impeachable conduct, I don't know what is. The  President must be removed from office immediately and never allowed to  hold office again. Our democracy requires it.   Madam Speaker, the president has engaged in conduct that is criminal,  impeachable, and profoundly threatening to our democracy.   He has sought to overturn an election to keep himself in office and  to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.   He has done this by perpetrating a big lie, despite counts and  recounts and dozens of judicial rulings, and has pressed state  officials and members of this body to reject and reverse popular and  electoral vote outcomes.   He then invited and activated a violent mob of right-wing extremists,  domestic terrorists, and white nationalists to invade the Capitol and  achieve his desired result by insurrection.   If that is not impeachable conduct, I don't know what is.   The President must be removed from office immediately and must never  be allowed to seek office again, and a marker must be laid down for all  time as to what the Constitution and our democracy require.
