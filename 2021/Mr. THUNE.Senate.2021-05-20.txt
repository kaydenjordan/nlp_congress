 Mr. President, the recent Colonial Pipeline hack, which  saw more than 15,000 gas stations run out of fuel and drove gas prices  to their highest level in almost 7 years, was a timely reminder of the  importance of cyber security.   In today's world, where almost everything we do has a cyber  component, cyber security has to be a priority. Companies have to  prioritize it to keep their systems, services, and customer information  secure. State governments have to prioritize it, and the Federal  Government has to prioritize it. Cyber security is a crucial part of  our national defense, and it is vital that we keep security systems and  data secure.   The Colonial Pipeline hack was also a timely reminder of something  else, and that is the importance of maintaining our energy security via  energy independence.   As Americans panicked over gas shortages from the Colonial shutdown,  gas stations saw lines that harkened back to the 1970s, when conflict  in the Middle East and an oil embargo resulted in serious shortages  here at home.   Since then, the United States has, to a greater or lesser extent,  worked to become energy independent; in other words, to make sure that  we are able to rely almost entirely on North American energy sources  instead of imports from overseas and to make sure that American  consumers never have to question whether they will have reliable and  affordable access to energy and fuel.   We have made a lot of progress on that front, but it requires  continued commitment and investment. It also requires an ``all of the  above'' energy policy that pursues investment in everything from oil  and natural gas, to ethanol and other biofuels, to solar, wind, and  hydropower. Unfortunately, Democrats are increasingly minimizing the  oil and natural gas part of that equation.   I am a longtime advocate of clean energy and clean fuels, but the  fact is that our economy is still going to need traditional sources of  energy--namely, oil and natural gas--for a long time to come. I don't  expect airplanes or freight trains to be running on electricity or  solar power anytime in the near future. Fortunately, as technology has  advanced, it has become easier and easier to explore for, extract, and  transport oil and natural gas in an environmentally responsible way.   It is vital that we continue to develop domestic oil and gas  resources so that, down the road, we don't find ourselves again relying  on oil from the Middle East, Venezuela, or other unstable areas of the  world. That is why it was so disappointing that one of President  Biden's first actions as President was to pause new leases for oil and  gas production on Federal lands and offshore.   Oil and gas production on public lands and offshore is an essential  part of the U.S. domestic energy supply, accounting for 22 percent of  domestic oil production and 12 percent of domestic gas production in  2019. Only a tiny percentage of public land is used for production, but  the resulting oil and natural gas is significant.   Halting new oil and gas drilling could jeopardize the stability of  our affordable energy supply, and it would definitely jeopardize the  hundreds of thousands of American jobs that are supported by this  industry, not to mention the billions of dollars of revenue that oil  and gas development disburses to States and to Federal programs like  the Land and Water Conservation Fund.   Another early and discouraging sign of President Biden's hostility to  affordable and reliable energy security came when he halted  construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline on the first day of his  Presidency. That one hit particularly close to home since the pipeline  would have run through nine counties in South Dakota and brought  economic growth to small towns like Philip and Murdo.   The Keystone XL Pipeline has to be the most studied project,  literally, in the history of our Nation, probably in the history of the  world, and it has been pretty conclusively demonstrated that the  pipeline would provide an environmentally responsible way of  [[Page S3177]]  transporting oil from Canada and the Bakken oilfields in Montana and  North Dakota to refineries on the gulf coast.   The Obama administration--that is right, the Obama administration-- concluded that the pipeline provided the most environmentally sensitive  way of transporting the oil. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a  staunch liberal, included the pipeline in Canada's clean energy plan.  On top of all that, the pipeline's owner committed to offsetting the  pipeline's operations with $1.7 billion in renewable energy investment.   But none of that mattered to leftist environmentalists, who fixed on  Keystone XL as a proxy for their opposition to oil. It is difficult to  think of a more counterproductive crusade. Thanks to their efforts, oil  that would have been transported via the pipeline will now be  transported by rail or truck--more environmentally hazardous methods of  travel, which, incidentally, will also produce far more emissions-- emissions that will likely not be offset by a renewable energy  investment.   I haven't even mentioned the cost to people's livelihoods. The  cancelation of the pipeline will end up costing 11,000 American jobs,  most of them those good union jobs the President keeps talking about.  It also means that Americans will not see lower prices at the pump as a  result of the efficiencies of the pipeline, which is particularly  frustrating at a time when prices are rising. But when you are pursuing  an ideological crusade, I guess all that doesn't matter.   I find it particularly fascinating--or maybe more accurately,  troubling--that the President canceled the Keystone XL Pipeline and its  11,000 American jobs yet is conceding to Russia--Russia--on the  construction of a Russian pipeline, Nord Stream 2, by waiving sanctions  against the Russian company constructing the pipeline. Think about  that. The irony. Of course, the President has more direct authority  over pipelines here in the United States, but the President is taking a  notably new position.   The successful construction of Nord Stream 2 will further isolate  Ukraine and deny the country billions in revenue as it defends against  Russian aggression, and it will make our allies more dependent on  Russia's energy monopoly for their energy supplies.   The President has talked aggressively about countering Putin and  Russian aggression, and his Secretary of State has talked explicitly  about the importance of halting the construction of Nord Stream 2. But  now, with a chance to do something about halting the construction of  the pipeline, the President is taking the pressure off, even though the  President himself has correctly called the pipeline ``a fundamentally  bad deal'' for Europe   It is deeply troubling that our European allies may soon be relying  on Russia for an increased portion of their energy needs. Yet it is  another reminder of the need to make sure that the United States is not  dependent on bad actors anywhere in the world for our oil or any other  energy resource.   I hope the Biden administration will end its embargo on new oil and  gas leases and think about pursuing an energy policy that embraces not  only environmentalists' pet energy projects but all--all--important  energy sources. It is no exaggeration to say that our very national  security depends on it.   I yield the floor.
