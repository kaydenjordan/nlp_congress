 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that Members have 5  legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, cancel culture is a dangerous phenomenon, the  total silencing and erasing of people and truths the progressives  dislike.   Americans are beginning to see what cancel culture is really about. A  recent survey found that 64 percent of Americans now believe cancel  culture is a threat to freedom.   Cancel culture aims not only to cancel certain elements of society  but to replace them. Consider the following: for years, the political  left has attempted to erase parts of our American history, especially  our founding and the story of 1776.   Why?   Because their goal is replacement. In place of America's true  history, the progressives want to push the 1619 Project. This false  narrative presents students with an alternate history and an alternate  reality that our Nation was founded not on the principles outlined in  the Declaration of Independence but instead on a racist pursuit of  expanding slavery. Canceling 1776 makes sense only in the broader  context of this effort to advance a false narrative.   Other areas of curriculum are being canceled in favor of critical  race theory. Just last week, the Biden administration announced that it  will use taxpayer funds to push critical race theory in public schools  across the Nation. Critical race theory is the backdoor way to teach  Marxism to students and adults in this country under the guise of  pushing equity.   In my State of Colorado, the oil and gas industry is being canceled.   The goal?   Replace it with Green New Deal objectives.   Schools named after our Founders must be renamed after liberal icons  according to the left. Professors and journalists who will not kowtow  to the progressive agenda find themselves replaced in their jobs.   Our list of examples could go on.   I am joined tonight by my colleagues who wish to help expose cancel  culture. The examples we will highlight touch on all aspects of cancel  culture, but they all have one thing in common: in each instance,  progressives seek to cancel, cut, censor, and silence so they can move  to the next phase: replacement culture.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs), who  is my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Foxx) for a slightly different purpose. She will tell us about a very  sad circumstance in her home State of North Carolina.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina  for her comments, and I assure her that our thoughts and prayers are  with her and the families of those who have fallen.   I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas, and I appreciate  the points that he made.   I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Green).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his impassioned  remarks and great research. We could all learn a lot from that. I  appreciate it very much.   I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cloud).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for not naming my home  State as he was talking about the All-Star Game.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Tiffany), and I thank him for joining us in this Special Order hour.     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I suggest he is in  the wrong line of work. That was great. I thank him very much for that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Clyde).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Donalds).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his profound  remarks. I now yield to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. Cheney), my  friend and my neighbor to the north.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman, and I inform the  Speaker that we have no further speakers. I yield back the balance of  my time.                            ____________________
