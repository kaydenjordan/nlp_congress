 Mr. Chairman, I stand in support and the  Hispanic Caucus stands in support of H.R. 3239.   We had an opportunity, not too long ago, to visit rural New Mexico  and Antelope Wells, a forward operating base, and another Border Patrol  station. It became very clear to Dr. Ruiz, and to all of us, that the  Border Patrol is not prepared for medical emergencies that migrants may  encounter or that their own agents may encounter.   Something must be done. These folks are not livestock. They are not  animals. They shouldn't be treated in a subhuman way.   Mr. Chairman, this bill establishes minimum standards for humane  care, and I, wholeheartedly, support it.
