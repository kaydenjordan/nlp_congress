 Madam Speaker, increased voter participation  should be the goal of every legislator, Republican or Democrat.  Anything less is a betrayal of our democratic ideal.   Madam Speaker, 4 million more Latino voters cast a ballot in 2020  than in 2016. Native Americans defied the devastation of COVID to come  out and vote in higher numbers. And now, States across our country are  trying to turn away these citizens.   H.R. 1 is necessary, now more than ever, to protect the rights of  every citizen to register, to vote absentee, or by mail if you live on  a reservation or just work on Tuesdays.   We brought New Mexico's experience to this bill to improve voting  access for Native Americans, respect Tribal land boundaries during  redistricting, and reduce wait times at the polls.   Our democracy is the very foundation on which we rest every American  ideal. We love it, and we must protect it for the people.
