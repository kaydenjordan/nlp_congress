 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to  H.R. 2740, which advocates for funding for the Department of  Education's comprehensive literacy development grants.   The LEARN Program provides competitive grants to States to help local  educational agencies develop comprehensive literacy plans to ensure  high-quality instruction and evidence-based intervention strategies for  all students from birth through grade 12.   This program is the only Federal funding stream to support these  statewide efforts. This funding allows local school districts to  support high-quality professional development for teachers, teacher  leaders, principals, and specialized instructional support personnel to  improve literacy instruction for struggling readers and writers,  including English language learners and students with disabilities.   The state of literacy in our country is alarming. Before coming to  Congress, I taught high school chemistry, and what I found was that  most of my high school students couldn't read above a third or fourth  grade level.   How could my students learn chemistry if they couldn't read? How  could they expect to, later in life, be able to pursue a quality and  rewarding life?   It was a wake-up call for me, and I spent the next 4 years, as a  consequence, building a nonprofit that focused on early childhood  literacy in our most disadvantaged communities.   According to the National Institute of Literacy, approximately 32  million adults in the U.S. cannot read. The Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development found that half of U.S. adults cannot read  a book written at an eighth grade level.   The fight for a more literate America is crucial, and we must  acknowledge that low literacy more dramatically affects communities of  color.   On the most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress, in  the 12th grade reading level assessments, 46 percent of White students  scored at or above proficient, while only 25 percent of Latino and 17  percent of Black students scored proficient. In essence, the fight for  literacy is a fight for a fairer country, for a more level playing  field.   How can we expect young Americans from every race, gender, and  socioeconomic background to be ready for our workforce?                                time  0945    How can we be living up to the notion that every American deserves a  shot at the American Dream if we are not aggressively fighting to  ensure that they have the most fundamental ability to read.   Our inaction is costing us all. The National Council for Adult  Learning estimates that low literacy costs our country $225 billion  each year in nonproductivity in the workforce, crime, and loss of tax  revenue due to unemployment.   The American Journal of Public Health found that in excess of $230  billion a year in healthcare costs is linked to low adult literacy. Our  inaction on literacy is costing us nearly $500 billion a year. I  believe, and I am sure that many of my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle believe, that every American child deserves his or her shot at  the American Dream, at the ability to get a quality education, and to  make a living wage to support themselves and their families.   We are denying millions of people their shot and their promise in  this country by refusing to more aggressively advocate for and fund  programs that do the critical work of increasing our literacy levels.   I am thankful that my amendment is being considered. I think it is an  important first step in the long overdue fight for a more literate and,  by extension, a more fair America. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).    Madam Chairwoman, I am nearly speechless with the  conversation that I have just heard where we are talking about the most  fundamental of things that we need, the equipment that we need to be  functioning in our society, that skill of literacy, that we are  thinking somehow that this is a checkbook balance situation rather than  an investment in a child, an investment in a family, an investment in a  future.   If we are talking about the need to imagine, we have to give people  the skills so that they may imagine. Imagine the life that they will be  able to have when they are able to read a street sign; when they are  able to read to their child; when they are able to read their driver's  test. These are things that we should not deny anyone. These are  fundamental things that we absolutely have to provide to every single  citizen in our economy.   If we are not providing education and literacy, what good is this  Nation? I will conclude by saying that I came here to Congress and I  stand on this floor, the daughter of a refugee from Poland. He came  here with nothing as a 5 year old. He came here with no literacy  skills, and a generation later, I am standing here in front of you  because my father had the opportunity to learn to read.   My father had the opportunity to pursue the American Dream, and 70  years later, I stand here in front of you because that is the promise  that our Nation makes to all of us and the investment that our Nation  makes in every one of us.    I very much appreciate the opportunity to speak about something that  I am deeply passionate about. I am confident that the vast majority of  our Nation is deeply passionate about this, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
