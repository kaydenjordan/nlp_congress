 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments from the gentleman  from Arizona. As he so often does, in outlining the extent to which we  have significant fiscal challenges that could be met with the kinds of  reforms that we don't often talk about: the need to reform healthcare  policies, healthcare decisions, and things that get well beyond the  rhetoric of balancing budgets, on that he and I agree enormously.   I look forward to engaging with him on the floor of the House and  other places on that topic again. But I do want to say one thing that  is true about what the gentleman from Arizona was talking about with  respect to addressing mandatory spending, reforming so-called  entitlements with respect to Social Security and Medicare, and  otherwise reforming those complex areas of our government. If you can't  tackle discretionary spending, you are  [[Page H199]]  not going to tackle mandatory spending.   And importantly, this is the critical part, you have got to have the  political willpower to address these things. That is actually why I  came to the floor this evening.                                time  1745    America was drawn into an engaging debate among the Members of  Congress who represent them in the people's House last week.   C-SPAN, not constricted by the rules of the House, was able to have  cameras zeroing in on the Members of this body as we were debating last  week. People were drawn into the conversations, the people on both  sides of the aisle, on the drama of the debates and how we would choose  the Speaker of the House and then whether we would pass the rules  package.   But here I am on January 11, 2023, in the new Republican majority,  and I am alone in the Chamber again with the Speaker. That is the  requirement, by the way. There has to be a Speaker and then a Member on  the floor. But I am alone again.   Now, we passed some bills today.   But what are we going to do as a body to make good on the reforms we  passed last week and actually extend on them and build on them?   I would ask my colleagues why we don't have full debate right now on  a number of the important issues of the day?   Why we don't have full debate tomorrow, next week, and the following  week on the crucial issues of our day?   Today, I called a colleague on the other side of the aisle to inquire  as to which Members of the minority party would be willing to sit down  with me and anybody else to figure out how to deal with the debt and  the deficit spending that is plaguing our country.   My colleague on the other side of the aisle engaged in conversation  about what that would take, but the fact of the matter is that I don't  know the answer.   What I would say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle is:  Come on down. Where are you?   Are you going to simply take potshots at any effort by Members of my  side of the aisle--the majority now--who dare to raise questions about  how we might tackle $32 trillion of debt, a trillion dollar-plus  deficits every year, and tackle the question of interest rates going up  causing our interest payments to go up every year?   Every 50 basis points--every half of a percentage point--that goes up  adds about $100 billion a year in additional interest expense. I think  in the next year interest is going to eclipse our national defense  spending.   Now, where are all my defense hawks?   Where are all of my Republican colleagues who like to stand up and  say: We have got to fund our men and women in uniform; we have to buy  more planes and more bombers; we have to have more guns; and we have to  make sure we have the strongest defense in the world?   Great. I agree. Peace through strength sparingly used, non-woke, and  trained to kill people and blow things up. That is what I want our  military to be and to do, and I want it to continue to be the best in  the world.   But we are not going to be able to do that if we are spending more on  interest to the debt than we are on our own national defense.   As the gentleman from Arizona rightly is pointing out about the state  of our ``mandatory spending'' and ``entitlements,'' we are not going to  be able to maintain our country, have a strong national defense, and  ensure a peaceful world for our children and our grandchildren. These  are just facts.   We used to have a lot of political back and forth between Democrats  and Republicans. We would accuse our colleagues on the other side of  the aisle of being tax-and-spend Democrats--and they were tax-and-spend  Democrats. But something changed along the way. We stopped debating tax  policy for the most part, and now everybody in this Chamber for the  most part are spend-and-spend Members of Congress, spend-and-spend  members of a uni-party.   Mr. Speaker, I am all on board with the enthusiasm, the unity, and  the energy coming out of last week that we are going to transform this  institution. I believe it.   I believe by offering amendments in the appropriations process on the  floor of this body we will be better.   I believe that by having 72 hours to read bills and not waiving that  rule--that we actually do it--that we will be better.   I believe that by having single-subject bills without them being  multisubject, complicated, and thousands of pages that we will be  better.   I believe that by requiring amendments to be germane--that is,  actually related to the underlying purpose of the underlying bill--that  we will be better.   Those are all things that will make us better.   But they will only make us better if we are all united in the purpose  of what we are trying to do.   I know I have got very strong disagreements with my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle. I have significant disagreements with a lot of  my friends on my side of the aisle. But, Mr. Speaker, you will never  solve those disagreements if you never sit down at the table and work.   The only way to work is to put some sort of constraint on our  spending. So with all due respect to my friend from Arizona (Mr.  Schweikert) with whom I agree about mandatory spending and about having  to solve those problems in the long term, discretionary spending  matters. Discretionary spending matters because it charts the  priorities of a Congress that represents the American people. We have  to make the tough choices on discretionary spending.   Oh, by the way, that they are only 20 or 25 percent of the overall  spending does not mean that they are not insignificant. If we do not  balance our budget right now and chart a course to balance that budget  over the next 10 years, we will spend an additional $10 trillion over  the next 10 years--that we don't have.   But what will happen is--and here is what is going to happen, this is  important for the American people to understand--we reached an  agreement as a party last week to ensure that we return to 2022 levels  of spending--that is a top line level of $1.471 trillion--and that we  operate with that cap in spending that says nothing about what the  levels are for defense or nondefense discretionary, just that we would  cap at 2022 levels of spending.    But here is what will happen. We will have a debate about that, and  we will pass some appropriations bills. If we do our job as  Republicans, we will pass good, solid bills for this year's spending  that stick within those caps and stay under the 2022 levels of  spending.   We will send them to the Senate, and Chuck Schumer will say--with all  sorts of wailing and gnashing of teeth--that we are taking food out of  the mouths of orphans and babies and that we are undermining the  ability of people to survive and live and that we are taking away their  medicine; we are killing people; and we are doing all sorts of horrible  things.   As a result, it will be September, and we won't have an agreement,  and then there will be some brinkmanship, a bunch of politics, and a  bunch of messaging and speeches, and then there will be a continuing  resolution that funds government at the current levels that were passed  in December under that $1.7 billion omnibus spending bill that was  passed on December 23 using Christmas as a backstop.   That is almost certainly what is going to happen if we don't stop it.   There are two ways to stop it: Democrats and Republicans sit down and  work honestly around a table to stop it, or brinkmanship, forcing the  question by bringing it to the brink. Those are the two possible ways  that we can try to stop what I just described will occur from  occurring. This is the reality of what we have got to change in this  body.   What else is going to happen?   Come summer, at some time undetermined--usually chosen by the  executive branch as the maximum moment to be able to extract some sort  of pain on the body--we will be told that the debt limit is going to be  reached. That might be May or June or July or August.   Then we will be told: You must raise the debt ceiling.   If any of us say: Wait a minute, why are we going to raise the debt  ceiling if we don't stop doing the things that are causing us to  accumulate more debt?  [[Page H200]]    If any of us dare to say that, what will happen?   Oh, my. It is already happening. The Wall Street Journal, all of the  bond traders and the stock traders on Wall Street, all of the  investment bankers, all of the brilliant economists, and all of the  opposing political party will all say:         Don't default on the debt. You can't default on the debt,       so don't you dare demand that we actually change the things       we are doing that are causing the debt because we might       default on the debt.        So let's keep spending money we don't have and keep       accumulating more debt increasing our interest payments and       making it more difficult to service that debt while we       undermine our own fiscal accountability and our own bonds       ratings in the future.        But no, no, don't you dare, Congressman Roy, say that you       might use the debt ceiling as leverage to extract fiscal       reforms to stop the insanity.    Let me just be clear. I think it is critical that we change the way  we are doing business, and I intend to use the debt ceiling to ensure  that we get fiscal and structural reforms. I am not going to bow down  just because a few of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and  a few pundits on TV write nasty editorials and some of my donors, some  of the people out there in the world and activists text you and say:  Oh, my Gosh, what are you doing? You are going to risk default on the  debt.   Do you know why I am not going to do that?   Because it is my job not to back down when people are afraid of what  we are supposed to do here. What we are supposed to do is bring things  to a decision in this body responsibly.   All last week while we were debating the Speaker, a whole bunch of my  friends and supporters--financial supporters--were blowing up my phone  with text messages. A whole lot of them were saying:         Attaboy, stand up, fight for the American people, change       the institution, and let us actually try to make that place       work rather than continuing down this road of destruction.    But a whole bunch of them were also texting me saying:         What are you doing? What are you doing?        We are not going to have a Republican Speaker. We are going       to get a Democrat Speaker. You guys look like clowns.        What are you doing?        You look ridiculous. You are making the Republican Party       look ridiculous, Chip. Stop doing it.    Come Friday after 15 votes, we came to a conclusion. Nobody died, and  nothing went crazy. We got a Speaker of the House, and we got some  agreements among all of us about how the body should proceed, about  ensuring we open it up, have transparency, offer more amendments, and  give greater ideological diversity among the committees.   Let's have a real debate on these things, and let's get a really  strong committee on the Judiciary Committee--a Church-style committee-- to look at how government is acting.   That is what we got by standing up and fighting and ignoring all of  the handwringers who can't stand the heat. Or to state it differently,  all of the handwringers out there in the chamber of commerce crowd and  the donor class who basically want us to do their bidding so they can  get richer.   That is the truth.   Don't default on the debt. That might hurt my financial bottom line,  Chip. Don't you dare rattle and have debates on the House floor that  might rock the boat, because my boat is pretty good, Chip. I am doing  quite well.   Mr. Speaker, there are a whole hell of a lot of people in this  country who are not doing well, and I am not here to represent the  donor class. I am not here to represent the talking heads. I am here to  represent every hardworking American across this country and  particularly in my district who are sick of the direction of this  country.    So I am glad that we had the debate that we had last week. I am glad  that we captivated the American people's attention. I am glad that C- SPAN was free to show the conversation and the debate. I am glad that  we did something we hadn't done in 100 years because it is the two- party system entrenched that has broken down the ability of Members of  this body to actually be Members.   That is actually our job.   Putting politics and partisan politics aside, it is our job as  individual Members of this body to come here and do our job. It is not  our job, for example, to get on a committee and say and do whatever the  chairman of the committee says which, by the way, is one of the things  that happens in this town.   Our job is to get on the committee and work, debate, put good bills  on the floor, amend those bills, debate those bills, and pass some of  those bills.                                time  1800    It is also not a race to introduce bills. It is not a race to pass  bills. What would be wrong if we only passed about 30 bills this whole  Congress? Would that be a bad thing? What if we only passed the 12  Appropriations bills, did our job, sent them to the Senate, passed a  handful of bills that would actually make our country better, and then  just sat back and worked a little bit and talked a little bit rather  than running down to the desk to file another bill to introduce another  statement to do another press conference to then run around and say:  Oh, we have to pass a messaging bill. Oh, this is such-and-such week.  This is the week for police officers, or this is the week for breast  cancer awareness, or this is the week for whatever somebody in the  Hallmark industry decided the week was for. Oh, well, we have to pass a  bill.   Why? Do you think we lack laws? Do you think we lack regulations? Do  you think we need to spend more money that we don't have? Why don't we  just stop, pause?   My message to my Republican colleagues is the best thing we could do  for our country is to stop doing all the things that this body has been  doing for as long as I can remember. Whatever this body has been doing,  let's do the opposite. How about that?   How about we actually have this Chamber full, like it was last week?  Why don't we have hundreds of people on the floor and debate issues in  front of each other? Why don't we pick a day like Tuesday and have 50  Members from one side and 50 Members from the other side and call that  debate day?   Let's debate Ukraine in full view of the American people. Maybe the  next week we can debate spending restraint, how we are going to tackle  spending. I would like to listen to my colleagues tell me how you plan  on tackling spending because, right now, my basic understanding of how  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would tackle spending is  tax people or keep spending money or both.   My view on this side of the aisle is that we don't want to tax  people, but we want to keep spending money in the name of defense.  Anybody want to come challenge me on that assertion? I am happy to  debate them. Either side of the aisle, come on down. Let's debate it. I  don't think anybody will take that debate on because they know I am  right.   Why don't we change that? Where are my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle when it comes to spending? I would like to know. I think  the American people deserve to know.   Do you believe in modern monetary theory, just keep spending money  and it doesn't matter? I don't. I think that is foolish. I think it is  reckless. I think it undermines our dollar. I think it undermines our  financial stability.   More importantly, I think it makes it impossible for us to make good  decisions about how to make policy and execute policy. How can you make  a tough decision about whether or not you need to buy a bomber or  whether or not you need to fund a particular grant program or fund a  particular entitlement that is way oversubscribed and out of money? How  can you make a decision about that if the answer is just to keep  printing money?   I mean, that is my question. I suggest there is no more important  question for us to answer because if we don't, then we are never going  to come to agreement on the policies, ever.   If I go home and talk to my wife and say, ``Look, we are going to cap  our spending at our 2022 levels of spending,'' then we have to make  choices. We have to decide, well, are we going to just not make our  mortgage payment? No, we have to do that. Are we going to not feed our  kids? Well, no, we have to feed our kids. Are we going to have  electricity and heat? Well, we would like to have that.   Then comes the discretionary questions: Do you take a vacation? Do  you get a new car rather than patching together your 15-year-old car?  Do you  [[Page H201]]  send your kids to a certain school? Do you save a certain amount of  money for college? Maybe you forgo college because you look at college  and say, ``Why am I going to spend $300,000 to send them to college  where they will teach my kids that America is evil?'' I will save that  for another rant.   That is my point. We have to do that as families, but this body never  does it, ever. We pretend to do it.   The point of the agreement reached last week was to open this body  up, empower rank-and-file, but also, importantly, establish some  parameters for how we fund the Federal Government. Those parameters  should be that we set limits. If you set limits, now you have to sit  down and figure it out.   Here is the problem. I don't believe that Chuck Schumer and Senate  Democrats want to sit down at the table and figure out how to limit  spending. I don't believe that the President of the United States or  his current Director of Office of Management and Budget or any of his  team wants to sit down at the table with us and figure out how to limit  spending.   I have not even heard them come down and say, ``Well, fine. You are  right, Chip. We are spending more money than we have, and we are  racking up more debt, so we believe we need to increase taxes.'' Okay.  Come make your offer. We will raise taxes. Show me how raising those  taxes is going to eliminate the deficit. He whispers, ``It is not.''   Show me how raising those taxes is not going to undermine economic  growth, make it more difficult for American people to get jobs,  undermine the prosperity of the American people. Show me that. Come  demonstrate that. He whispers, ``That is not really that easy to do.''   But our job is to responsibly represent the American people. It is  not to govern. We often use that word. That is crazy. We don't govern.  We represent. Our job is to represent our constituents. I don't know  any constituents--frankly, even my most left-leaning constituents, to  be honest--saying, ``Oh, yes, please go up there and spend more money  we don't have.''   I would just suggest that, according to the CBO, we are going to see  another $15.7 trillion in deficits over the next 10 years. That is the  truth. The truth is that, in fiscal year 2022, we collected a record  $4.9 trillion in taxes, nearly a trillion more than the previous year.    We don't have a revenue problem. We have a spending problem. We have  an overpromise problem.   I had a reporter come up to me in the hallway a minute ago and say:  Mr. Roy, are there any circumstances in which you are going to support  providing more aid to Ukraine?   How on Earth are we having that conversation on January 11 after, on  December 23, we just added another $45 billion for Ukraine?   The reporter responded and said: They say that it is really important  to get more money to beat Russia.   Oh, really? What do our experts say? What is our responsibility to  pay for that? Do we just write a check anytime a world leader comes and  says, ``But it is really important for my people that you write me a  check''?   I want someone to write me a check, minus all the ethics stuff. Don't  go write all that.   Look, the truth is, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert) is  100 percent correct that mandatory spending--Social Security, Medicare,  all the related expenditures that go along with that--are driving the  vast majority of the debt that we are accumulating every year. That is  correct. If you are not willing to take on discretionary spending, how  are you going to take on Social Security, Medicare, and reforming those  to work when the first ad that is going to be run is going to be  pushing granny off the cliff, if you dare even have a conversation  about the issue?   I will make an invitation to any colleague in the Chamber, but  particularly my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, come down  here and talk about Social Security and Medicare and all of our  mandatory spending.   I will issue the same request that my colleagues on this side of the  aisle acknowledge, that you cannot hide behind Social Security,  Medicare, and mandatory spending to say that we shouldn't limit  discretionary spending, defense spending because that is an  insignificant part of the budget.   It is significant, and it is significant not just because of the  trillions of dollars of debt that those spending accounts for Defense,  Education, Department of Justice, Commerce, and every other agency,  Homeland Security--it is not just because we are spending too much  money there, and it is adding up to deficits and debts. It is because  we are funding the very agencies that are undermining us.   We are funding the bureaucrats who are undermining the current  individual in America who is out there as an entrepreneur trying to get  a job started. It is undermining my friend Scott Smith in Loudoun  County because we label him a domestic terrorist because the FBI was  brought in along with the National School Board Association. They all  coordinated and said: Okay, let's label him a domestic terrorist.   We are funding a Department of Homeland Security that wants to  continue to create or execute policies that invite more people to come  to our border, endangering them and us.   The reason you care about discretionary spending is because it funds  the policies of government, of the bureaucracy, of the administrative  state that undermines our well-being, undermines our prosperity.   We have the opportunity now, right now, as Republicans to lead the  House of Representatives forward to change. We should, in fact, change.   Last week was a monumental step forward to changing this institution,  to opening it up, to allowing rank-and-file Members to have a say, to  putting more diversity on our committees, to having more debate in  committees, coming down to the floor, and fighting for the people that  we represent. All of that will be for naught if we don't embrace  wholeheartedly the mission, the hard mission, of limiting the spending  that is destroying our country and demanding that our colleagues on the  other side of the aisle come sit down at the table so that we can  actually do our jobs for the people we represent.   Then, finally, send a message to the United States Senate, to the  Democrat-led United States Senate, to the Democrat President of the  United States at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue that it is not  enough to give speeches. It is not enough to oppose what we produce out  of the people's House.   The American people spoke in November. They want us to be  responsible. They want us to limit spending. They want us to secure the  United States. They want us to have a secure and sovereign border. They  want us to get out of their business. They want us to stop being at  each other's throats. If you want to do that, then embrace fiscal  responsibility and stop spending money you don't have to fund the  bureaucrats who are undermining our liberties.   Stand up in defense of liberties, civil liberties and the freedoms of  the American people, by calling out the bureaucrats in our committees  and exposing it through oversight.   Stand up for a strong military that is nonwoke, that is sparingly  used but ready to go fight when needed.   Secure the border of the United States with the policies that are  necessary to do so and embrace radical federalism where we return power  to the States so we can agree to disagree and stop being at each  other's throats.   Do you want to do those things? Then there is one key thing you have  to do. You have to fight the swamp. You have to take on the  bureaucracy. You have to take on the powers that be.   That started last week. We have some of the tools that we need, but  that battle is just beginning. We are going to take this town on for  the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 14 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, January 12, 2023, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
