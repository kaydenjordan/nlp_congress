 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, tonight, I am convening a Special Order  hour for the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and we are focused on  the urgent matter of our children's mental health, which is in crisis.   Madam Speaker, I want everyone listening to me now to think about  their childhood.   What stressors, if any, did you experience?   What kept you up at night?   What made your heart skip a beat or your palms sweaty?   What seemed completely overwhelming?   Now think of who was there to help you, listen to you, and comfort  you.  [[Page H8049]]  Now imagine that stressor, and imagine dealing with that same issue in  a time when the worldwide pandemic forced you to remain at home for  more than 1 year before you returned to school with constantly  fluctuating COVID policies; in a world where the book you read last  year is banned in school now; in a world where you spend a significant  amount of time on social media consuming stories and pictures of other  peoples' lives, and that includes coming across lies and  disinformation; in a world where a former President wanted to build a  wall, where death is ubiquitous, and where food, gas, and housing  prices are so high you often go without the basic necessities; in a  world where the Supreme Court has stripped basic human rights that your  parents and grandparents were able to enjoy.   Could you imagine being a child right now and juggling your mental  health?   Mental health is essential for overall health, and ignoring that  basic fact is harmful to our children who are counting on us to do  everything in our power to support them during this difficult time.   This pandemic has exacerbated many preexisting challenges, stressors,  and trauma experienced by our youth.   It has also caused many new challenges.   In December 2021, the U.S. Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek Murthy, issued  an advisory highlighting the urgent need to address the Nation's youth  mental health crisis.   Last fall, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy  of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and the Children's Hospital  Association jointly declared a national state of emergency in  children's mental health.   Prior to coming to Congress, I had the privilege of serving New York  City children in our public schools for over 20 years. I served as an  elementary school teacher, a high school guidance counselor, and a  middle school principal.   The education, care, and well-being of our children are my life's  work, and it is an honor to speak on the floor tonight to highlight an  urgent issue that is critical to the health and safety of our children  and the future of our democracy: our children's mental health.   During the 2017-2018 school year, 34 children died within the K-12  school system in the Bronx, and 17 died via suicide. In early 2018, the  horrible Parkland High School shooting happened, killing 17 children  and wounding 17 more while leaving a nation reeling in despair.    During this time as a middle school principal, I saw a rise in  student self-harm and suicidal ideation in kids as young as 11 years  old. It was these factors that ultimately led me to run for Congress in  the first place.   Since the pandemic, an unprecedented number of our young people feel  helpless and hopeless right now, and we need to make an unprecedented  effort for a coordinated, comprehensive response. That is why at the  end of last year we called for a new COVID relief package that  considers the needs of the whole child to support overall health,  including youth mental health.   The toll of the pandemic is daunting when we consider its impact on  children. In the past 2 years, more than 167,000 children across the  country have lost a parent or primary caregiver to COVID-19. These  caregivers provided a child's most important basic needs: love,  security, food, and shelter. More than 13,000 of these children lost  their only caregiver. In fact, for every four COVID-19 deaths, one  child in the U.S. loses a parent.   A student in my district in Yonkers shared her experience of suddenly  losing her father to COVID followed by her mother testing positive. She  described her fear and not being able to sleep while her mother was in  an induced coma for 9 days. She couldn't eat, and she couldn't go to  school. Because of her father's immigration status, he was excluded  from almost all types of medical insurance and was forced to choose  between basic healthcare and food.   Her story is not the only one like this, which is why we need to  drive resources so that schools can directly support students' mental  health and so we can break down barriers to basic, necessary healthcare  for all regardless of immigration status.   After experiencing the major traumatic loss of a parent, we know the  world as these children knew it has ended. Loss and grief are a part of  life, but in children grieving, a major loss can have lifelong impacts  of depression, post-traumatic stress, and anxiety.                                time  1715    For parents and those of us who work directly with children, it is  heartbreaking to see one child grieving. With this vast number of  grieving children, our entire community must be ready to empathize and  mobilize the help they need to cope.   In addition to the stress youth are under as a result of COVID-19 and  this ongoing pandemic, they are also facing other mental health issues  as they navigate puberty and being an adolescent. Youth across the  country are battling substance abuse, eating and body image disorders,  facing various forms of peer pressure, anxiety, and overall trying to  learn how to manage their emotions and feelings during their formative  years. This is a reality across racial and economic lines.   Still, meaningful mental health care is out of reach for so many  children. Native American or Indigenous children are 4\1/2\ times as  likely as White children to have lost a parent to COVID. Black children  are almost 2\1/2\ times more likely than White children, and Hispanic  children are nearly twice as likely than White children to have lost a  parent or caregiver.   When we also consider that many families who face job losses, loss of  insurance, financial hardships, and a lack of school-based mental  health professionals, the barriers to youth mental health support are  unacceptable.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).    Madam Speaker, I thank Mrs. Watson Coleman for her  leadership and her voice in this important matter.   Madam Speaker, I want to talk briefly before yielding to  Representative Carter from New Orleans. I want to speak briefly about  the role of schools in addressing the issue of mental health.   Our schools play an essential role in supporting positive mental  health for our youth. In order to serve the whole child, we cannot  limit our Federal support to only academic outcomes. Children are much  more likely to receive mental health services in the school than  anywhere else, but the problem is that too few of our schools have  enough mental health professionals on staff, including psychologists,  social workers, and counselors. The ratio of students to school  psychologists is roughly 1400 to 1.   Just this year I hosted a town hall with students in my district who  shared how hard it was for them to meet with a counselor or mental  health professional at school. The students with more access to mental  health resources went to schools in wealthier parts of my district.   As a former principal, I know firsthand how important it is that the  schools have the resources to employ mental health professionals. More  than 14 million students attend a school with police officers or school  resource officers, but no counselors, nurses, psychologists, or social  workers on staff.   The way we allocate resources is a reflection of our priorities and  our values, which is why I support unprecedented levels of funding that  prioritizes the mental health of all our students by making sure there  are trained, culturally competent mental health professionals in every  public school, including more Black and Brown mental health  professionals.   For the last 2\1/2\ years, we have seen our schools at the front  lines of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. In many ways, we as a  society have shifted how we think about what it means to care for our  young people in the face of multiple public health crises.   Together, with our schools leading the way, we worked to create a  safety net for our children and prioritize the well-being of the whole  child. These are the kinds of investments that can buffer children from  chronic stress that can lead to adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs.   It should go without saying, our kids are so much more than any one  test score or academic measure. Children are individuals who are  members of their community, and our schools should be subsequently  funded and equipped as community hubs. Supporting our children's  success is fundamentally intertwined with supporting the whole child in  a well-coordinated ecosystem of wraparound services.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Louisiana  (Mr. Carter).    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Carter so much for  his powerful words and leadership and for being here this evening.   When we consider the toll of a nationwide youth mental health crisis,  our mission must be to show love to our youth and to help our young  people learn to love themselves, their communities, and our planet.   In the face of so many real-world challenges, like the climate  crisis, the pandemic, and extreme inequality and discrimination, it is  essential that children's learning prioritizes creativity, innovation,  critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and collaboration as  these approaches all support the mental health and the overall  development of our children. These are the 21st century learning skills  that will empower and teach our students how to think, not what to  think.   When the purpose of education is about fostering the value and ethic  of lifelong learning as a fundamental pillar of democracy, it is  abundantly clear that promoting positive mental health is fundamental  to that work.   But when we try to apply a business model to our schools and treat  our students as commodities, making the necessary investments in mental  health support and social and emotional learning gets sidelined in  favor of a more simplistic bottom line that improperly fixates on the  results of an annual assessment.   We have subjected our public schools to this model for 20 years, and  it hasn't addressed inequity in our schools. It has not closed any  gaps. What it has done is limit what gets taught and how it gets  taught.   It has prioritized doing well academically over developing the  lifelong skills that you need, including your emotional health and  well-being. It has made students feel that their chance to live a  quality life with opportunities hinges on how they do on a singular  exam.   We have the opportunity to change this, finally, and do right by our  students. The idea that our schools should be equipped to meet the  holistic needs of their students is not one that should exist only in a  time of a pandemic. We cannot go back to our old ways of thinking about  schools just in terms of narrowly defined academic performance.   Even before the pandemic, rates of young people experiencing mental  health issues were rising. Between 2007 and 2019, the percentage of  adolescents reporting a major depressive episode increased by nearly 60  percent. By 2019, mental health disorders had exceeded physical  conditions as the most common cause of impairments and limitations  amongst children.   I saw the gaps in our health system up close. Schools are the most  common place for children to access mental health services, but most  schools do not meet recommended ratios for school psychologists, social  workers, or counselors. Instead, even before the pandemic, we saw  pediatricians, teachers, school leaders, and more stepping in to try to  provide mental health services, despite many of them not feeling fully  equipped to do so. The pandemic only exacerbated all of these issues  and put further strain on a health system that was already not built to  adequately support youth mental health.   As COVID surged, emergency room visits for young people having a  mental health crisis increased dramatically. Since 2019, ER visits for  suspected suicide attempts rose 51 percent amongst girls ages 12 to 17.  But high COVID hospitalization rates and, later, the surge of new  variants, combined with inadequate vaccination rates, mean that we had  and continue to have a shortage of hospital beds and emergency rooms to  service young people having a mental health crisis.   In an op-ed by a constituent of mine, Jonathan Slater, a child and  adolescent psychiatrist, described children and teenagers at his  hospital having to wait 3 to 4 days for an inpatient bed.   The strain on hospital capacity caused by the ongoing pandemic means  our ability to adequately treat all other physical and mental health is  jeopardized. The more people get vaccinated and boosted, that means  fewer people in the hospital, and it means the 15-year-old who lost her  parent to COVID and hasn't experienced a normal school year since she  was 12 can get access to the emergency mental health care that she  needs.   I want to express immense gratitude for the many people, teachers,  school leaders, pediatricians, school bus drivers, emergency room  physicians, and staff who have stepped in to confront the youth mental  health crisis head-on. But we cannot address youth mental health  without addressing issues we face in our broader healthcare system and  without addressing workforce issues in mental health professions.   As we continue to face compounding public health and mental health  crises among our young people, we have to recognize that cultivating a  better Nation, marked by healthy and happy young people who are  equipped to engage critically and collaboratively with their  communities and our democracy, requires us to continue on the path of  rethinking schools and their purpose and potential.   We need Federal investments and resources in our schools that reflect  these priorities, and that means putting the mental health and well- being of our students front and center as we move forward.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib), and I thank her very much for  being here.    Madam Speaker, I thank Rashida for her voice. It is good  to see her and be with her.   Tonight, we have heard from Members who represent communities across  the country. The youth mental health crisis is a national crisis that  requires an all-of-government response. Our children deserve nothing  less.   There were so many voices that contributed to these remarks this  evening from my district, New York-16. I recognize them at this moment.   Making the necessary investments in our youth mental health will take  all of us at every level of government and in every community.   I give a special shout-out to constituents of mine who shared their  priorities around youth mental health. Jonathan Lewis, a Scarsdale  Village trustee, shared how important it is to understand the  relationship between a mental health crisis and learned outcomes to our  students, not just in an academic sense but also with respect to school  climate and the importance of creating a learning environment that is  safe from violence.    Stephanie Marquesano from the harris project in Ardsley highlighted  how important it is that communities, youth, and all levels of  government be in dialogue with each other about the intersection of  mental health and substance use disorders, particularly as it relates  to our youth.   Ron Hartridge, educator and advocate in the Bronx, expressed his deep  concern regarding the impact that trauma and fear have on our children  and how important it is to equip our schools to support students  instead of prioritizing compliant behavior, which is so often used to  justify and perpetuate the school-to-prison pipeline.   Jonathan Alvarez from 914United in Yonkers called for meaningful  juvenile justice reform in the Lower Hudson Valley.   Darryl Taylor, a Tuckahoe Village trustee, wrote in about the toll of  the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly on our youth who lost loved ones,  parents, siblings, or friends, and the urgency we must have to reach  out to our youth who may be feeling alone in their grief and  hopelessness.   Mary Graves, Mount Vernon's Democratic chair, shared how important it  is that we make mental health resources and support available to the  whole community and consider how there isn't a one-size-fits-all  approach to mental health.   Julie Cordin from my district shared how troubling it is to learn  that suicidal ideation and attempted suicides amongst children  increased during the pandemic and that this will not go away on its  own. We have to work on this together. I am so grateful to all of my  constituents who care so deeply about our youth, both locally and  nationally.    The youth mental health crisis is a national crisis that requires an  all-of-government response. Our children deserve nothing less.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
