 Madam Speaker, from volume I, page 14, section 2, entitled:  ``Russian `Active Measures' Social Media Campaign,'' it read as  follows:   ``The IRA''--which was a Russian troll farm. ``The IRA and its  employees began operations targeting the United States as early as  2014. Using fictitious U.S. personas, IRA employees operated social  media accounts and group pages designed to attract U.S. audiences.  These groups and accounts, which addressed divisive U.S. political and  social issues, falsely claimed to be controlled by U.S. activists. Over  time, the social media accounts became a means to reach large U.S.  audiences. IRA employees traveled to the United States in mid-2014 on  an intelligence-gathering mission to obtain information and photographs  for use in their social media posts.''
