 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, our Nation is continuing to confront  the public health challenge posed by the new coronavirus. Right now, as  Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health reminds us, the  risk that any individual American will contract the disease remains  low. This is not a time for fear. It is a time to continue calmly  scaling up serious and smart preparations that have already been  underway so the United States can continue working to blunt, slow, and  mitigate the spread within our borders.   The most recent global health security index rated the United States  the No. 1 overall most prepared country in the world for an infectious  disease outbreak--the No. 1 overall most prepared country in the world  for an infectious disease outbreak. Our resources, capabilities, and  expertise are the envy of the rest of the world.   In this instance, the President's early, bold actions to impose  travel restrictions and quarantine measures back in January bought our  Nation more time and more room to continue preparing.   With that said, there was never any illusion that our country of more  than 300 million people and nearly 4 million square miles could be  entirely sealed off from the rest of the world. The question was never  if we would have to combat the coronavirus here on U.S. soil, but when  and to what degree.   As Dr. Fauci noted yesterday, we are now seeing instances of  community spread here in the United States, and the CDC has now  confirmed nearly 500 cases on U.S. soil. With respect to individual  best practices and precautions, all Americans should follow the  recommendations of the CDC and their State and local authorities.  Detailed suggestions for different personal situations are available  online at www.cdc.gov.  Officials in my home State of Kentucky are currently monitoring four  confirmed cases. I spoke to the Governor this morning and will continue  to stay in close touch to make sure that Kentucky and all 50 States  have what they need and know Congress has their back.   Last week, the Senate passed nearly $8 billion in supplemental  funding, which President Trump signed into law. It will deliver surge  resources to national public health experts, frontline healthcare  professionals, and State and local governments as they work together to  protect Americans. That legislation ensured a funding floor of at least  $7 million will go to Kentucky to help fight the virus.   In addition, I want to recognize and thank our colleague, the junior  Senator from Texas. Ten days ago, he briefly interacted with an  individual who has since tested positive for the virus. Even though he  feels fine and it has already been 10 days, after consulting with  experts, Senator Cruz elected to work from home this week out of an  abundance of caution. We will certainly miss our colleague around the  Capitol this week, but I want to commend him for taking the initiative.  We had a chance to talk yesterday.   So here is the bottom line: Our great Nation is very strong. We have  enormous expertise and tremendous capabilities, and Congress, on a  bipartisan basis, has made sure our health experts and leaders have the  funding they need.   With calm and competence, all Americans--all of them--should continue  to listen to the experts, take their advice, and take commonsense steps  to protect ourselves, our families, and our communities.                                   S. 2657    Mr. President, now, on another matter here on the Senate floor, we  will pick up where we left off last week: considering a comprehensive  set of updates to the way our Nation approaches energy efficiency,  security, and innovation.   As Chairman Murkowski pointed out last week, it has been about 12  years since the last such package, and since then, America's energy  sector has undergone some real changes. New technology has opened new  doors for energy production and also presented new threats to our  electrical grid and other critical infrastructure.   Even at a time when a strong job market has continued to bring  Americans off the sidelines, the domestic energy sector has outpaced  the economy as a whole in job creation. Increased access to our  abundant domestic reserves has unleashed American energy on the  international market. In fact, the Department of Energy has predicted  the United States will become a net exporter of energy this year for  the first time since 1953.   Over the past 12 years, we have seen plenty of attempts to intervene  in this  [[Page S1619]]  evolution of the American energy sector. Under the last administration,  we saw an anti-domestic energy mindset that manifested in proposals  like the so-called Clean Power Plan. That would have buried domestic  energy in a tangle of stifling redtape and would have jeopardized more  than 100,000 American jobs. The working families I represent in  Kentucky faced that threat head-on.   Even more recently, we saw Democratic Party standard bearers roll out  a far-left proposal that would ban affordable forms of domestic power  and let Washington micromanage everything from American jobs to their  cars to their homes. We saw only a small number of our Senate  Democratic colleagues able to vote against this radical proposal. That  is the wrong way to think about American energy dominance.   Fortunately, thanks to the dedicated work of our colleagues on the  Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the bipartisan bill before us  is the right way to go about it. The legislation before us includes  provisions and input from nearly three-fourths of this body. From grid  security and workforce training to energy storage and carbon capture,  the Senate has a chance to pass a number of important updates to energy  policy on a wide bipartisan basis.   I hope and anticipate the Senate will be able to process amendments  and then pass the American Energy Innovation Act this week.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the  bill.    Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the  vote.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, it is my honor today to pay tribute to  a brave Kentucky veteran who passed away last month at the age of 96.  John Robert Miller, of Glasgow, KY, led a remarkable life of generous  service and lasting achievement. As a member of the ``greatest  generation,'' John Robert defended our Nation and its ideals before  coming home to raise a family and lead his community.   Like many brave Kentuckians, John Robert volunteered to serve our  country during the Second World War. Over the coming years in the Army  Artillery, he achieved the rank of technical sergeant and was stationed  for 3 years in the South Pacific. For the rest of his life, his pride  in our Nation and his military service were well known to all.   John Robert returned to Barren County after the war and married  Christine McGuire, his inseparable partner for the next 67 years.  Together they built a proud life. He turned to agriculture, owning a  dairy farm while also growing several crops and raising angus cattle.  His love for the land inspired John Robert to share his knowledge with  the next generation of Kentucky farmers through 4-H. An active mentor  and guide, he was elected State chairman of the Kentucky 4-H Leadership  Council.   John Robert seemed to be constantly thinking of how he could help  others. In addition to his farm and a small business he owned, he was  elected to the Barren County Fiscal Court. With the strong support of  those he served, John Robert was twice reelected. As a local election  commissioner for more than two decades, he also earned admiration and  the lasting gratitude of his community. He received multiple awards in  recognition of his life of service for others, including the Barren  County Patriot Award.   I would like to share my heartfelt condolences with John Robert's  children, Johnny, Lanny, and Donnie. Their father, John Robert,  contributed to our Commonwealth's bright future. Through his hard work,  his faith, and his refusal to quit, he left behind a legacy to be proud  of. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in honoring a treasured  Kentuckian, John Robert Miller.                            ____________________
