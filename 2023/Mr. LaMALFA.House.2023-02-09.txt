 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of the memory of Yuba  County Sheriff Gary Dennis Tindel.   Gary was born in October of 1947. He graduated from Marysville High  School in 1965 and then went on to attend UC Davis and Cal State, Chico  shortly afterward.   He joined the Yuba County Sheriff's Department in 1971. In 1975, he  married his wife, Irene Chesini, and together they raised three  children: Josh, Michelle, and Alicia. In 1990, he was elected Sheriff  in Yuba County and served two terms in that role.   In his spare time, he taught law enforcement classes at Butte College  and served as assistant coroner down in Marin County.   Even after retiring from public service, he continued to serve his  people, his community, as an active member of the Kiwanis Club, helping  with local Little Leagues and Boy Scouts.   He was a devoted family man and a paragon in his community. From his  outstanding public service to his volunteering to keep our streets  safe, his influence was felt everywhere.   It is with deep condolences to Gary's family and everyone who knew  him that I rise today. This ideal American man will be dearly missed.  May he rest in eternal peace.                            ____________________
