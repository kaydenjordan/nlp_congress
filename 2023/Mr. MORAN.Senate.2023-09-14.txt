 Mr. President, the Chase County Courthouse is a  striking monument situated in Cottonwood Falls and visible across much  of the surrounding prairie. Built in 1873, the courthouse's limestone  exterior, walnut staircase, and distinctive red roof have made it a  landmark on the plains. Designed in French Renaissance style by John G.  Haskell of Leavenworth, the courthouse is the oldest Kansas courthouse  still in use.   This year marks the courthouse's 150th anniversary of service to the  community. In 1856, several families moved to the south side of  Cottonwood River, and soon after, the Chase County boundaries were  drawn. The pioneers who established Cottonwood Falls decided to build a  local courthouse and workers began construction on the courthouse. The  community chose a courthouse that would stand 113-feet tall, containing  a three-story spiral staircase made from trees near the Cottonwood  River. The limestone used to construct the courthouse came from Chase  County and is known as Cottonwood limestone. This same limestone was  used in the Kansas State Capitol, Kansas State University, and can be  found in the U.S. Capitol forming the base for the statue of Amelia  Earhart. In 1917, the courthouse was entered in the National Registry  of Historic Places and the Kansas Historical Site Register and serves  as a tribute to the pioneers who made the Flint Hill their home and the  builders who constructed the courthouse.   I have visited downtown Cottonwood Falls many times and have seen the  community grow over the years. Rural county courthouses play an  important role in preserving these communities. The courthouse is a  place where justice is administered, wedding vows are made, election  votes are tallied, wills are signed, and disputes are resolved.   On the 150th anniversary of the Chase County Courthouse, I am honored  to recognize and commemorate this courthouse which is the pride of  Cottonwood Falls and a monument on the plains.                            ____________________
