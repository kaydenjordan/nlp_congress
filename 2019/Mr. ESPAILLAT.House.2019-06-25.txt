 Mr. Chair, on June 25, 2019, I was absent for recorded  vote No. 406. Had I been present, I would have voted yea.                             personal explanation     Madam Speaker, like many Americans, like many of my  colleagues, I am deeply troubled by the way the Trump administration  has handled the treatment of migrants, particularly children, at the  border.   But I stand here to say tonight, Madam Speaker, that if, by passing  this emergency supplemental bill, we will save one child's life, just  one child's life, then it is worth it, and we should vote for it.   We speak about the moneys as being allocated in the budget. But the  only number that is really important in this debate is the six children  that have died at the border. And we will continue to hold this  administration accountable for its treatment of migrants, particularly  young children.   Madam Speaker, every time we deny help to the triangle countries,  this crisis is aggravated. Every time we stop a mom and her children at  the border and they have to go through the river and drown, this crisis  is worsened. Every time we deny children the basic human services that  they need, this crisis becomes tragic.
