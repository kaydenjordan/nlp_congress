Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden), who is the chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee, and I would like to thank him for all the work he has done  on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first, let me just thank the gentlewoman from Illinois,  the ranking member on the subcommittee, for her hard work on the  legislation. I really appreciate it.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 3388, the SELF  DRIVE Act, which we advanced out of the Energy and Commerce Committee  on a unanimous, bipartisan vote of 54-0 in July. This compromise  legislation aims to improve consumer safety by reducing traffic-related  fatalities and injuries, clarify the Federal and State roles, and  stimulate job growth and economic opportunities.   Many of you have heard these roadway safety statistics, but they  again bear repeating. Each year, approximately 6 million Americans are  involved in car accidents resulting in nearly 2 million injuries.  Ninety-four percent of the accidents are attributed to human errors or  decisions. In 2016 approximately 40,000 people lost their lives on U.S.  highways. Sadly, in my home State of Ohio, traffic deaths have been on  the rise over the last few years.   We have an opportunity today to support and promote the safe testing  and deploying of this life-saving technology. U.S. companies are  investing major resources in the research and development of this  technology and should not be held up by regulatory barriers that were  created when self-driving cars were science fiction. We must act, and  we must act now.   The SELF DRIVE Act establishes a streamlined path for the testing,  development, and deployment of self-driving cars in the United States.  While this technology is currently being tested in certain parts of the  country, there are limits to who can test and what technology can be  used in cars today. Federal motor vehicle safety standards need to be  updated because self-driving cars may not have the traditional steering  wheels and brake pedals that all cars have today.   Additionally, this legislation maximizes opportunities for research  and development here in the United States to create jobs and grow  economic opportunities so that the United States can remain a global  leader in this industry. With this legislation, innovation can flourish  without the heavy hand of government.   Finally, this legislation will enhance the ability of our senior  citizens, the disability community, and individuals in underserved  communities enjoy more mobility and live more independently.   This legislation is the first of its kind, focused on the car of the  future that is more of a supercomputer on wheels. This issue started  with our good friend and colleague, Dr. Burgess, who held the first  disrupter series hearing on self-driving cars last Congress.   Again, we would also not be where we are today if it weren't for the  leadership of Chairperson Walden and the great working relationship and  cooperation of Ranking Member Pallone, Ranking Member Schakowsky, and  Ranking Member Dingell, as well as our many cosponsors. I appreciate  their comments, suggestions, and input.   We have held multiple hearings, technology showcases, and real-life  demonstrations for our committee's members to learn about the  opportunities and challenges presented by self-driving cars.   I also want to acknowledge the stakeholders who have been willing to  work with us. The automotive industry is a competitive and vibrant  marketplace and touches every congressional district in the country.                                time  1130    In the process of drafting and marking up this legislation, we had  over 300 meetings with automakers, tech companies, suppliers, trade  associations, the disability community, senior State transportation  leaders, and, last but not least, the National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration.   Safety should and always will be our number one priority. We have  said and will continue to say: Safety first, safety last, safety  always. I truly believe this bill will make a real difference for  everyday Americans.   In closing, I want to thank our great staff for their hard work late  nights and weekends to get us where we are to this historic vote.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Upton), chairman of the Energy Subcommittee on the Energy  and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Burgess), chairman of the Health Subcommittee on the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Harper), vice chairman of the Digital Commerce and  Consumer Protection Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Lance).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Bucshon).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Mimi Walters).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello).    Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the gentlewoman, the ranking  member on the subcommittee, for all of her hard work on this  legislation. Again, we wouldn't be here without the bipartisanship that  we had on this piece of legislation.   Also, again, I want to thank our staff. There were a lot of weekends  and nights that they put in to make sure that we got this bill to where  we are today.   But, again, as has been mentioned today, we have been talking about  what this legislation is going to do. We have been looking at safety,  cybersecurity, privacy, making sure that some folks in the community  right now who aren't able to get out, some of our senior population,  and those with disabilities, have the ability to be able to get around  to go to jobs and go to the grocery store.   The legislation has been a culmination of a lot of work over two  sessions. Again, I want to thank Dr. Burgess for his hard work that he  did in the last Congress as the chairman of the subcommittee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The amendment I am offering today highlights a critical security  concern that must be addressed in order to keep the American people  safe. Over the past several years, terrorists in Europe and around the  world have added vehicular attacks to their deadly arsenal. From Paris  to Barcelona and Jerusalem to London, terrorists have rented trucks and  vans to commit horrible attacks, leaving hundreds dead and countless  seriously injured.   While the United States has yet to experience an attack on the scale  of those that have occurred in Europe, we must do everything in our  power to make sure that the individuals who do us harm do not  eventually slip through the cracks.   I believe the U.S. Department of Homeland Security should have the  discretion to use its funds to explore partnerships with van and truck  rental companies so that background checks may be conducted for  individuals attempting to procure these vehicles. This amendment is a  first step towards recognizing and addressing the potential  vulnerability of American citizens to these terrible attacks.   It is my hope that I continue to work with the chairman as well as  the Committee on Homeland Security to pursue legislative measures that  will address the vehicular attacks and actions so that we can guard  against them.   I thank the chairman, the ranking member, and my colleagues for their  support.
