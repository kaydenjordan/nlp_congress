 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado  (Mr. Buck) for his help in quickly bringing this resolution to the  floor.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the  underlying resolution, which would block the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau from denying the American people the use of  arbitration as a means to resolve consumer complaints.   Since the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,  consumer costs have gone up and access to financial products has been  severely restricted. In some cases, access has evaporated altogether.   The Bureau's arbitration rule is proof of what we have said for  years: the CFPB does not operate in the best interest of American  consumers. It does not protect the American people, their access to  financial products, or their ability to achieve financial independence.   Take as evidence the CFPB's own study on arbitration. It shows that  just 13 percent of class action suits actually provided a benefit to  consumers, with an average payout of $32. Let me say that again: an  average payout of $32.   Arbitration, on the other hand, provides an average of more than  $5,000--let me say that again: over $5,000--to the aggrieved parties.   Again, these figures come from the Bureau's own analysis, their own  study. The fact that they cannot somehow justify this rule in the name  of consumer protection should offend every single person on this floor  today, Madam Speaker.   Simply put, this rule is anticonsumer. It hurts the very people the  CFPB purports to protect. It is yet another example of the Washington- knows-best attitude that makes the American people so mad.   This is also why Congress has the oversight tools granted under the  Congressional Review Act. In this instance, it is time for Congress to  intervene on behalf of the people we represent.   We have argued about the CFPB in the past, but the reality is that  this rule, in particular, will have devastating consequences for  American consumers. It should serve as a dramatic wake-up call for the  need to restrain what is the most powerful and  [[Page H6231]]  unaccountable government agency in the history of our Nation.   I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus) and Chairman  Hensarling for their steadfast leadership on this very important issue.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues for their support on the rule and  the underlying measure.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution which would  block the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from denying the  American people use of arbitration as a means to resolve consumer  complaints.   I went to the CFPB website last night, and the first thing I saw  read: ``We are the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a U.S.  Government agency that makes sure banks, lenders, and other financial  companies treat you fairly.''   If we handed out grades to government agencies based on their ability  to meet a mission statement, the CFPB would most decidedly receive an  F. That is because the Bureau's arbitration rule does absolutely  nothing to ensure that consumers are treated fairly. In fact, this rule  is proof of what House Republicans have said for years: the CFPB does  not operate in the best interests of the American consumers.   The Bureau's own study, which we have cited several times already and  will continue to cite, shows that arbitration helps consumers and that  the alternatives are far less successful.                                time  1545    Mr. Speaker, the truth of the matter is that this rule is  anticonsumer. It hurts the very people the CFPB is supposed to protect,  and it is yet another example of Washington bureaucrats looking out for  their friends instead of the American people.   Today, this body will cast a vote to ensure U.S. consumers are  treated fairly and that they have the tools necessary to get the best  possible settlement in their case.   Mr. Speaker, if the CFPB can't adhere to a simple mission statement  and provide actual consumer protections, Congress will do it for them.   I want to again thank Chairman Hensarling and the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus) for their leadership on this issue and so  many more issues that impact consumers.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), chairman of the Capital Markets, Securities,  and Investments Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), chairman of the Financial Services Monetary Policy  and Trade Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton), vice chairman of the Oversight  and Investigations Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams), the vice chairman of the Monetary  Policy and Trade Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney), a member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Trott), a member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining on each  side?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff).    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining on each  side?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, that is what arbitration is all about,  to allow the individual to defend himself.  [[Page H6277]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling), the chairman of the Financial  Services Committee, and I think we are going to have some answers to  those important questions that the ranking member just asked.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
