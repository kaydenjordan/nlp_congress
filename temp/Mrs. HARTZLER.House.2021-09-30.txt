 Madam Speaker, Democrats are here today proposing an  elaborate spending scheme that will cost $3.5 trillion.   President Biden claimed this week it would cost zero dollars.   Well, what is the truth? Let's find out what is in this Trojan horse  of a spending bill:   The largest tax increase in American history.   A business tax that is going to be higher than Communist China, which  is our number one adversary, putting us at a competitive disadvantage  and causing jobs to go overseas.   The highest inflation in four decades. Already, families are being  hit with high costs at the gas pump and at the grocery store. It is  only going to get worse with this bill.   $630 billion for the Green New Deal. This includes a $7.5 billion to  create a  [[Page H5566]]  Civilian Climate Corps, which would create over a million climate  activists at taxpayer expense.   $80 billion to double the number of IRS agents.                            ____________________
