 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor a hero in my  district who passed away this week.   Mr. Derrick Nelson was the principal of the high school in Westfield,  New Jersey. He was known to students, to parents, and to teachers for  his generosity and selflessness.   Mr. Nelson dedicated his life to serving his country and community.  He spent 20 years in the U.S. Army Reserves, including a deployment in  the Middle East.   He began his career in New Jersey education in 2002 and joined the  Westfield school system in 2010, officially becoming principal in 2017.  Students and teachers said he always had a smile on his face, and his  energy was infectious.   It was this kindness of spirit that led Mr. Nelson to donate his bone  marrow to a 14-year-old boy in France. He did not know the boy, he just  wanted to give something of himself to save a child's life.   He suffered a complication from the procedure. He never woke up.   Mr. Speaker, with the passing of Derrick Nelson, we have lost a  leader in our community and a great and good man. I extend my deepest  condolences to his family, and I hope they find comfort in knowing that  the extraordinary legacy he leaves behind will continue to inspire and  guide the people who had the privilege to know him.                            ____________________
