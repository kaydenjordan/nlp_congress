 Madam Speaker, upon his well-deserved retirement this  month, I rise today to recognize Plano police officer Art Parker on his  34 years of dedicated service to the city of Plano, Texas.   During his tenure as a school resource officer, Art made headlines  for his incredible ability to memorize the names of over 20,000  students.   A true public servant and a man of many talents, Officer Parker was  often seen playing extravagant harmonica solos, making balloon animals,  and, most impressively, making people laugh from their cars while stuck  in school traffic.   In 2015, Officer Parker was the first ever school resource officer to  be named Plano Officer of the Year. This came as no surprise to so many  inspired by his power to make others feel valued.   Officer Parker has made a lasting impact on the Plano community.  Although he will be missed, we know his future has wonderful things in  store for him. I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in  congratulating Officer Art Parker on his successful career and wishing  him luck as he begins his next chapter.                            ____________________
