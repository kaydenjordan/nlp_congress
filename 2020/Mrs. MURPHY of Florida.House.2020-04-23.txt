 Madam Speaker, today's bill is a positive  step and has my full support, but it took too long. Next time let's  skip the partisan games and just do our jobs.   We must be aggressive and smart. We should spare no expense when it  comes to testing, treatments, and vaccines. And we must support workers  and business owners who bear no blame for this crisis.   We should keep workers tethered to their jobs and to their  healthcare. And aid should be swift and direct rather than through  complicated and time-consuming programs. For workers who do lose their  jobs, Congress has provided billions to support them.   Sadly, this support has been delayed in States like Florida, whose  unemployment system is marred by incompetence and indifference.  Congress must demand better. Our country confronts a deadly, serious  crisis. As leaders, we must unite to combat COVID-19.   My fellow Blue Dog colleagues and I will continue pushing for more  bipartisan cooperation to get the job done for the American people.
