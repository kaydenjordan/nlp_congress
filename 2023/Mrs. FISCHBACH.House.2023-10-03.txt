 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Granite Falls  Mayor David Smiglewski.   On September 22, the mayor passed away after a long and courageous  battle with ALS.   Mr. Granite Falls, as many came to know him, began his service in  city government in 1979 as a member of the city council. In 1996, he  became the city's mayor and served in that role for 27 years until his  passing.   During his tenure, Dave's commitment as a leader and advocate never  wavered. He guided his community through devastating floods in 1997 and  2001 and a tornado in 2000.   He even spent his final days here in Washington, working to secure  highway funding for his community.   The people of Granite Falls and the people of Minnesota have lost one  of their greatest public servants.   We can all only hope to be more like Dave Smiglewski. I offer my  deepest condolences to Cindy, his wife of 40 years, and his children,  Cody, Seth, and Laurel.                            ____________________
