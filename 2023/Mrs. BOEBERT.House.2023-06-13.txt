 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in favor of my amendment which  will prohibit the administration from unilaterally implementing  extremely costly regulations that would result in the unavailability in  the United States of a type or class of product based on the type of  fuel the product consumes.   My amendment ensures that the Consumer Product Safety Commission  focuses on actual hazards with design rather than targeting fuel  sources.   We have a crisis at our southern border. Americans are worried about  being able to provide for their families and not pay $10 for a bag of  grapes. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is focused on controlling  the kind of stove Americans use in their homes.   Mr. Chair, 100 percent of the currently available freestanding gas  stoves and 96 percent of gas cooktops will not meet the new standards  proposed by the Biden administration's Department of Energy.   The Department of Energy estimates savings would average $1.50 per  year.   Mr. Chairman, do you know how much a gas stove that is compliant  under this proposed rule would cost on average?   Installation costs are anywhere between $3,600 on the high end to  $2,000 on the low end. Adding that to the cost of the stove puts you  out another $3,000 to $4,000, at least. Saying it will save consumers  money is a flat-out lie. Forcing people to switch to expensive  alternatives will only further increase costs for hardworking families  in my district and across America.   This reminds me a lot of when Mayor Pete said that if you can't  afford the price of gas due to the administration's anti-American  energy policies, then Americans should just shell out $40,000 to  $55,000 for a new electric vehicle.   This administration has proven to be completely out of touch.   Never mind the fact that Biden has also targeted dishwashers,  refrigerators, water heaters, furnaces, and air conditioners. On top of  families paying more for everyday costs due to Bidenflation, it is  clear this administration has prioritized pandering to Green New Deal  extremists rather than saving American families' hard-earned money.   I do thank my colleague, Representative Kelly Armstrong, for his  leadership to ensure the CPSC cannot abuse Federal funds to regulate  gas stoves.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment  as well as the underlying bill.    I yield to the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Chairman, what makes no sense is the speech that we  just heard regarding this amendment. There is so much of that that I  cannot even fathom to put together.   I am hearing a lot about hazards from gas stoves that would cause  harm for our children. I have four children. We have always had a gas  stove, and they are doing pretty well.   I can see that the gentlewoman from Illinois has made it pretty long  in her lifetime with the so-called dangers of gas products here in  America.   Mr. Chairman, let me tell you what really is hazardous. What really  is dangerous is the Green New Deal extremism that comes from the left  because they want to suppress our good, clean energy right here in the  United States of America that is cheap, that is reliable, and it is  actually something that is affordable for Americans right now, unlike  everything else because of the inflation that we are seeing from this  administration.   What is hazardous and what is really dangerous are the tens of  thousands of children who are mining for cobalt in Chinese-owned mines  in the Congo with their bare hands. That is what is dangerous, and that  is what this Green New Deal extremist policy encourages and pushes.   I have voted on so many bills for the Uighurs that are suppressed by  the Chinese, but we never talk about the slave labor that takes place  to produce the energy that the other side is trying to force on  Americans with their overreach of government policy. That is what is  dangerous.                                time  1700    An open border with fentanyl pouring over, that is dangerous.  Families not being able to afford to feed their family, that is  dangerous.   Mr. Chair, I urge the adoption of this bill that makes so much more  sense than the speech that we just heard from the other side of the  aisle.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
