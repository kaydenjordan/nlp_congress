 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the previous order, it be in order to offer my motion  to instruct at this time.    Madam President, I have a motion at the desk to instruct  conferees.    Thanks to a bipartisan effort in the Commerce Committee,  the Senate-passed U.S. Innovation and Competition Act includes nearly  $17 billion to support research, development, and supply chain support  at the Department of Energy National Laboratories, including key  technology areas, such as high-performance computing, advanced energy  technologies, artificial intelligence, quantum information science, and  advanced manufacturing. The House bill also includes robust support for  our National Labs.   This strong investment is critical to maintaining and strengthening  U.S. competitiveness and security, especially as global R&D  expenditures rise in these transformative industries.   Our National Labs are a research crown jewel, and other countries are  taking notice of our progress. In fact, China is working to build out  their own national lab network modeled after our own DOE Labs. Inaction  would leave the United States at risk of being rapidly outpaced.   New Mexico's own Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories are  leading the way in developing cutting-edge technologies in key focus  areas and driving innovation in critical national priorities, such as  next-generation microelectronics.   The Department of Energy's experience working with universities,  collaborating with the private sector, and protecting American  intellectual property from theft makes it a pillar of the U.S.  innovation ecosystem.                                Vote on Motion
