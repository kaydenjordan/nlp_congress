 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today I wish to report back to my  colleagues here in the Senate and to the American people about the  results of legislation which we passed here in the Senate and the House  and which was signed into law by the President. We don't do that often  enough, and we tend to pass legislation and don't do the oversight to  figure out whether it is working.   In this case, this was legislation we passed back in April on a  bipartisan basis called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act. This  legislation allows the victims of sex trafficking to get the justice  they deserve by being able to sue websites that knowingly trafficked  them online and have some accountability for these horrible crimes that  are committed online. It also allows prosecutors at the State and local  level to prosecute these cases.   We drafted the legislation because after looking at this for several  years, we realized that there was a rise in trafficking of underage  girls, women, and sometimes underage boys and that this was increasing  primarily because of the dark side of the internet. We are hearing a  lot about what is going on on the internet these days in terms of  meddling in our elections and so on. With all the positives, there is  also a darker side. We realized this was happening increasingly, and it  was a ruthlessly, efficient way to sell people online.   We looked at it and found there was a Federal law put in place--with  good intentions, I believe--a couple of decades ago to try to ensure  freedom of the internet, which, of course, all of us support, but it  provided an effective immunity to these websites even if they were  knowingly selling people online. So we wrote legislation to get at  that, spent about a year trying to get that through the process, and  eventually got it to a vote and got it passed.   The law that provided the immunity was part of the Communications  Decency Act. Again, it was meant to encourage freedom of the internet  but was taken too far, particularly in how it was interpreted by the  courts. The internet was something we had to address because without  that, we would see this increase in drug trafficking and sex  trafficking.   So what happened? After passing the law, there was a pretty dramatic  change.   On Monday, I was in Cincinnati, OH, my hometown, at a place called  the CHANGE Court. The CHANGE Court is a place where women who are  trafficked and incarcerated for prostitution are able to go through a  2-year program to help them get clean and, if they are willing to go  through this program, to walk away with a clean record, understanding  that sex trafficking is not a crime and that they are in effect victims  of trafficking.   It is very inspiring to go there. I talked to about a dozen women who  are currently in the program and some women who had graduated from the  program. The stories are unbelievable--women getting their lives back  together; getting back to work and getting back to their families; in  almost every case, getting back to their children--in almost every  case, these are moms; having the self-respect and dignity that comes  with work; getting back with their families; and getting their lives  back on track. It is a much better alternative than the system of  throwing people into jail who are, in effect, victims of trafficking  and not  [[Page S5101]]  dealing with their issues, whether it is the trauma or the drug  addiction. In almost every case, there was a drug addiction issue.  Almost all of them were opiate addicts or recovering addicts. One was  addicted to alcohol. This is common.   In talking to these women, almost every one of them said the same  thing, which was that, yes, they had been trafficked online, and they  were very interested in this legislation. They had been through it, and  they wanted to save future women and girls from having to go down this  dark path.   We passed the legislation and assessed the legislation meant to help  on this issue, and I was able to tell these women at the CHANGE Court  what the results were. They are pretty dramatic.   On Monday of this week, I also met with the National Center for  Missing and Exploited Children, or NCMEC. This is the leading anti- trafficking group in the country. They work day and night trying to  stop online sex traffickers. They keep track of the statistics and  data. They particularly focus on rescuing kids from being exploited.   According to NCMEC, the results from SESTA being signed into law has  been swift and significant. NCMEC said:         Since the enactment of SESTA and the government's seizure       of Backpage, there has been a major disruption in the online       marketplace. The robust marketplace for sex trafficking,       including the sale of children for rape and sexual abuse,       that took a decade to build, fragmented over the course of       just a few days.    They also said:         Many sites or portions of sites where NCMEC knew children       previously have been sold for sex have voluntarily shut down.    Their bottom line:         This means it is much harder to purchase a child . . .       online.    This means it is much harder to purchase a child online. That is  great news, and that is exactly what we intended this legislation to  do--to save these kids, women, and sometimes boys from being subjected  to this horrific crime.   Another analysis was shared with me recently, and you can find this  online. This analysis found that since our legislation passed, online  ads selling women and children have been reduced by between 60 and 80  percent, depending on the State. That is a dramatic change, having the  effect of saving literally thousands of children.   I am hopeful we will continue to be vigilant about this issue because  when you push something down in one place, it often pops up somewhere  else. But we have done an effective job of dealing with a very real  problem. Backpage.com, which we talked about, was the industry leader.  They have now been shut down. The CEO of the company has pled guilty to  numerous money laundering and trafficking-related charges.   Because prosecutors can now do their work and go after these online  traffickers and because victims of this crime can finally have their  day in court, websites that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking are  being shut down and being held liable for their actions.   This never would have been possible without the work of the Permanent  Subcommittee on Investigations. The staff and investigators spent 2  years working on this issue, investigating it. We had to come all the  way to the floor of this Chamber in order to enforce our subpoenas to  get the information that we were able to unveil, which no one else had  been able to find, and that showed clearly that they knew what they  remember doing. They knew they were selling underage kids online. I  chair that subcommittee. It is bipartisan. I am very proud of those  investigators. They do good work, and they deserve to be applauded,  given the results we are now seeing.   It is not just Backpage; a lot of other, classified websites have  also shut down their personal ads or sex-related operations.                            ____________________     We have made good progress on the issue of sex  trafficking, but it is so related to the issue of opioid abuse.  Specifically, as I said, these often go hand in hand. Often,  traffickers find people who are addicted. They are vulnerable, they  crave the drug, and the trafficker can provide it. But in my home State  of Ohio, I have met with survivors, and many times we have found that  they find vulnerable people who are not addicted but then make them  addicted so they become dependent on the trafficker.   This is an issue that relates to so many things, doesn't it? It  relates to our workplace because people who are addicted to opioids are  not coming into the workforce. One reason we have such high levels of  unemployment--people are outside the workforce altogether, not showing  up on the unemployment numbers because they aren't even looking for  work. The labor force participation rate, as economists call it, is so  low right now largely, in my view, because of this opioid issue. Our  courts are jammed, our jails are jammed, and our hospitals and  emergency rooms are jammed. We have to do more to get at this issue for  so many reasons.   The driving force in my home State of Ohio and around the country now  is this synthetic form of heroin or opioids called fentanyl. It is 50  times more powerful than heroin. There are other drugs--carfentanil is  an example--that are even more powerful. These synthetic forms of  opioids are causing most of the deaths now in my State of Ohio and  around the country.   The Centers for Disease Control, CDC, recently issued a report that  showed this increase in overdose deaths involving fentanyl. The report  analyzed overdose deaths in 10 States hit hardest by the epidemic,  including Ohio. They found that fentanyl overdose deaths in those  States nearly doubled from the last 6 months of 2016 to the first 6  months of 2017. Of course, 2017 is the last year for which they have  good records. It is unbelievable.   This synthetic form of heroin is the new scourge of the opioid  epidemic, and it is being spread into every other drug too. When I do  roundtables back home, as I do regularly, I hear about it being spread  into crystal meth, cocaine, and heroin, of course.   Twice in roundtable discussions I have had with community leaders, I  have heard--once from a police chief and once from a sheriff--very  similar stories about a young man who wakes up from an overdose after  being saved through Narcan, which is a miracle drug that reverses the  effects of an overdose. When the young man comes to, he says: I was  just smoking pot. How did I overdose?   In both cases, based on the forensics and the information they were  able to get from the labs, they found out that of course it wasn't just  marijuana; it was marijuana laced with fentanyl. No street drug is  safe. They can all kill you.    As I have met with these first responders, community leaders, and  those in recovery across Ohio--I just did recently with a group called  PreventionFIRST!--I have heard what is often brought up by those on the  frontlines; that is, that we would be making so much more progress  right now on this war against opioids--we have been successful here in  this Congress in passing more money for prevention, treatment, and  recovery, and those funds are starting to be used back home, and I see  it; I see the results, and there are some really exciting things going  on--but for the fentanyl. In other words, just as we were finally  making progress on prescription drugs and, then, on heroin, now this  fentanyl comes in and is creating even more problems. It is so  inexpensive, and it is so pervasive.   Recently, in Ohio, there were two busts where they were able to  apprehend people who were selling fentanyl and find this cache of  fentanyl they had. In both cases, it was a massive amount combined.  Just these two busts alone, there was enough fentanyl to kill half the  people in my State of Ohio. That is how bad it is.   Just last week, there was an autopsy that revealed that the death of  an Ohio police chief from Kirkersville, in the Columbus area, who was  caused by fentanyl. The report said: ``acute intoxication by  fentanyl.'' It was an accidental overdose.   I have told the story before of the police officer who brushed a  couple of flakes off his shirt after a bust. He didn't know it was  fentanyl. The flakes were the drug. It got into his skin through his  fingers, and he dropped to the ground unconscious and had an overdose.  It took several doses of Narcan to save his life.  [[Page S5102]]    Our first responders are in much more danger with fentanyl than they  have ever been, even with heroin, prescription drugs, and other  opioids. Addiction has taken too many lives in Ohio. Again, fentanyl is  the deadliest drug in this epidemic.   There was a recent estimation by a group called the Ohio Alliance for  Innovation in Population Health, which suggested that opioids are  responsible for more than 500,000 years of life expectancy lost in Ohio  between 2010 and 2016. Think about that: 500,000 years of lost life due  to opioids in Ohio, just in the 6 years between 2010 and 2016.   Often, these are lives of young people who had great promise ahead of  them and had become involved in this opioid epidemic, and the addiction  takes over, and it is more important than anything. It is more  important than their family, more important than their friends, more  important than their jobs, more important than their faith, and more  important than taking care of themselves. They end up, sadly, losing  their lives and all that opportunity and all the purpose God had for  them in their lives.   We need to turn the tide in this opioid epidemic. We can't do it, in  my view, unless we get at this issue of fentanyl because that is the  new scourge. We need to look at how it is coming, why it is coming, and  why it is so cheap.   Here is what is very interesting, and it might be surprising to some  people. It is not coming across the border from Mexico, or if it is, it  is very little of it. That is where the heroin is coming from, 90  percent of it. It is more pure than ever, more dangerous than ever. The  deadly fentanyl is mostly coming through the mail system. It is being  mailed into the United States of America, mostly from overseas, mostly  from China.   There are some evil scientists somewhere in China making this  fentanyl and then shipping it into your community. It is the No. 1  killer right now. By the way, opioid overdose and death is the No. 1  cause of death in my home State of Ohio. Nationally, it is now the No.  1 cause of death of people under 50 years old. It surpassed car  accidents. It is an epidemic. How could that be? What can we do about  it?   There is something we can do about it. We have to be sure that the  post office helps law enforcement to find these packages as they are  coming in and get these packages out of circulation so they don't come  into our communities and poison our families, our children, and our  neighbors. We have legislation to do that. It is called the STOP Act.   One-third of the Members of this Senate have now cosponsored that  legislation. We have now had it reported out of the Finance Committee  of the Senate. We need to get it to the floor and get it to a vote. It  is very simple. It is legislation that Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat of  Minnesota, on that side of the aisle, and I have come up with that says  the post office should have to do what any other carrier would have to  do--FedEx, UPS, DHL. Under law, they have to tell law enforcement in  advance what packages are coming in, where it is coming from, what is  in it, and where it is going. You have to provide that electronically  so you can use big data to sift through the millions of packages that  come in and to be able to find ones that are suspect and then  immediately use sophisticated equipment to scan and screen those and  pull out of circulation the ones that have fentanyl in them.   I have been to these distribution centers for these private carrier  companies. I have seen how they do it. I have seen the dangerous work  the Customs and Border Protection men and women are doing, using a room  that has significant ventilation. They have to have masks on and  gloves. They have to be very careful about it. Thank God, they are  there, because they are saving lives. If you send it through the mail  system, that very rarely happens.   We did a yearlong study of this in our Permanent Subcommittee on  Investigations, which I talked about earlier. We found a number of  things that were very troubling. One is just how easy it is to buy  fentanyl online. The second is the fact that when these drugs come in  through the post office, it is guaranteed delivery. The traffickers  will say if you send it by FedEx or another private carrier--UPS, DHL,  and others--it is not guaranteed. If you send it through the government  agency, no problem. That is not the way it should be.   By the way, letter carriers--the mail carriers in my community and  your community--want this fixed, too, because they care what comes into  their communities. They care about the people whom they serve, and they  want to be sure they are not delivering poison. They also are at risk,  just like anybody else is who is anywhere in that train.   I talked about the law enforcement officers. Think about the other  first responders who are using Narcan to revive people. They sometimes  get exposed to it. We have too many stories of little kids dying from  being accidentally exposed to fentanyl in a home where somebody is  using it. It is dangerous stuff. We have to fix this.   The information as to where it is from, where it is going, and what  is in it, when it is put into a digital format and can be analyzed  quickly through incredible intelligence that our Customs and Border  Protection people have, to be able to determine whether that package is  suspect or not, will make a huge difference in taking this offline and  keeping this poison from coming into our communities and ensuring that  we can, in fact, begin to stop some of the poison but, at a minimum, it  will raise the price by reducing the supply.   The post office, frankly, because of the pressure they have gotten  from Congress on this over the last few years have begun to start to  look at some of this. They have begun to provide some of the electronic  data. Based on testimony they provided for our subcommittee just  recently, they are now receiving data on about 36 percent of  international packages they transport into the country. Unfortunately,  of that 36 percent, just over one-third, about 80 percent of those  packages, are presented to law enforcement, and 20 percent get lost and  end up going into the system, into our communities, even though we know  they are suspect.   It is very inefficient right now. It is not working well. Plus, some  of the data is not decipherable. We have a long way to go. Even if all  36 percent were being delivered to law enforcement, that would mean  that 318 million international packages each year were coming in  without any screening--318 million packages.   The STOP Act is very simple. It holds the post office to the same  standard as private carriers--100 percent screenings. It requires that  by 2020 they get all this data on all the international packages  entering the United States.   It is a commonsense solution. It has already passed the House of  Representatives recently with a broad bipartisan vote. Our committee  has reported it out. We need to get it to the floor and get it voted  on. If we do so, by the way, it will be signed because the  administration has already issued a statement of administration policy  on it, which supports the legislation. It was actually a recommendation  of the President's commission on opioids. It is part of the solution.   Is it the whole solution? No, but it is a critical part to try to  stop some of this new poison, fentanyl, from coming into our  communities--the No. 1 killer--so that we can, through treatment and  recovery and better prevention efforts and better other law enforcement  efforts, truly begin to turn the tide on this opioid epidemic. It is  critical that we do so for so many reasons we have talked about this  afternoon.   My hope is that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will come  together, at least on this issue, on the STOP Act, and say yes, we can  do something to help those in our community who are suffering, those  who are dying from overdoses, those families who are looking to us and  saying: What can you do to help? I run into them all the time.   Today, I am heading back to Ohio, and I know this weekend I will be  talking to people in Cleveland and Cincinnati, where I will be, and in  Columbus, and they will be telling me about it.   This week, I was walking down the hall back to my office on Tuesday,  and a young man came up to me and said: I want to talk to you about  something.   I figured he was with the media and wanted to ask me a question. I  asked him what he wanted.  [[Page S5103]]    He said: I want to tell you thank you.   He started to well up, and I knew what he was talking about. He was  talking about a family member of his who had overdosed and died. He was  talking about the fact that he appreciates that Congress is finally  beginning to respond to this issue, as we have.   In the last year and after, we have passed legislation that is  historic to deal with this issue, but there is still so much more to  do. Let's make the next step getting the STOP Act enacted into law and,  therefore, be able to save lives and help people to live their God- given purpose in life.   I yield back my time.                            ____________________
