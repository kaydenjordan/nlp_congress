 Mr. Speaker, today the House will take a historic  step toward restoring American manufacturing leadership by voting to go  to conference on the COMPETES Act.   This bold bill makes much-needed investments in research, innovation,  and manufacturing that will ensure America can outcompete any nation in  the world now and for decades to come.   The package will accelerate domestic production of semiconductor  chips, the key component of everything from cars and computers to  communications and clean energy systems. It will strengthen the supply  chain to make more goods in America. It will create jobs and support  new skill-building apprenticeship programs, and it will support strong  labor and environmental standards.   What's more, the bill and its provisions have received bipartisan  support, both here in the House and over in the Senate. You heard that  right, Congress is delivering investments that will prepare our country  for the next generation of success.                            ____________________
