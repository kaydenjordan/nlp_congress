 Mr. President, I rise today to honor 14 exemplary  young Utahns who have answered the call of service to our country.   Each year, Members of Congress are authorized to nominate a number of  young men and women fro their district or State to attend our Nation's  service academies: the U.S. Air Force Academy, the U.S. Military  Academy, and the U.S. Naval Academy.   The men and women whom I nominated on behalf of the State of Utah  this year are some of the best and brightest in our country.   Each of these students is of sound mind and body, which will serve  them well in Colorado Springs, West Point, and Annapolis. But the  journey on which these young men and women will soon embark demands  more than strength of mind and strength of body. It demands strength of  character. It requires qualities of leadership, courage, honesty,  prudence, and selfdiscipline. It calls for a commitment to service and  a love of country. And ultimately, it requires a willingness to give  the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of the safety and security of our  Nation.  [[Page S3061]]    These students have already displayed the qualities of character and  the standards of excellence upon which our service academies are built.
