 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Johnstown, Pennsylvania, local, James Blachly, on his 2021  Grammy win.   In April 2018, Blachly and the Johnstown Symphony Orchestra performed  the U.S. world premiere of Dame Ethel Smyth's ``The Prison.'' It was  this performance that won the 2021 Grammy.   Serving as the music director of the Johnstown Symphony Orchestra and  as music director of the Experiential Orchestra, Mr. Blachly is known  for his innovative programming which aims to increase audience  engagement.   James is an incredibly talented conductor and composer. In 2016, he  was the only conductor from the United States invited to participate in  the first annual Young Conductors Showcase as part of El Sistema's 40th  anniversary celebration, and he was the only U.S. conductor to be  invited as Conducting Fellow in Maestra Marin Alsop's final year at the  Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music.   Congratulations to James and the Johnstown Symphony. Their hard work  and dedication have truly paid off.                            ____________________
