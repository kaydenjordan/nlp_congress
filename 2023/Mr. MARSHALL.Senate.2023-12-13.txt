 Madam President, I rise today to thank Dr.  Carter File for his many years of service to the State of Kansas and  Hutchinson Community College, as well as honor him for all that he has  accomplished during his career.   A dedicated educator committed to service, Carter began his journey  at Cloud County Community College as a student and later graduated from  Kansas State University, where he obtained a bachelor of arts degree in  accounting. After a brief hiatus from education, Carter went back to  school at the University of Baltimore, where he earned a master of  business administration, later pairing that with a doctor of philosophy  degree in educational studies from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.   In 2005, shortly before he began his doctoral work, Carter began his  service to the State of Kansas when he became the vice president of  finance and operations of Hutchinson Community College. Although he was  juggling school and work simultaneously, Carter hit the ground running,  quickly building rapport with the board of trustees, faculty and staff,  the local community, and the student body. Under his guidance,  Hutchinson Community College expanded its services; renovated sports  facilities for high school and collegiate use; revamped, with the help  of local entrepreneurs, the Richard E. Smith Science Center, and  dedicated the Bob and Lou Peel Allied Health Center, all of which  greatly contribute to better serving the people of Central Kansas.   With these accomplishments in hand, it is unsurprising that the board  of trustees at Hutchinson Community College decided to elevate Carter  to the presidency of the school in 2014. Following this promotion,  Carter continued to build on his prior successes. In  [[Page S5958]]  2015, he oversaw the construction of the Fire Science Training Center,  which the college completed in conjunction with the Hutchinson Fire  Department. A few years later, Carter orchestrated the opening of the  HutchCC Cosmetology Program, expanding the diversity of programs the  college offers its students. But perhaps Carter's crowning achievement  is being able to coordinate the support of the city of Hutchinson, the  voters of Hutchinson, and the college to garner the funds necessary to  revitalize the Hutchinson Sports Arena, which has brought nationwide  industry and acclaim to Hutchinson and throughout Central Kansas.   Carter will officially retire from Hutchinson Community College on  August 31, 2024, after over 24 years of service in higher education. I  now ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the distinguished  career of Dr. Carter File, as well as thank him for all his work on  behalf of the State of Kansas and Hutchinson Community College.                            ____________________
