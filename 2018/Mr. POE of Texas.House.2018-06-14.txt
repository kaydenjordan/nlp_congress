 Mr. Speaker, America's Peace Corps and those  volunteers are our angels abroad. They represent the very best in  America. Here with us today in the gallery, we have one of those brave  volunteers, Ms. Sara Thompson.   Since she was a little girl, Sara dreamed of helping rural  communities in Africa. When she grew up, the Peace Corps gave her that  perfect opportunity. She served in Burkina Faso, where she worked to  keep girls in school.   Unfortunately, her dream turned into a tragedy when the Peace Corps  prescribed medication called mefloquine to protect her from malaria.  During her service, she began to have horrific nightmares and struggled  with mental health.   When she turned to the Peace Corps for help, the medical officer  excused her symptoms as simply ``not adjusting well.'' One night, Sara  woke up dizzy, nauseous, and threw up the entire night, so she went to  the doctor, and the doctor told her it was an ear infection.   Months later still, Sara struggled with nausea and nightmares. And  with no support from the Peace Corps, she took matters into her own  hands and started to research those medical problems. It was then that  she realized the malaria medicine the Peace Corps had given her was  making her sick.   As it turns out, mefloquine's side effects are so terrible, Special  Operation Forces in the Army won't even take that medication. Sara was  never warned about these horrific side effects by the Peace Corps, and  the doctors in her post country didn't seem to recognize the symptoms  either.   Our Peace Corps volunteers deserve better. They deserve better care  than this, but, unfortunately, I have heard too many stories like  Sara's about Peace Corps volunteers. Young, enthusiastic volunteers  eager to make a difference in the world are let down by the  organization that they once held in such high esteem.   Peace Corps volunteers selflessly sacrifice years of their lives to  help people that they have never even met, often in some of the most  desolate, dangerous places on the globe.   Their service to our country should not turn into a nightmare that  ruins or even ends their lives because we don't take care of them.  Small, commonsense changes could make a big difference in protecting  our Peace Corps volunteers abroad and when they get home.   That is why Representative Kennedy and I introduced the Sam Farr and  Nick Castle Peace Corps Reform Act. This bill has passed our Committee  on Foreign Affairs and takes important first steps for our angels  abroad. It betters medical care for volunteers in the country, improves  training on the side effects of malaria medications, and allows the  Peace Corps to better prescribe other types of malaria medication.   In addition, this bill better protects our volunteers from sexual  assault and harassment when they are in foreign countries. When they  return, it extends their health coverage, so they can get the care they  need rather than stop taking care of them, as has happened in the past.   There is still more that needs to be done to ensure the safety and  security of those wonderful volunteers. They deserve to be protected by  the United States and our law when we send them to far reaches of the  world. When they return from service with injuries and sickness,  volunteers should be able to make ends meet with the disability payment  that they receive, which is not the case now.   Mr. Speaker, I hope to see these provisions in law some day, but  until then, the Sam Farr and Nick Castle Peace Corps Reform Act makes  critical improvements for our volunteers. It is essential to see it  become law.   Peace Corps volunteers like Sara are the face of our country in  places where America's shining beacon of hope and liberty to other  people may not always shine so bright without Peace Corps volunteers.  These individuals promote goodwill, a better understanding of the  United States, and this helps us secure enduring partnerships with  these nations.   It also does good in the country that they are in. They change lives  every day in local communities that they serve, and they do this many  times when they are alone. We must ensure we are doing all we can to  minimize unnecessary dangers for our Peace  [[Page H5158]]  Corps volunteers, both at home and abroad.   The Sam Farr and Nick Castle Peace Corps Reform Act is a crucial  first step, and I urge leadership to bring this bill to a vote soon.   As a former judge, I can tell you that it is our duty to do  everything within our power to protect these angels abroad. These  goodwill ambassadors like Sara Thompson are some of America's best, and  America must take care of them when they serve overseas, when they are  helping people overseas, and when they return home to America from  being overseas.   And that is just the way it is.    Mr. Speaker, our supposed Turkish allies are  holding Americans hostage.   At least two Americans, Andrew Brunson and Serkan Golge, are being  held by the Turkish regime on false charges. Dictator Erdogan, an  Islamist who has arrested thousands of Turks who oppose him, believes  that he can use imprisoned Americans as bargaining chips. He hopes that  he can trade American hostages for political opponents who fled  Turkey's dictatorship.   Even if the individuals Erdogan wanted had clearly committed crimes,  which there is absolutely no evidence they have, we should never engage  in rewarding Turkey for taking hostages.   Erdogan has proven he has no respect for the rule of law and,  instead, rules by fear. We must not assist him in his destruction of  democracy in Turkey.   American hostages like Pastor Andrew Brunson, who has been held for  more than 600 days, must be returned. Until then, the United States  needs to reevaluate whether Turkey wants to be considered a friend or  foe.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
