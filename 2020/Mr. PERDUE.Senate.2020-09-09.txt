 Mr. President, one of America's founding  principles is the belief that anyone of any background can achieve  anything with hard work, perseverance, and a positive attitude. This  belief is the very foundation of the American dream.   Mr. David Abney, who is retiring after over 40 years at Georgia's own  UPS, is the epitome of the American dream.   David grew up in the Mississippi Delta, which is one of the most  economically challenged areas in the country. Yet David didn't let his  circumstances determine his fate. From an early age, David worked odd  jobs to help support his family while making sure he kept his grades up  at school. This dedication paid off when he got into Delta State  University on scholarship, where he met his future wife, Sherry.   At the age of 19, while working as a package loader at UPS to pay for  his education, a manager recognized David's talent and work ethic and  encouraged him to join the company full time. Although he didn't  realize it at the time, this encouragement transformed David's life. It  was then that David became, as they say, ``brown-blooded,'' devoting  his career to UPS.   Although he had found his professional home, the road ahead wasn't  always easy. The work could be grueling. He moved around a lot. He  often put in difficult hours. However, just as he had diligently worked  his way into college, David worked his way up the ladder.   What has always made David an exceptional leader is his devotion to  the people who work for him. Having done the work himself, David  understood the needs and challenges of his employees, and he always put  their needs over his own. In one case, when the center he managed  experienced difficult times, David laid himself off so that his  employees could keep their jobs.   This selfless, employee-oriented leadership style eventually  propelled David to the highest levels of leadership at UPS. He became  COO in 2007, CEO in 2014, chairman of the board in 2016.   Under David's leadership, UPS has grown into one of the most  exceptional logistics companies in the world. He guided UPS through  major changes, adapting to the new needs of the digital world. He  focused on strengthening the company's diversity and inclusion  practices, so that anyone, of any background, would always find a home  at UPS just as he had.   Today, UPS supports hundreds of thousands of jobs and helps our  economy grow and thrive every day.   The values of hard work, optimism, and service to others that have  guided David's life are infused into the company that he has led. For  example, during the COVID-19 crisis, UPS helped manage logistics to  deliver critical aid to those who needed it. UPS workers put their own  health and safety at risk to serve their communities.   David's devotion to serving others extends beyond UPS. He has helped  support local businesses as the chairman of the Metro Atlanta Chamber  of Commerce. He served on the board of Catalyst, which works to bring  women, particularly women of color, into senior leadership positions.  He frequently supports his alma mater, so that the next generation of  bright young students can find success no matter where they come from.   As David Abney prepares to retire from UPS this year, he will be  leaving an incredible legacy of excellence, growth, and selfless  service. He has made UPS, the State of Georgia, and the entire country  a better place.   It is my pleasure to wish David, his wife Sherry, and their entire  family the very best.                            ____________________
