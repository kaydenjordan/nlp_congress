 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7909) to facilitate access to child care services safely and  securely during the COVID-19 pandemic, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7909         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ensuring Children and Child       Care Workers Are Safe Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Child care is an essential service that supports       children's early development and allows parents to work.        (2) At least 1 out of 2 child care providers closed at some       point during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2 out of 5 face the       possibility of permanent closure.        (3) The lack of access to child care services can prevent       parents from returning to work and can prevent children from       accessing critical services, including meals.        (4) Ensuring the safe re-opening and operation of child       care service settings during periods of community       transmission of COVID-19 will require child care providers to       adopt new measures and practices in order to reduce the       likelihood of COVID-19 transmission.        (5) Such measures and practices must ensure the safety of       children as well as child care workers, who may be at high       risk of infection.        (6) Ensuring that working families have access to safe       child care service options is critical to supporting young       children's development and to returning the economy back to       its pre-pandemic levels.       SEC. 3. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON THE SAFE PROVISION OF CHILD                     CARE SERVICES.         (a) Technical Assistance to States.--        (1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services       (in this Act referred to as the Secretary), in consultation       with the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention, shall provide technical assistance to States,       Indian Tribes, and tribal organizations related to the safe       provision of child care services while there is community       transmission of COVID-19. Such technical assistance shall       include information about--        (A) the prevention of COVID-19 transmission in child care       provider settings, including the use of face masks and other       personal protective equipment in such settings,        (B) training and professional development on health and       safety practices related to the prevention of COVID-19       transmission in child care provider settings,        (C) the acquisition and use of personal protective       equipment, and        (D) modifications of child care provider settings and       services to prevent COVID-19 transmission, such as optimal       staff-to-child ratios across such settings and the use of       mental health supports.        (2) Materials.--As part of such technical assistance       efforts, the Secretary shall--        (A) publish educational materials related to the prevention       of COVID-19 transmission in child care provider settings,       including by posting such materials on a website,        (B) update any such materials as necessary to reflect       advancements in the science of COVID-19, and        (C) provide a mechanism through which States may exchange       best practices relating to the safe operation of child care       providers.        (b) Technical Assistance to Child Care Providers.--        (1) In general.--The Secretary may make grants to lead       agencies designated under section 658D(a) of the Child Care       and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858b(a))       to provide guidance, technical assistance, and support to       child care providers, either directly or through resource and       referral agencies or staffed family child care networks,       regarding the safe operation of child care providers while       there is community transmission of COVID-19.        (2) Reservation.--The Secretary shall reserve 2.75 percent       of funds appropriated to carry out this section to make       payments to Indian Tribes, Tribal organizations, or consortia       of Indian Tribes and Tribal organizations.        (3) Allotments.--From amounts appropriated to carry out       this section and not reserved under paragraph (2), the       Secretary shall allot to Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin       Islands of the United States, and the Commonwealth of the       Northern Mariana Islands and to the remaining States amounts       in accordance with subsections (a)(1) and subsection (b) of       section 658O of the Child Care and Development Block Grant       Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858m), except that none of such       remaining States shall receive an allotment of less than       $10,000.

(c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 60 days after funds       are appropriated to carry out this Act, the Secretary shall       provide to the Committee on Education and Labor of the House       of Representatives and to the Committee on Health, Education,       Labor, and Pensions of the Senate a report that includes--        (1) recommendations for how to ensure the safe provision of       child care services while there is community transmission of       COVID-19, including recommendations that address each of the       issues described in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of       subsection (a)(1),  [[Page H4445]]         (2) recommendations for how to ensure the supply of child       care services meets demand during periods when providers       implement the recommendations described in paragraph (1),       including whether it will be necessary to expand the number       of child care providers to meet such demand and, if so,       recommendations for how to expand the number of child care       providers, and        (3) the estimated cost of implementing the recommendations       described in paragraphs (1) and (2).       SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.         The terms ``State'', ``Indian Tribe'', and ``Tribal       organization'' have the meanings given such terms in section       658P of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of       1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858n).       SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.         There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this       Act, $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2021. Funds appropriated to       carry out this Act shall remain available until expended.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7909, the Ensuring  Children and Child Care Workers Are Safe Act.   Access to high-quality, affordable childcare has always been  fundamental to the well-being of families and children, so it is not  surprising that childcare has emerged as one of the most urgent issues  facing families and communities during this pandemic.   I have spoken with parents who are struggling with how you balance  kids at home with work at home. I have heard from business owners,  economic development leaders, and local elected officials who are  worried about the workforce and the economy, and childcare has always  been an important part of all of these conversations because it is a  key factor in reopening our communities safely.   Many, and in some places most, childcare providers across the country  were closed during the early months of the pandemic. But now, they are  reopening and working hard to restore confidence and provide a safe  place for the children in their care.   Unfortunately, providers have told us that they have received little  direct guidance about how to modify their practices for COVID-19 to  keep children, families, and workers safe and that the guidance they  have received keeps changing and is oftentimes unrealistic. This makes  it difficult for providers to rebuild and to serve the number of  children they need to sustainably run their business and survive the  pandemic.   It is worth noting that even before the pandemic, this industry  operated on razor-thin margins and faced major difficulties.   According to a recent report from the American Institutes for  Research and Early Edge California, of the 278 California childcare  providers surveyed, 52 percent reported that it was too difficult to  understand or follow new requirements during COVID-19, and 79 percent  reported a significant need for guidance on how to implement new COVID- 19 health and safety protocols.   This important bipartisan bill before us today, introduced by my  colleagues Representative Finkenauer and Representative Guthrie, will  help meet this need by requiring the Department of Health and Human  Services, in consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, to issue educational materials and guidance on how to  provide childcare services safely during the pandemic.   Critically, this bill authorizes funding that will enable States to  provide direct outreach, technical assistance, and support to childcare  providers.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, Mr.  Guthrie, for his kind remarks.   Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Iowa (Ms. Finkenauer), the author of this important  bipartisan legislation.    Madam Speaker, may I please inquire how much time  remains on each side.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I wish to once again thank Representatives Finkenauer  and Guthrie for their leadership in crafting this urgently needed  bipartisan bill and all of my colleagues who have spoken in support of  the Ensuring Children and Child Care Workers Are Safe Act. This is such  an important issue.   Today's children are tomorrow's leaders. This bill will help make  sure that childcare providers who are entrusted with the health,  safety, and development of our Nation's very future have the support  they need to succeed.   I also want to note, as my colleague from Iowa noted, that the  consideration of this bill comes after the House passage of the Child  Care is Essential Act, which will provide $50 billion in direct grant  funding to help childcare providers cover operating expenses, purchase  PPE and cleaning supplies, pay providers through the pandemic and  beyond, and, importantly, give struggling parents relief from high-cost  copayments and tuition.   This is a good investment in our children, our families, our economy,  and our future. I continue to urge Senator McConnell and the full  Senate to take up the Child Care is Essential Act, as well as this  excellent bipartisan bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the legislation  before us today, H.R. 7909, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
