 Mr. Speaker, a recent Washington Post-ABC News  poll states that only 36 percent of Americans approve the job President  Trump is doing. But the results of this poll are flawed because it did  not use a representative sample of Republican and Democratic  participants.   This Washington Post-ABC NEWS poll used a population sample that was  35 percent Democratic and only 23 percent Republican, underrepresenting  Republican voters by about 10 percent.   As noted by strategist Jim McLaughlin, ``If the poll reflected the  actual electorate, Trump would be in mid-40s, which is what his  favorability rating was on election day when he won an overwhelming  electoral college victory.''   The same Washington Post pollsters gave Hillary Clinton a four-point  advantage over Donald Trump on the eve of the election. They  consistently predicted a significant Clinton victory, only to be proved  wrong. Their credibility is questionable.                            ____________________
