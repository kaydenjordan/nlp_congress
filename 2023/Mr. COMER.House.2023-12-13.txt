 Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure today to rise to  recognize two football powerhouses in the First Congressional District  of Kentucky upon their recent winning of State championships.   First of all, I recognize perennial State champion, the Mayfield  Cardinals on another class 2A State football championship, and I also  recognize the Boyle County Rebels on their three-peat as State  champions.   Mayfield won the 2A class title in Kentucky High School athletics and  Boyle County won the 4A. These are common achievements for both  football programs. I congratulate all the players, the staff, the  faculty, and the entire communities of Mayfield and Boyle County on  this great achievement.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H. Res. 918. Joe  Biden has repeatedly lied to the American people about his family's  corrupt influence-peddling schemes. He told the American people he  never spoke to his son about his family's business dealings. He claimed  there was an absolute wall between his official government duties as  Vice President and his family. He said that his family never made money  from China.   All of these are blatant lies. Our investigation has revealed how Joe  Biden knew of, participated in, and benefited from his family cashing  in on the Biden name around the world.   Since January we have learned some of the following:   The Bidens created 20 shell companies, most of which were created  when Joe Biden was Vice President. The Bidens and their associates then  raked in over $24 million through these shell companies from China,  Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Romania between 2014 and 2019. At  least 10 members of the Biden family have benefited or participated in  these schemes.   The Bidens layered these payments through their bank accounts to hide  the sources of the money. The banks even flagged many of these  transactions in more than 150 suspicious activity reports to the  Treasury Department.   One bank investigator was so concerned about Hunter Biden's financial  transactions with a Chinese company that he wanted to reevaluate the  bank's relationship with him. He noted that his transactions served no  current business purpose. That is what I call a shell company.   According to Devon Archer, a Biden family associate, Joe Biden was  the brand of the business. The brand showed up.   Joe Biden spoke to his son's associates by speakerphone more than 20  times, dined with foreign oligarchs and a Burisma executive, and had  coffee with Hunter's Chinese associate all when he was Vice President.   Weeks after Joe Biden left the Vice Presidency, money from this  Chinese Communist Party-linked entity began to make its way to the bank  accounts of several Biden family members.   Based on one Biden associate's interview with the FBI, these payments  were sent to the Bidens as a thank you.   Ask any Justice Department public corruption investigator about the  importance of payments received after one leaves public office. It is a  hallmark of corruption.   We are now at a pivotal moment in our investigation. We will soon  depose and interview several members of the Biden family and their  associates about these influence-peddling schemes, but we are facing  obstruction from the White House. The White House is seeking to block  key testimony from current and former White House staff. It is also  withholding thousands of records from Joe Biden's time as Vice  President.   Joe Biden must be held accountable for his lies, corruption, and  obstruction.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this necessary and  important resolution.
