 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  bipartisan supply chain subtitle found in the House-passed America  COMPETES Act.   We have all heard from our constituents over the last several months  about the impact that inflation has had on households and businesses.  We also know that a key reason for rising prices on critical goods is  our supply chain instability. The supply chain subtitle in the America  COMPETES Act will strengthen our supply chains and ultimately tackle a  root cause of inflation.   It is vital that this subtitle is preserved through the negotiations  of the America COMPETES Act as we build a better America. This is about  creating good-paying union jobs, protecting our national security, and,  ultimately, protecting the pocketbooks of the American people. Let's  get it done.                            ____________________
