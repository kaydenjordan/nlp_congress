 Mr. President, our Nation is mourning the end of an  exceptional American life. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg meant so much to  our country.   First and foremost, she was a brilliant, generational legal mind who  climbed past one obstacle after another to summit the very pinnacle of  her profession.   Justice Ginsburg was a fixture on our Nation's highest Court for more  than a quarter of a century. She was not just a lawyer--no, not just a  lawyer--but a leader. From majority opinions to impassioned dissents,  her life's work will not only continue to shape jurisprudence but also  enlighten scholars and students for generations.   By all accounts, Justice Ginsburg loved her work because she loved  the law. In a more ordinary life story, her courage and continued  excellence in the face of multiple serious illnesses would itself be  the heroic climax rather than just one more remarkable chapter among so  many.   On the Court, Justice Ginsburg was a universally admired colleague.  It is no wonder that many Americans have taken particular comfort these  past days in remembering her famous friendship with her ideological  opposite, the late Justice Scalia.   Together, they made sure the halls of justice also rang with laughter  and comedy. They rarely sat on the same side of a high-profile  decision, but they still sat together at the opera and most any other  time they could manage to be together.   The legal world is mourning a giant, but Justice Ginsburg's fellow  Justices, a legion of loyal law clerks, and countless many others are  mourning a close friend or a mentor. The Senate sends condolences to  them all.   Yet Justice Ginsburg's impact on American life went deeper still.  Friday's loss feels personal to millions of Americans who may never  have made her acquaintance.   Justice Ginsburg was a spirited, powerful, and historic champion for  American women to a degree that transcends any legal or philosophical  disagreement. As she climbed from the middle-class, Brooklyn, Jewish  roots, of which she was so proud, into the most rarefied air of law and  government, the future Justice had to surmount one sexist obstacle  after another.   Justice Ginsburg did not only climb the mountain; she blazed the  trail. Through deeds, through words, and simply through her example,  she helped clear away the cobwebs of prejudice. She opened one  professional door after another and made certain they stayed open  behind her.   Directly or indirectly, she helped entire generations of talented  women build their lives as they saw fit and enrich our society through  professional  [[Page S5720]]  work. Law and politics aside, no friend of equality could fail to  appreciate Justice Ginsburg's determination.   Finally, while Justice Ginsburg relished forceful writing and  detailed argument, she was also, in important ways, a uniter. In recent  years, many who consider themselves her admirers and might wish to  claim the Justice for their political ``side'' have come to embrace  reckless proposals to politicize the very structure of the Court  itself. But Justice Ginsburg remained unswerving in her public  commitment to preserving the neutral foundation of the institution she  loved.   The entire Senate is united in thinking of and praying for Justice  Ginsburg's family--most especially her daughter Jane, her son James,  her grandchildren, step-grandchildren, great-granddaughter, and  everyone who called her their own.                            ____________________     Mr. President, President Trump's nominee for this  vacancy will receive a vote on the floor of the Senate. Now, already,  some of the same individuals who tried every conceivable dirty trick to  obstruct Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh are lining up--lining  up--to proclaim that the third time will be the charm.   The American people are about to witness an astonishing parade of  misrepresentations about the past, misstatements about the present, and  more threats against our institutions from the same people who have  already been saying for months--well before this--that they want to  pack the Court.   Two years ago, a radical movement tried to use unproven accusations  to ruin a man's life because they could not win a vote fair and square.  Now they appear to be readying an even more appalling sequel. This time  the target will not just be the presumption of innocence for one  American but our very governing institutions themselves.   There will be times in the days ahead to discuss the naked threats  that leading Democrats have long been directing at the U.S. Senate and  the Supreme Court itself. These threats have grown louder, but they  predate this vacancy by many months. There will be time to discuss why  Senators who appear on the steps of the Supreme Court and personally  threaten Associate Justices if they do not rule a certain way are ill- equipped to give lectures on civics, but today let's dispense with a  few of the factual misrepresentations right at the outset.   We are already hearing incorrect claims that there is not sufficient  time to examine and confirm a nominee. We can debunk this myth in about  30 seconds. As of today, there are 43 days until November 3 and 104  days until the end of this Congress.   The late, iconic Justice John Paul Stevens was confirmed by the  Senate 19 days after this body formally received his nomination--19  days from start to finish. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, another iconic  jurist, was confirmed 33 days after her nomination. For the late  Justice Ginsburg herself, it was just 42 days.   Justice Stevens' entire confirmation process could have been played  out twice between now and November 3, with time to spare, and Justice  Ginsburg herself could have been confirmed twice between now and the  end of the year, with time to spare.   The Senate has more than sufficient time to process a nomination.  History and precedent make that perfectly clear.   Others want to claim that this situation is exactly analogous to  Justice Scalia's passing in 2016 and so we should not proceed until  January. This is also completely false.   Here is what I said on the Senate floor the very first session day  after Justice Scalia passed: ``The Senate has not filled a vacancy  arising in an election year when there was divided government since  1888, almost 130 years ago.''   Here is what I said the next day, when I spoke to the press for the  first time on the subject: ``[You] have to go back to 1888, when Grover  Cleveland was President, to find the last time a vacancy created in a  Presidential election year was approved by a Senate of a different  party.''   As of then, only six prior times in American history had a Supreme  Court vacancy arisen in a Presidential election year and the President  sent a nomination that year to a Senate of the opposite party. The  majority of those times, the outcome was exactly what happened in  2016--no confirmation--the historically normal outcome when you have  divided government.   President Obama was asking Senate Republicans for an unusual favor  that had last been granted nearly 130 years before then, but voters had  explicitly elected our majority to check and balance the end of his  Presidency. So we stuck with the basic norm.   And, by the way, in so doing, our majority did precisely what  Democrats have indicated they would do themselves. In 1992, Democrats  controlled the Senate opposite President Bush 41. Then-Senator Joe  Biden chaired the Judiciary Committee. Unprompted--unprompted--he  publicly declared that his committee might refuse to cooperate if a  vacancy arose and the Republican President tried to fill it.    In 2007, Democrats controlled the Senate opposite President Bush 43,  and with more than a year and a half left in President Bush 43's term,  the current Democratic leader declared that ``except in extraordinary  circumstances,'' the opposite-party Senate should boycott any further  confirmations to the Supreme Court. That is the current Democratic  leader a year and a half before the end of the Bush administration. So  in 2016 Senate Republicans did not only maintain the historical norm.  We also ran the Biden-Schumer playbook.   When voters have not chosen divided government, when the American  people have elected a Senate majority to work closely with the sitting  President, the historical record is even more overwhelming in favor of  confirmation. Eight such times in our Nation's history, new vacancies  have arisen and Presidents have made nominations, all during the  election year. Seven of the eight were confirmed, and the sole  exception, Justice Abe Fortas, was a bizarre situation including  obvious personal corruption that extended into financial dealings.   Apart from that one strange exception, no Senate has failed to  confirm a nominee in the circumstances that face us right now. Aside  from that one strange exception, no Senate has failed to confirm a  nominee in the circumstances that face us right now. The historical  precedent is overwhelming, and it runs in one direction. If our  Democratic colleagues want to claim they are outraged, they can only be  outraged at the plain facts of American history. There was clear  precedent behind the predictable outcome that came out of 2016, and  there is even more overwhelming precedent behind the fact that this  Senate will vote on this nomination this year.   The American people reelected our majority in 2016. They strengthened  it further in 2018 because we pledged to work with President Trump on  the most critical issues facing our country. The Federal judiciary was  right at the top of the list.   Ironically, it was the Democratic leader who went out of his way to  declare the midterm 2018 elections a referendum on the Senate's  handling of the Supreme Court. My friend, the occupant of the Chair,  was running that year. The Democratic leader went out of his way to  declare the 2018 midterms a referendum on the Senate's handling of the  Supreme Court.   In his final speech before Justice Kavanaugh was confirmed, he  yelled--literally, yelled--over and over at the American people to go  vote. He told Americans to go elect Senators based on how they had  approached their advice-and-consent duties over these weeks.  Unfortunately for him, many Americans did just that. After watching the  Democrats' tactics, voters grew our majority and retired four--four--of  our former colleagues who had gone along with their party's behavior.   We gained two seats. They lost four. That was the issue. Perhaps more  than any other single issue, the American people strengthened this  Senate majority to keep confirming this President's presumptive  judicial nominees who respect our Constitution and understand the  proper role of a judge.   In 2014, the voters elected our majority because we pledged to check  and balance a second-term, lame-duck President. Two years later, we  kept our word.  [[Page S5721]]    In 2018, the voters grew that majority on our pledge to continue  working with President Trump, most especially on his outstanding  judicial appointments. We are going to keep our word once again. We are  going to vote on this nomination on this floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceedings.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the postcloture time on  the Meyers nomination expire at 11:30 a.m. tomorrow and the Senate vote  on confirmation of the nomination. I further ask that if cloture is  invoked on the Lucas nomination, the postcloture time expire at 2:15  p.m. tomorrow and the Senate vote on the confirmation of the  nomination; finally, that following disposition of the Lucas  nomination, the Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the  Sonderling nomination.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 45.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  concurrent resolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  September 22; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that following  leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Meyers nomination under the previous order;  finally, that following the cloture vote on the Lucas nomination, the  Senate recess until 2:15 to allow for the weekly conference meetings.    Madam President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:49 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, September 22, 2020, at 10 a.m.
