 Mr. Speaker, in her formative years, Lena wore  turtlenecks and baggy clothes to school every day.   Why did she do so?   To hide the bruises that covered her entire body.   Soon, Lena's abusive foster mother lost custody of her. And when her  foster mother lost custody, Lena just ran away. She was 13.   After bolting from the front lawn at the Houston middle school, she  ran into a friendly-looking stranger, and that is when she discovered a  false sense of comfort in the hands of a dastardly human trafficker. He  offered to look after her, protect her, and love her; that was if she  made him a little money. And he offered her the one thing she was  missing in her 13 years, someone who said they loved her.   Mr. Speaker, love doesn't come with black eyes and bruises, however.  The trafficker even promised Lena drugs so she could focus on something  else while she was having sex with the buyers of children.   For the next 3 months, Lena would have many different traffickers and  many different buyers. She would spend a few months or weeks with them,  moving from motel to motel, then she would get scared and try to go  back to foster care, and then just disappear again.   Finally, she was arrested after police responded to an internet post  advertising sex with children. They arrested her trafficker in the  hotel next door. With her help, the police ultimately charged two  individuals with forcing a child into prostitution, or human  trafficking, as we call it.   Upon her arrest, it was revealed that not only did she have three  sexually transmitted diseases, she was also pregnant.   The problem then, Mr. Speaker, is that Lena had nowhere to go.  Authorities found themselves with an abused, traumatized, demoralized  trafficking victim, a child, on their hands. Remember, Lena was a  victim of crime. She was not a criminal. Children cannot be willing  prostitutes under the law.   But there were no resources to put her anywhere, no resources to get  her help and the support that she needed. The very limited number of  nearby trafficking shelters were all full and there was no place to  send her, so she was locked up in the county jail.   Victims of trafficking, Mr. Speaker, do not belong in shackles and  orange jumpsuits. They belong in safe, nurturing environments. They  deserve to have access to resources and help to get their stolen lives  back for them.   How can a victim begin to recover, while a child, languishing in  jail?   The justice system failed Lena and many others just like her, but it  doesn't have to be this way. Lena deserves justice.   Sitting here in Washington, D.C., there is a victims' fund totaling  over $12 billion. Money in this fund comes from fines and fees imposed  on convicted felons, people like deviants who trafficked Lena.  Unfortunately, year after year, only a small amount of this money is  actually taken out of the fund to help victims. Most of it stays in the  fund and is used by appropriators to offset the costs of their pet  projects that have nothing to do with victims of crime.   This is not acceptable, Mr. Speaker. The money, remember, is not  taxpayer money. It is money that comes from criminals when they are  convicted in Federal court, and we should give this money to victims of  crime.   Money in the fund should be spent only on what victims like Lena  desperately need so that they can get their lives back together and  recover from the trafficking abuse they suffered.   Lena and other trafficking victims deserve justice. They deserve the  money that is in the fund, and bureaucrats need to quit using that  money as an offset for other projects. The victim fund is partially the  answer.   Mr. Speaker, this should be spent on victims of crime because no  trafficking victim belongs in the shackles of a county jail.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, over 260 Americans have traveled to  Iraq and Syria to fight for known foreign terrorist organizations. When  they return back to America, they are not coming back to open up coffee  shops. They are coming back to do mischief against us.   The most important job of government is to protect the citizens. That  is why my colleague, Bill Keating, and I have introduced the Foreign  Terrorist Organization Passport Revocation Act. It directs the  Secretary of State to revoke passports of those Americans who have  joined foreign terrorist organizations. They are still citizens, but  they cannot travel back to the United States or to any other country.  The only way they come back to the United States is under arrest by law  enforcement in handcuffs.   This is a bipartisan bill that will stop these Benedict Arnolds from  coming back at all. If someone takes arms up with our enemies, that  person deserves to be treated like an enemy.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
