 Madam President, a powerful tornado stretched across 200  miles, never leaving the land, and perhaps the longest streak of  tornado destruction we have ever seen in the United States of America.  And my heart goes out to all those families who have been so impacted,  all those who are lost, all those who are without a home, all those  whose lives have been turned upside down.   We, the Senate, must act to be supportive of our fellow Americans who  have faced such incredible destruction.
