 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3755,  the deceitfully named Women's Health Protection Act. This legislation  constitutes a radical assault on the sanctity of life and the dignity  of the most vulnerable Americans.   I am grieved and shocked beyond words that Democrats are moving to  force States across the country to accept abortion on demand, right up  until the moment of birth. Along with so many Americans, I believe that  life is beautiful, and that all babies must be given the opportunity to  thrive. And yet, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to  eradicate every legal protection these little ones have, rather than  welcoming them with the love and joy and hope that they deserve.   This bill gives abortionists the ability to decide which precious  infants are ``viable'' and worthy of life. It prioritizes the  profitability of the abortion industry over genuine and compassionate  care for mothers and children.   No baby should be discarded because they were allegedly unwanted, and  no mother's needs should be subjugated to the demands of the abortion  lobby.   This is an incredibly urgent time in our Nation. I implore each and  every one of my colleagues to stand up and fight for those who cannot  protect themselves.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 3755.                            ____________________
