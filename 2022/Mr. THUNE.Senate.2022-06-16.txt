 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted  to speak for up to 15 minutes, Senator Moran for up to 7 minutes, and  Senator Tester for up to 10 minutes prior to the scheduled rollcall  votes.    Mr. President, before I begin, I would like to take a  brief moment to wish the U.S. Army a happy 247th birthday.   I had the special honor this morning to ``fall in'' with Secretary of  the Army Wormuth, Army Chief of Staff McConville, Sergeant Major of the  Army Grinston, many other Army leaders, and hundreds of soldiers for  some morning PT.   I appreciated the opportunity to join in the Army tradition of a  birthday formation run, and it was especially humbling to run through  the hallowed grounds of Arlington National Cemetery.   Any time you are in Arlington--or any national cemetery in the  States, like the Black Hills National Cemetery in South Dakota, or  overseas, like the Normandy American Cemetery--you are reminded of the  sacrifice and legacy of our Nation's warfighters. Every name and pair  of dates on a headstone tells a unique story of selfless service to our  Nation.   In running over the hills and around the turns this morning, you get  a better sense of the magnitude of the more than 400,000 Americans who  are honored at Arlington and the collective sacrifice of all of  America's heroes.   Today, the U.S. Army proudly carries on the heritage and legacy  established on June 14, 1775. Our soldiers and all our men and women in  uniform stand guard around the world to protect our freedoms, and they  make any adversary think twice about threatening them, as the U.S. Army  has done for the past 247 years.   Thank you for all of your service to our country, your  professionalism, and determination, and thank you for including me  today. Happy birthday to the U.S. Army.                               Rural Broadband    Mr. President, as a longtime member and former chairman of the Senate  [[Page S2988]]  Commerce Committee and as a resident of a rural State, I have long been  focused on expanding rural broadband access and ensuring that the  benefits of the next wave of mobile broadband, 5G, are fully realized  in rural communities.   Expanding rule broadband access has been embraced by Members on both  sides of the aisle, and Congress has appropriated billions of dollars  in recent years to ensure that rural communities are able to access  fixed broadband. It is encouraging to see Members on both sides of the  aisle supporting this goal, but there are problems. While, as I said,  Congress has appropriated billions of dollars toward this goal, the  Federal Government lacks an overarching broadband strategy.   As a recent Government Accountability Office report highlighted,  rural broadband funding is spread out over 15 separate Agencies and  more than 130 separate programs in our government. That doesn't exactly  make for outstanding efficiency or coordination. What it does make for  is wasted taxpayer dollars and slower progress in ensuring that our  rural communities have access to broadband.   Last week, the Senate Commerce Committee's Communications  Subcommittee, of which I serve as ranking member, held an oversight  hearing on one of the leading Agencies charged with expanding rural  broadband access and promoting wireless access, the National  Telecommunications and Information Administration, or the acronym is  NTIA. I appreciated Assistant Secretary Davidson coming to testify  before the committee.   Last year, Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs  Act, which provided billions of dollars to NTIA to deploy broadband  services to unserved areas throughout the United States. At the time  the bill was debated, I raised a number of concerns about NTIA's  ability to effectively and efficiently manage such substantial funding,  given NTIA's past history on expanding rural broadband services. The  last time Congress provided NTIA with broadband funding--a fraction, I  might add, of the funding it is now responsible for--the Agency  struggled with implementation and ended up overbuilding existing  broadband networks, resulting in billions of taxpayer dollars being  spent with little to show. And I have to say, I have not seen a lot to  convince me that NTIA will do a better job this time around.   Last month, NTIA released its Notice of Funding Opportunity for the  Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment--or BEAD--Program. The notice  contains a number of troubling components. To begin with, I am  concerned that NTIA is planning to base its funding allocations on maps  that don't accurately reflect which areas of the country are unserved.  This creates a substantial risk of misallocating the funding Congress  appropriated and, once again, overbuilding existing networks at the  taxpayers' expense.   NTIA's notice also makes clear that when it comes to expanding  networks, they are planning to favor certain applicants; specifically,  government-run networks and nontraditional broadband providers-- entities with no proven track record in deploying broadband networks.   What NTIA should be doing is taking a neutral approach that allows  equal participation from all types of broadband providers, as long as  they meet the technical, financial, and operational standards to deploy  networks.   Finally, especially at a time of record high inflation, the last  thing any Agency should be doing is pursuing extraneous political goals  that will ultimately increase the cost for providers who are deploying  networks. I am disappointed that NTIA, like other Federal Agencies  under this administration, is seeking to score political points with  certain constituencies--in this case, by leaning into net neutrality  requirements, promoting burdensome labor standards, and focusing upon  climate change initiatives.    NTIA's focus on requiring broadband providers to use a unionized  workforce or project labor agreement not only puts providers that do  not use union workforces at a disadvantage, but it is unworkable-- unworkable--for providers in rural communities like those in South  Dakota that simply don't have access to a unionized workforce.   Earlier this month, I heard firsthand from the folks who are building  out networks in my home State of South Dakota about the challenges they  face with respect to supply chain shortages and increased construction  costs, and including unnecessary requirements in broadband contracts  will only exacerbate that problem.   I will continue to urge NTIA to work with States to reduce, rather  than increase, regulatory burdens so that the funding Congress provided  could be used to provide broadband access to as many Americans as  possible.   I also continue to work on other measures to expand broadband access  in rural communities, including the Reforming Broadband Connectivity  Act, which I joined colleagues from both parties to introduce last  year.   This legislation will help guarantee a stable funding stream for the  Federal Communication Commission's Universal Service Fund, which  promotes universal access to broadband and other telecommunications  services. And I am hoping--I am hoping--we can get this legislation  enacted into law this year.   Having reliable rural fixed broadband services is also key in  ensuring that rural communities are able to access the next wave of  mobile broadband internet, 5G, and I am committed to smoothing the path  for 5G services.   Mr. President, 5G offers tremendous potential for rural communities,  whether it is better access to telehealth or the opportunity to  implement precision agriculture. And we need to ensure that we build  out 5G networks not just in cities and in suburbs but in rural  communities across the United States.   I have introduced a number of bills to help keep the United States at  the forefront of the 5G revolution and ensure that 5G technology makes  its way to rural communities.   My STREAMLINE Act, for example, would expedite the deployment of the  small cells that are needed for 5G installation, while respecting the  role of State and local governments in making deployment decisions.  And, importantly, it would make it more affordable to bring 5G to rural  areas by addressing the costs of small cell deployment.   On the spectrum side of the equation, this year, I introduced the  Spectrum Innovation Act, along with the Communications Subcommittee  chair, Senator Lujan, to free up additional midband spectrum for 5G  deployment, an action that will simultaneously improve 5G coverage and  bring in revenue for deficit reduction.   Since freeing up additional spectrum requires proper coordination  between NTIA, the FCC, and other Federal Agencies, I joined Senators  Wicker, Blackburn, and Lujan to introduce the Improving Spectrum  Coordination Act to ensure that our Federal partners are effectively  managing our Nation's airwaves.   On the workforce side of things, my Telecommunications Skilled  Workforce Act, which was enacted into law last year, is designed to  help increase the number of workers enrolled in 5G training programs  and identifying ways to grow the telecommunications workforce to meet  the demands of 5G.   I will continue to work to support every part of the 5G equation-- from physical technology to spectrum, to a 5G workforce--so that the  United States can stay at the forefront of this internet revolution. I  will also continue to make fixed broadband and 5G access in rural  communities a priority.   Too often, rural areas, like those in my home State of South Dakota,  have lagged behind when it comes to getting the most modern internet  technology, and I am committed to ensuring that the full benefits of  next-generation technologies make their way to rural communities.
