 Mr. Speaker, I had planned to come down to the floor  here to manage some bills here in a couple of minutes, but I decided I  needed to take this opportunity to address some of the things that the  American people might have been hearing from the other side of the  aisle just now.   This is absolutely just political demagoguery what is going on.  Frankly, it is political malfeasance. This is about simplification.  This is about fairness. This is about making sure that hardworking  American men and women and their families have the opportunity to live  the American Dream.   Right now, we have a Tax Code that is massive, first of all. Second,  it is filled with loopholes and exceptions that lobbyists and the well  connected have put in there over the last number of decades. It is time  to change that. The American people deserve this.   There is real tax relief for real working families, and that is why I  think you are seeing such enthusiasm out of the American people for  this tax plan.  [[Page H8609]]                                ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from Colorado  allowing me an opportunity to speak on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, currently, the Securities and Exchange Commission  prohibits the sale or delivery of securities that have not been  registered with the agency.   A large portion of startups--and, really, these are ideas--rely on  small, nonprofit offerings also known as private placements, such as  with friends and family. They do a round of offerings in order to raise  initial, early-stage seed capital; however, the Securities Act of 1933  does not define what constitutes a public offering or, conversely, a  nonpublic offering. As a result, startups may unintentionally violate  the act when it seeks to offer securities to potential investors in a  private placement.    Let's put that in real English. Let's make this actually approachable  in a way that I think true American entrepreneurs can understand.   The reality is, these are people with an idea, a drive to move  forward and to improve something. They go and offer to their family, or  maybe ask of their family, to be a part of that dream, to help with  some seed capital, to give them a little bit of their hard-earned money  to help them achieve their dream.   And, guess what?   They get to take part in the success of that. There is some risk, but  there is also reward.   How this really translates is that there might be the doctor who has  got a great idea for a new health drink or a new implement to use while  he is in surgery. This might be a mom who left the workforce and was  taking care of her kids and said: There has got to be a better way of  making sure my kids are getting a healthy meal transported to school;  or something like that.   These are people who are looking around and saying: I can go make  life better not for me, not just for my family, but for others. They  are then trying to pursue that.   To address this uncertainty that we have, H.R. 2201, the Micro  Offering Safe Harbor Act, would implement a simple amendment to the  Securities Act of 1933, by making clear what constitutes a nonpublic  offering.   It is going to provide small businesses with needed clarity and  confidence to know that their offering is not a Securities Act  violation. Think of that. Again, it might be that doctor or that stay- at-home mom who is out there just trying to fund an idea,  unintentionally and with no malice or no understanding that they are  violating Federal law.   A micro-offering authorized under this bill would allow small  businesses or small entrepreneurs to operate with confidence, and the  commonsense requirements to be a part of this are such:   Each investor has a substantive preexisting relationship with an  owner. This is no fly-by friendship. This is somebody who you actually  know;   There are fewer than 35 purchasers or investors; and   Also, the amount cannot exceed $500,000.   If you just divide out $500,000, which is a lot of money, by 35  people, that is less than $15,000 a person. That is $14,285, to be  exact. This is not about helping Wall Street somehow, for crying out  loud. This is about Main Street.   I believe it is important to note, as the sponsor, Mr. Emmer, had  noted earlier, that nothing in this bill would remove or inhibit the  authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Department  of Justice from prosecuting securities fraud.   With antifraud protections still in place, the legislation  appropriately scales Federal rules and regulatory compliance costs for  these small businesses and entrepreneurs.   H.R. 2201 is a commonsense bill designed to help Main Street and not  Wall Street. Simply put, it will allow these small businesses and  entrepreneurs, these DREAMers, to access capital necessary for their  growth.   As I said, Representative Emmer has done a phenomenal job in  shepherding this through. In a 2016 Capital Markets, Securities, and  Investments Subcommittee hearing where we dealt with the bill, he had a  great quote that said:   ``The problem with the ability of small businesses to effectively use  this exemption is--the term `private offering' is not defined in law.  Not only does this prevent small business from using the exemption, it  leaves businesses who try to use the exemption and can't afford a team  of expensive lawyers--which, again, most small businesses cannot-- exposed to potential lawsuits and future liability. . . . This  legislation will create a bright line safe harbor for small private  offerings. It will help entrepreneurs open new businesses and expand  existing ones.''   Mr. Speaker, I applaud the hard work of my colleague, Mr. Emmer, on  this bill, and I encourage all my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R.  2201.
