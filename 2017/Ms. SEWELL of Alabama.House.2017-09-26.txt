 Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition,  although I am not opposed to the amendment.    First, I would like to thank Chairman Brady as  well as Chairman Smith for honoring their commitment to work with me to  ensure that the most needy rural communities are not neglected in this  bill.   I am glad to see that the language I proposed during the committee  markup last week has been included in the Smith amendment.                                time  1430    Both my friend from Nebraska and I represent rural America, and we  understand the obstacles that our rural constituents confront on a  daily basis. Moreover, we both believe in the mission of the MIECHV  Program, and we see how effective it has been in both rural and urban  communities.   One of the reasons why the MIECHV Program is good policy is because  of the program's flexibility. While models like the Nurse-Family  Partnership can be successful in urban and suburban areas, other  evidence-based models like HIPPY--or Home Instruction for Parents of  Preschool Youngsters--can be incredibly effective in rural areas that  tend to have fewer resources.   This amendment language, which I offered during the committee markup,  ensures that rural communities with little resources are not skipped  over. This is a simple and commonsense fix that has bipartisan support  as well as the support from the Home Visiting Coalition.   While I appreciate my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for  working with me to fix this language, I have to say that I am  disappointed that none of the other commonsense amendments offered by  my Democratic colleagues were accepted during the markup.   For years, the MIECHV Program has enjoyed bipartisan support, but I  am afraid that Republican changes in the underlying legislation we are  considering today, I believe, will hurt the MIECHV recipients in the  long-term viability of the program.   While I oppose the final passage of the underlying bill, I, again,  want to thank my friend from Nebraska, as well as Chairman Brady, for  accepting my markup amendment language, and I urge my colleagues to  support the Smith amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
