 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Elijah McClain, a  young Black man from Aurora, Colorado, who died in police custody. He  was 23 years old.   Before coming to the floor today, I asked Elijah's mother what she  wanted to tell the world about her son, and here are her words:  ``Elijah spread joy everywhere he went. He was a lover of all beings.  He dedicated his energy to healing others through his work as a massage  therapist and playing his violin at the animal shelter to keep them  from being lonely. Elijah's name will live on in the hearts of all who  knew him.''   Colorado was blessed by Elijah's legacy, and last week, we passed the  most transformative police bill in the country.   Tonight, it is Congress' turn to do the same. I urge my colleagues to  join me and pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The time for  talk in Congress is over. My vote tonight will be cast for Elijah  McClain.
