 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 589, the  Department of Energy Research and Innovation Act, sponsored by my  friend and the chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee, Representative Smith.   This bipartisan bill advances basic research and sets explicit  science priorities for the Department of Energy, which is critical for  our future innovation.   H.R. 589 also authorizes the core program in my bill, the Low-Dose  Radiation Research Act, which unanimously passed the House earlier this  year.   The provision directs the Department of Energy to carry out a  research program on low-dose radiation, which will increase our  understanding of the health effects low doses have on biological  systems.   Research has consistently shown us the adverse health effects  associated with high doses of radiation, but we are a long way from  accurately assessing the effects of low doses of radiation.   As a product of industrial activities, medical procedures, and  naturally occurring systems, humans are exposed to low doses of  radiation every day, and it is imperative we can accurately assess this  risk.   There is broad consensus among the radiobiology community that more  research is necessary for Federal agencies, physicians, and related  experts to advance the use of radiation technologies. We have  invaluable diagnostic tools today, such as CT scans, which emit low  doses of radiation. It is vital physicians are able to inform patients  of the health risks associated with these types of imaging processes.   As a physician in my home State of Kansas, I certainly have firsthand  understanding of the crucial importance of verified research and  ensuring the best medical outcomes for our patients.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this bill, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.                                time  1430
