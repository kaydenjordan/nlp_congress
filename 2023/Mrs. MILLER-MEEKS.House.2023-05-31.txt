 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize fifth grade  students from Mid-Prairie Middle School in Kalona, Iowa, for serving as  an excellent example of how young Americans can have a positive impact  on their communities. They spent the last few months learning about  financial literacy and entrepreneurship by starting their own endeavor  selling candy to other students in the district, with the goal of  donating their profits to a local animal shelter.   What the students and teachers didn't know when they started the  business was how successful it would become. With an initial goal of  raising $100, they blew everyone away when they presented their grand  total of $750 to the local shelter this past Tuesday. The money will go  toward saving the lives of countless animals in need of a home.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have such bright young entrepreneurs in my  district. When they ask if you are smarter than a fifth grader, I would  say to look to Kalona Mid-Prairie Middle School.                            ____________________
