The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided among and controlled by the respective chairs and       ranking minority members of the Committees on Education and       Labor, Energy and Commerce, and Ways and Means, or their       respective designees; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 4.  House Resolution 188, agreed to March 8, 2021 (as       most recently amended by House Resolution 900, agreed to       February 2, 2022), is amended by striking ``April 1, 2022''       each place it appears and inserting (in each instance)       ``April 29, 2022''.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.  Fischbach), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House  Resolution 1017, providing for consideration of two bills. The rule  provides for consideration of H.R. 3617, the MORE Act, under a  structured rule. The rule self-executes a manager's amendment from  Chairman Nadler, provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  the Judiciary, makes three amendments in order, and provides one motion  to recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 6833, the Affordable  Insulin Now Act, under a closed rule. The rule self-executes a  manager's amendment from Chairwoman DeLauro, provides 1 hour of debate  equally divided among and controlled by the chairs and ranking minority  members of the Committees on Education and Labor, Energy and Commerce,  and Ways and Means, and provides one motion to recommit.   Finally, the rule extends recess instructions, suspension authority,  and same-day authority through April 29, 2022.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased we are here today to provide for  consideration of Chairman Nadler's MORE Act, which would end decades of  failed and unjust marijuana policy.   Today, 18 States, two territories, and the District of Columbia have  laws legalizing and regulating commercial cannabis, and a total of 37  States, three territories, and the District of Columbia have laws  allowing cannabis for medical purposes. An additional 11 States have  low-THC medical cannabis laws.   This means a total of 47 States, four territories, and the District  of Columbia have laws allowing some use of cannabis; 97.7 percent of  the U.S. population live in these States and territories. It is clear  Prohibition is over.   Today we have an opportunity to chart a new path forward on Federal  cannabis policy that actually makes sense. The MORE Act is about  justice, safety, equity, and States' rights. The bill would  decriminalize cannabis at the Federal level by removing the substance  from the Controlled Substances Act, but the bill does not force a State  to legalize any form of cannabis. It is still up to the States to set  their own policy.   The bill also contains provisions on resentencing and the expungement  of criminal records. There is no reason why people should still be in  prison for low-level, nonviolent cannabis convictions, or have their  future predetermined by a cannabis conviction. The war on drugs has  torn many families and communities apart and has had a disproportionate  impact on people of color. The MORE Act would allow communities to  start the healing process.   By removing cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, the bill  also addresses the cannabis banking problem that I have been working on  for nearly  [[Page H4024]]  10 years in the form of the SAFE Banking Act. Under current law, banks  and credit unions providing services to State-licensed cannabis  businesses are subject to criminal prosecution and regulatory penalties  under Federal law. Therefore, businesses which legally grow, market, or  sell cannabis in States where it is legal are generally locked out of  the banking system, making it difficult for them to maintain a checking  account, access credit, accept credit and debit cards, meet payroll, or  pay tax revenue.   This has created a significant public safety risk, as these  businesses are forced to operate as cash-only businesses in an industry  with billions and billions of dollars in transactions. These high- volume cash businesses are being targeted by violent criminals and  putting our communities at risk.   I want to share a few examples of how bad the public safety issue has  become.   In November 2021, over the course of one week in Oakland, California,  more than 25 cannabis businesses had their stores vandalized and robbed  and lost upwards of $5 million.   A Colorado dispensary chain saw 15 burglaries during a 90-day period  in mid-2021, with criminals driving vehicles into their buildings,  cutting holes through rooftops and walls, and attacking the stores with  pry bars and sledgehammers.   Washington State is averaging more than a robbery per day at  dispensaries. In fact, recently in The Seattle Times, it was reported  that there were three deaths related to robberies of dispensaries--the  robber, a policeman, and owner of a store. This is just last week.   This is an untenable situation for these businesses, their employees,  and their customers. If Congress fails to align Federal and State law,  crimes targeting dispensaries will only get worse. The cannabis  industry remains one of the fastest-growing industries and now supports  more than 428,000 jobs, with nearly $25 billion in State-legal cannabis  sales per year. The time to pass the MORE Act and right the injustices  in our community is now.   This rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 6833, the  Affordable Insulin Now Act, to address skyrocketing insulin costs. Over  37 million Americans have been diagnosed with diabetes, and in Colorado  there are over 300,000. The Affordable Insulin Now Act will require  Medicare Part D and health insurance plans to cover insulin and cap  out-of-pocket cost-sharing at $35 per month.   Prescription drugs like insulin force Coloradans to make difficult  financial decisions. In a 2020 report from the Colorado Attorney  General, approximately 40 percent of all survey respondents reportedly  using insulin are forced to ration their use of this lifesaving product  at least once a year.                                time  1230    I am proud of the steps Colorado has taken to ensure individuals have  greater access to insulin. In 2021, Colorado became the second State in  the country to limit insulin prices by enacting an insulin  affordability program.   No one should have to pay more than $35 a month for insulin. The  passage of this legislation will lower costs for insulin users and save  money for hardworking Americans. I commend Representative Angie Craig  and all of my colleagues for their work on this bill.   I urge all of my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying  bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H4025]]    I remind my friend from Minnesota who was talking about party-line  votes, we want to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, whether it  is insulin or across the board, which we have done in the Build Back  Better bill that is sitting in the Senate, and I can say I  think virtually every single Republican voted against negotiating  prescription drug prices.    If you want to talk about a free market, then you ought to be able to  negotiate prescription drug prices so that Americans across the board  get the best possible prices for their drugs.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Morelle), a prominent and distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, just a couple points in response.   One, we are trying to bring down the price of insulin--that is one of  the bills here that we are talking about--from the outrageous amounts  that are required for this lifesaving drug down to $35. Yet, my  Republican colleagues oppose reducing that.   They worry about inflation at the pump, which we all do, but it is  Putin's price hike. We know where this came from, this increase, and  the President is working to release millions of barrels of oil from our  underground storage, and he wants to place a price on leases that  aren't being used. We have 12 million acres that are under lease and  are not being used. That will bring down the price at the pump. But we  have to defeat Putin. It is his price hike.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the chairman of the Rules Committee.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, we are here about reducing prices on  insulin, something that so many Americans need. Yet, my colleagues want  to talk about a bill that is not even before the House of  Representatives today. We ought to be talking about reducing the price  of prescription drugs, like insulin, for Americans who need it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Scanlon), my friend, and another prominent member of the Committee  on Rules.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 90 seconds to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Green).    Mr. Speaker, could I inquire how much time each side  has remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I remind my friend, Mr. Arrington, that  there are 12 million acres of nonproducing Federal land with 9,000  unused but already approved permits for production.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to wish Mr. Arrington a happy  birthday.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I just remind my friend from Wisconsin  that 47 States, every territory, and the District of Columbia now allow  for some level of marijuana use, and this Congress is going to have to  catch up to what the States are doing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Pelosi).    Mr. Speaker, I ask my friend from Minnesota if she  has any other speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for joining me here today  to speak on the rule, the MORE Act, and the Affordable Insulin Now Act.  I especially want to thank Mr. Nadler, Ms. Lee, and Mr. Blumenauer with  respect to the MORE Act.   Data is clear that patients in the United States pay more than 10  times for their insulin than what patients in other countries pay for  this lifesaving drug. There are reports of people paying up to $1,000 a  month just to keep themselves alive. Nobody should face these kinds of  difficult decisions about affording their medication and keeping  themselves healthy or putting food on the table.   The Affordable Insulin Now Act puts a reasonable cap of $35 a month  on this important drug, and I hope we can advance this bipartisan idea  this week.                                time  1330    On marijuana, we are long past due for the reforms in the MORE Act.  The MORE Act is about justice, safety, equity, and States' rights. We  must decriminalize marijuana at the Federal level and take meaningful  steps to address the effects the war on drugs has had, particularly in  minority and disadvantaged communities.   To my friends on the other side of the aisle who claim this isn't an  important issue to American families, I encourage them to talk to  individuals who can't pass a background check to get a job, visit with  people who spent time in prison for a low-level marijuana conviction  whose lives have been changed forever, talk to a State-legal business  owner or employee who faces armed robberies or threats of violence due  to all the cash they have since the business can't access the banking  system.   The House is acting again this week to urge the Senate to finally  pass meaningful cannabis reform legislation. As this body knows, my  SAFE Banking Act has passed the House six times now without any Senate  action, with big bipartisan numbers. The House will pass the MORE Act  this week. It is clear Congress needs to reform our broken cannabis  laws to better respond to the 37 States across the country that have  some level of legal marijuana use.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Fischbach is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1017    At the end of the resolution, add the following:         Sec. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 6858) to strengthen United States energy security,       encourage domestic production of crude oil, petroleum       products, and natural gas, and for other purposes. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived. The       bill shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Energy and Commerce; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 6858.     Mr. Speaker, I encourage a ``yes'' vote on the rule  and the previous question.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.
