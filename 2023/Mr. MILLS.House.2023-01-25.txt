 Madam Speaker, today, I want to introduce myself not just  to the great people of Florida's Seventh District but to the rest of  America.   While I may not be in your district and your exact Representative, if  you believe in our constitutionality, if you believe in the rights,  liberties, and freedoms in which American exceptionalism once excelled  in, then I will be your Representative.                                time  1730    I came from a very humble upbringing. I grew up in a small town  called Auburndale, Florida, in central Florida.   My mother and father both suffered from drug and substance issues.  They were in and out of prison nearly all of my life--my father spent  nearly 30 years, my mother spent nearly 7 years. I bounced house to  house until I was finally adopted and taken in by my grandparents.   That is a very humbling experience for me, not just because so many  Americans today are suffering from these things, but to also understand  that I can hear your plight. Also, I understand the significant  importance of being a nuclear family member.   My grandparents didn't have much. My grandfather was a welder, my  grandmother used to do hair on the back patio for women in the  community. We lived on very little after my grandfather's disability.  But the one thing that we always had was our love, our faith, and this  Nation.   I went on to serve in the 82nd Airborne and as a member of the Joint  Special Operations Command, to serve honorably in our Armed Forces, and  to be a Bronze Star recipient.   My socioeconomic status and how I was born into what family did not  define who I am. That is something very rare in this world. That is  something that only exists here in America.   I have been honored and blessed to create tremendous businesses with  my wife, where we have gone on to serve over 200 of our law enforcement  departments: SRT, HRT, the FDLE, the Department of Corrections, as well  as for our members of the Armed Forces. In my family, we truly believe  in the ideas of defend, not defund our men and women in blue, and that  matters to us.   I would just add that as I stand here, willing to serve yet again in  a new uniform, I want you to know that accountability, transparency,  and accessibility to your Members should be a top priority. That also  means accountability for the wrongdoings of our Federal Government,  whether it is the overstepping of State's rights and individual rights  and the violations of the 10th amendment, or whether it is getting  accountability for the wrongdoings of open borders, a failed Afghan  withdrawal, and the America-last policies that have threatened our  energy independence.   Madam Speaker, I know something about these failed withdrawals. When  Congressman Ronny Jackson from Texas reached out to me, he had a  mother, Miriam, with three children, a 15-year-old boy, an 11-year-old  little girl, and a 2-year-old little girl. They were left behind in  Afghanistan after the Biden administration chose to abandon Bagram Air  Base to hand over to the Chinese, that enabled over 40,000 Taliban,  Haqqani, and ISIS Khorasan to be released from their detention centers,  but it also shut down the commercial flights that many Americans had  planned on using to return home.   This mother and her three children only wanted to do one thing,  return back home to America. When Ronny Jackson called the Department  of Defense and the Department of State under this Biden administration,  they failed to answer the call.   That is why when he called me, we put together a great team that went  over, and after 11 days and three failed attempts, the Biden  administration not only threatened to shoot down an aircraft of  Americans, which was a November aircraft that was there to save other  Americans, but he thwarted us in three other efforts.   The great thing about America is that we are not defined by the  minority, which is our Federal Government. We are defined by the voice  of the American people, which is the majority that cannot be silenced.  That is why  [[Page H319]]  after 11 days, multiple attempts, and crossing into impermissible  environments, we were able to rescue and conduct the very first  successful overland rescue of Americans out of Afghanistan and return  that mother and her three children back and they finished out their  school year.   Madam Speaker, the one thing I believe in is action. While I take  this time to speak before you today, I want you to know that that is  not what the American people are about--politicians speaking, but  acting.   When it came to the 2020 riots, we didn't sit back and ask to defend  and dismantle our law enforcement. My wife and I, we stood strong as we  donated hundreds of thousands of dollars and less lethal goods to  defend our law enforcement, our communities, their businesses, and  their homes.   If I have learned nothing in my time in the military as a combat  veteran, as a businessowner, as a foreign policy expert, and as an  American, it is that it is time for action.
