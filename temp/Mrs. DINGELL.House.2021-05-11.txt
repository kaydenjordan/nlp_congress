 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for being a very  good and fair chairman.   I rise in support of the Block, Report, And Suspend Suspicious  Shipments Act. This bipartisan legislation would implement safeguards  against pill dumping and other abusive practices to address the ongoing  opioid epidemic, which remains one of the most pressing public health  threats facing our country.   Last year, over 88,000 Americans lost their lives as a result of the  opioid crisis, including 2,650 individuals in my home State of  Michigan. Communities across the country are hurting, and new tools to  address pill dumping and other dodgy practices that have exacerbated  the opioid crisis are needed now more than ever.   The Block, Report, And Suspend Suspicious Shipments Act will  strengthen oversight and integrity of the opioid supply chain by  requiring that drug manufacturers and distributors exercise due  diligence when they receive a suspicious order for controlled  substances. This includes blocking or declining to fill the suspicious  order and providing DEA additional data and background on the  indicators of the order in question.   This legislation's commonsense protection will save lives in Michigan  and all around this country by making distributors and manufacturers  active partners in curbing these abuses.   I would like to recognize my colleague, Congressman McKinley, for his  record of leadership, concern, empathy, compassion, and working to  address this longstanding issue that has helped perpetuate the opioid  crisis.   I would also like to thank Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member  Rodgers, as well as the Democratic and Republican committee staff, for  their hard work to build consensus and advance this important  bipartisan priority.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
