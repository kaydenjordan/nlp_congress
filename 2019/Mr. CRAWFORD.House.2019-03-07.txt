 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend my alma mater,  Arkansas State University, for hosting the 25th Annual College of  Agriculture Agribusiness Conference. This conference focuses on farm  management, commodity and credit markets, and the economics and  politics of trade and farm policy.   During this conference, Chancellor Damphousse announced a $1 million  gift for the College of Agriculture from the Judd Hill Foundation.   Farmers and those involved in the agriculture industry throughout  Arkansas attend this meeting each year to learn about important  deadlines and challenges that producers will encounter this growing  season from a diverse group of speakers. This year, speakers included  Tyne Morgan, host of U.S. Farm Report, as well as two of my past  interns, Hunter Biram and Grant Wilson.   Instrumental to this conference's continued success has been Dr.  Greenwalt, conference director and cofounder. Dr. Greenwalt, professor  of agricultural economics at Arkansas State, also serves as a director  of the Arkansas Agricultural Council. I had the pleasure of being one  of Dr. Greenwalt's students while pursuing my degree in agricultural  business at Arkansas State University.   Many others come to support this annual event. As the event grows, so  does the attendance.   I would like to extend my congratulations and gratitude to Dr.  Greenwalt, Dean Burcham, and everyone who contributed to the success of  the ASU Agribusiness Conference for the last 25 years.                            ____________________
