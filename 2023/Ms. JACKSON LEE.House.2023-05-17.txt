 Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished ranking  member, and I thank the manager on the other side for their work.   This is National Police Week. I started my week in joining a family  from Houston whose husband and father had fallen as a police officer in  the line of duty, but it was also with the throngs of men and women of  law enforcement across America and families at the 42nd Annual National  Memory Day for law enforcement officers.   I spent quite a bit of time there, interacting with officers that  were not only from Texas or Houston. I respect the service that they  have given as we, as Members of Congress and Democrats and my friends  on the other side of the aisle, should do.                                time  1330    And as we interacted, the response was an appreciation, as I  expressed, an appreciation for their service.   We have done a number of bills on the floor, and I am glad that we  had one that honored that day. I proudly managed that bill, as well as  a number of others that were on previously.   There are a number of bills that have been on the floor or are on the  floor today, at least two. Before I speak of the underlying bill, let  me acknowledge my support for H.R. 3091, the Federal Law Enforcement  Officer Service Weapon Purchase Act, which has previously been debated.  I would say that this deals with Federal law enforcement officers in  good standing.   It is a smart way to deal with guns that have been retired. That will  allow--rather than creating dust in the GSA, and as well, who knows,  them falling in the wrong hands for whatever reason, you might say-- rather than destroying those guns, it would allow Federal agencies to  sell the handguns used in the performance of their duties to Federal  law enforcement officers in good standing, promoting public safety,  reducing waste, and recouping taxpayer dollars.   This is good legislation. I hope as it makes its way that they will  add some form of a check--which all officers believe in background  checks. Maybe they will take those resources and invest in bringing  down gun violence, which we know, as of this week, two law enforcement  officers were injured in New Mexico, as a young, underage teenager had  an AR-15 and killed three innocent civilians.   Mr. Chair, it would be nice if the legislation would use those  resources to help bring down gun violence. H.R. 3091 is a good bill,  and I intend to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3091, the Federal Law  Enforcement Officer Service Weapon Purchase Act (in its current form).   When a federal agency has property it no longer needs, such as  firearms, the property is declared excess and is reported to GSA to be  screened for possible transfer to other Federal agencies with a need  for such property.   If no other agencies request the excess property, it is declared  surplus--and in the case of firearms, required to be destroyed.   Rather than destroying retired, surplus handguns, H.R. 3091 would  allow federal agencies to sell the handguns used in the performance of  their duties to federal law enforcement officers in good standing-- promoting public safety, reducing waste, and recouping taxpayer funds.   Although I support this legislation, I should point out that the  previous version--introduced last Congress by my Democratic colleague-- included a requirement that any law enforcement officer making a  purchase must pass a background check as part of the transfer. But this  version does not.   The previous version also wisely advised via a sense of Congress that  proceeds from the sale of these handguns should be used to fund  evidence-based gun violence prevention or gun safety programs.   While we might assume that no problems could arise in the sale of a  handgun to an officer in good standing, a background check or records  check of some kind would ensure that vital information about that  officer has not been missed, overlooked, or fallen through a gap in  reporting.   That is why I support the Jacobs' amendment that would further define  the good standing requirement--ensuring that only responsible, law- abiding officers can purchase these firearms.   However, because we too must be responsible, especially when it comes  to setting policy for buying, selling, and trading firearms, I cannot  support this bill if the Republican poison pills are adopted.   This trio of amendments would destroy each of the foundational  purposes of the bill that brought Republican and Democratic members of  the House Judiciary Committee together during the markup of this bill-- promoting public safety, reducing waste, and recouping taxpayer funds.   Together, these amendments would allow, not just handguns but  military-grade weapons that have no business in civilian homes and  communities, to be provided at little to no cost, to retired officers,  without any means to determine their suitably for taking possession of  these weapons.   I am disappointed that we could lose the opportunity to pass this  thoughtful legislation during National Police Week by attaching these  reckless amendments.   That is why I implore my colleagues to vote No to the Luttrell,  McCormick, and Rosendale amendments.   And I encourage members on both sides of the aisle to support H.R.  3091 and the Jacobs Amendment.    Mr. Chair, we are now at a time when we are talking  about H.R. 2494. I would say that when interacting with law enforcement  officers, I have never heard one person raise this. I don't think we  can condemn prosecutors across America that they are not willing to  stand up and be counted when any assault occurs against an officer.   Any such legitimate assault should be both an arrest and prosecution.  That is not what we are saying. If it happens to be an LPR or green  card holder or whatever status the person has--arrested and prosecuted.   What we are saying is desperate people come to this country and they  work hard to get a status, and if it is legitimate, they wind up in  jail. That is where they can be. H.R. 2494 ignores that.   One, it is not one that you have heard any officers asking for. Two,  that person can be convicted and wind up in jail. I know there is an  amendment to say if they are convicted that would be the case.  Ordinarily, they would be able to serve their time. I don't think that  we should use this hammer to tear families apart.    Mr. Chair, this bill has been ill-drafted in harmful  measure and does not seek to address a need that people are crying for.   The bill insults prosecutors across America. You can't label them  all. In essence, it insults law enforcement officers, who themselves  know that somebody who is in distress might respond accordingly. It  insults the long time it takes to become a citizen of the United  States, and some of these individuals have been waiting and waiting and  maybe had an unfortunate circumstance. We are talking about some of the  incidents that Ranking Member Nadler cited. It is just unruly.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to consider thoughtfully that we are  doing good in a bipartisan way. Let us continue to do that. Police like  to see that. They like to see themselves being affirmed in a bipartisan  manner. They don't like to see other people being scapegoats.   Mr. Chair, we want them to be safe. We don't want violence. We don't  want them to be injured. That is the statement we all should make.  Let's find laws that will ensure that that will not happen.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2494, the Protect Our Law  Enforcement with Immigration Control and Enforcement (POLICE) Act.   This bill is an incredibly ill drafted and harmful measure that does  not seek to address illegal immigration or support for law  enforcement--rather it creates punitive deportation penalties to remove  individuals who are lawfully here--cruelly scaling back on legal  immigration pathways rather than increasing them.   This bill is a solution in search of a problem--essentially seeking  to expand the scope of people who can be deported.   It is so broadly drafted that people who pose no real danger to law  enforcement could be subject to deportation.  [[Page H2398]]    Let's be clear, this is not about undocumented immigrants who are  already removable. This is about people who have come lawfully and been  admitted to the United States.   We are talking about lawful permanent residents. People who have set  down roots and established themselves here in the United States.   Given that my Republican colleagues have been unwilling to add a  conviction requirement or a requirement that the offense included the  intention to cause harm or use violence, I had hoped they would have  been willing to accept an amendment that allows an immigration judge or  Department of Homeland Security adjudicator to look at variety of  mitigating factors when assessing if someone should be deemed  deportable.   During the Judiciary Committee markup and the Rules Committee  hearing, offered in the Rules Committee would have allowed for  mitigating factors to be taken into account before someone is deported  as a result of an assault on a law enforcement officer.   However, my Democratic colleagues and I could not get any Republican  to roll back their punitive and damaging intent to harm any and all  individuals seeking refuge and citizenship here in the U.S.--no matter  the vulnerability of their circumstances.   As has already been discussed, this bill is attempting to add a new  avenue to deport people with green cards.   If we are going to deport these people, it should be for a serious  offense and there needs to be serious consideration of the  circumstances pertaining to the alleged offense.   People who are convicted of serious assaults on law enforcement  officers are already deportable.   Under current immigration law, if an individual is convicted of a  crime of violence and sentenced to a year or more in prison, that is an  aggravated felony and that person is deportable.   The same is true for someone who is convicted of a ``crime involving  moral turpitude,'' where the crime is punishable by imprisonment of one  year or more.   Both of these deportability grounds are currently invoked when there  is a conviction for a serious, intentional assault on a law enforcement  officer, where bodily injury occurs or is intended.   This amendment would have allow the official making the final  determination on deportation the ability to examine additional  mitigating factors as evidence weighing against deportation.   The official would be able to take into account:   if there was intent to harm;   the severity of offense;   if the act resulted in harm;   the individual's military service (if any);   how long the individual has been in the United States; and   the individual's ties to the community.   These factors are vitally important for an immigration judge or other  adjudicator to consider in order to ensure that we do not end up with  some of the absurd results which have already been outlined today by my  colleagues.   We should not be deporting long-term green card holders for minor  offenses. Just as a reminder, these examples include:   A green card holder in a fire who pushes a firefighter out of the way  of a falling beam. This person would have committed assault and become  deportable.   Likewise, if a foreign student whose religion prohibits blood  transfusions is receiving medical care from an Emergency Medical  Technician (EMT) and she swats the EMT's hand away because she is  trying to give him a blood transfusion, that student will have  committed assault on a law enforcement officer and become deportable  under this bill.   As another example, if a green card holder sees a fight on the street  and attempts to intervene by getting between the individuals and  pushing them apart. If one of the individuals was an undercover police  officer performing his duties, the individual would have committed  assault under this bill and become deportable.   In all of these examples, one would hope the individuals would never  be charged, let alone convicted of a crime.   However, even without a conviction or intent to harm requirement, by  admitting to actions that constitute assault, any of those individuals  would have admitted to intentionally assaulting a law enforcement  officer and would become deportable under this bill.   We should not be deporting green card holders for such minor  offenses.   If the majority insists on doing so, they should at least allow  adjudicators to look at mitigating factors to ensure that we are  preventing good members of our society from getting swept up in this  overbroad bill.   Let me just say that it is truly unfortunate that the Rules Committee  did not consider my amendment or that of my colleagues.   We need to stop putting forth harmful and unproductive legislation  and work on passing legislation that truly addresses meaningful  immigration reform.
