 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with excitement to  congratulate the Las Vegas Aces for winning the 2022 WNBA finals.   The Las Vegas Aces are the first Las Vegas-based team to bring home a  professional sports championship. Before winning the championship, this  team was built for success, having the best regular season record this  year.   Forward A'ja Wilson was named the WNBA Most Valuable Player for the  second time in her career, and during the semifinals, point guard  Chelsea Gray became the first player in WNBA history with more than 30  points and 10 assists in a playoff game.   In her first year as head coach, Becky Hammon led this championship  team with determination and poise.

Go Aces.                            ____________________
