 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the  rededication of Patriots and Heroes Park in Lancaster, New York, and  the many men and women who devoted their lives in service to our  community.   Mr. Russell J. Salvatore founded and funded this memorial as a place  for patriotism and peaceful reflection of the imagery honoring  veterans, members of law enforcement, first responders, and the heroes  that have dedicated their lives to the safety of others.   These monuments were vandalized heartlessly and defaced in March, and  the images of the destruction shocked our community.   Now, fully restored, thanks to the work and support and funding of  Mr. Russell J. Salvatore, our community is gathering once again at  Patriots and Heroes Park today to honor those who served and sacrificed  for this great Nation.   I thank the veterans, police officers, and first responders for their  valor, courage, and service to their fellow Americans.   Mr. Salvatore has been a titan of Buffalo, and I know the people of  the 23rd Congressional District are grateful for his generosity over  the many years. I congratulate Mr. Salvatore on his many years of  success and on the rededication of Patriots and Heroes Park.   Our community has chosen to turn this act of hatred into a new  monument to thank our heroes and celebrate our patriotism as Americans.  I am honored to join the celebration from the Halls of Congress.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, five counties in my district have  declared a state of emergency in response to the influx of migrants  since title 42 ended. These five counties didn't declare a state of  emergency out of hate or a lack of compassion but because they simply  do not have the resources to handle the unprecedented flood of illegal  immigration.    Our local taxpayers and tax dollars meant to support our kids in  schools across Chautauqua, Cattaraugus, and Allegheny Counties are  instead going to house illegal immigrants, thanks to a crisis that the  Biden administration created.   My colleagues across the aisle have claimed time and again that by  opposing an unprecedented influx of illegal immigration, Republicans  somehow lack compassion or humanity. Mr. Speaker, allowing fentanyl to  flood in from our southern border, killing thousands of Americans, and  offering no concrete solutions to combat this epidemic is not  compassionate. Standing back and demonizing our Border Patrol agents  while the cartels traffic countless human beings, including young  children, into this country is not compassionate. The Department of  Health and Human Services losing track of 85,000 migrant children, with  an untold number trafficked and exploited, is not compassionate,  either.   Foisting this inhumane crisis onto the backs of small-town America  after the richest, most liberal enclaves in our country, like Martha's  Vineyard, clutch their pearls at even the sight of one group of illegal  immigrants is not compassionate.   I am proud to cosponsor H. Res. 461 to be considered under this rule,  and I look forward to this and many more steps Republicans in the House  are taking to secure our border and to force this administration to  uphold our immigration laws.    Mr. Speaker, in this body we are privileged to serve  our districts and do right by the American people. We have been  entrusted with a tremendous responsibility that shapes the future of  our Nation.   First and foremost, we must remember that we are not here to serve  our own interests or pursue personal agendas.   Unfortunately, one of the most powerful members of the Democratic  Caucus, Adam Schiff, abused his role and violated the trust of the  American people. As chairman of the House Intelligence Committee,  Schiff initiated an unfounded investigation into the leftist lies  around Russian collusion.   This investigation was predicated on nothing more than political  propaganda. The Durham report clearly shows that the Russia hoax was  manufactured by the left to divide our Nation and discredit and derail  President Trump's agenda.   He not only wasted countless hours of committee work, but he also  wasted nearly $32 million in taxpayer dollars.   Schiff repeatedly used the authority he was afforded in his position  as chairman to lie to the American people to support his political  agenda. Even after the Durham report discredited the Russia hoax, he  continued to knowingly lie and peddle this false narrative.   These actions leave a real and lasting stain on this institution. We  cannot allow Representative Schiff to continue to serve in this body  with no consequences for the abuse of his power.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and to  send a clear message to the American people that we will hold Members  of Congress accountable.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey  for yielding me the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 461, condemning the use of  elementary and secondary school facilities to provide shelter for  illegal immigrants.   Under the policies of the Biden administration, every State is a  border State. The communities across my district are feeling this  burden.   Five counties in my district declared a state of emergency because  they simply do not have the resources to handle the flood of illegal  immigration that this administration has allowed unchecked.   This crisis is exacerbated by the radical sanctuary city policies of  New York Democrats. They have turned their back on hardworking  Americans, forcing small towns to manage illegal immigrants that  overflow out of these Democrat-run cities. Now they want to take  resources away from our students.   By turning taxpayer-funded schools into housing, we steal critical  resources from student achievement, impede the learning process, and  jeopardize the safety of our schools.   Let me be clear: the radical open border policies of Democrats in  Washington, Albany, and New York City have created these problems. It  is our duty to protect our borders, secure our schools, and uphold the  rights and the safety of our children.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be cosponsor of H. Res. 461, and I urge my  colleagues to support this measure and join us in our commitment to  securing our borders and enforcing our immigration laws. Together, we  can put an end to this crisis and ensure the well-being of our  communities and the future of our Nation.
