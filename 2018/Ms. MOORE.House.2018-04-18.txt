 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to proudly represent all of the  welfare queens in the United States of America, all those women who get  up every day and struggle as mothers, often caretakers for elderly  parents, who are juggling two and three minimum wage jobs, $7.25-an- hour jobs a day, and then being told that they are welfare cheats  because they need food stamps, SNAP, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program, in order to meet the basic food needs of their children.   I rise, Mr. Speaker, to decry your, Mr. Speaker, agenda and the  agenda of the majority party to beat up on these poor, hard-working  people because they are poor, people who find themselves in the  predicament of having more month than money and need just a little bit  of assistance to meet those basic nutritional needs.   We are sick and tired of people exaggerating and claiming that people  are  [[Page H3402]]  gaming the system to the tune of $65,000, $70,000 a year, and that they  don't want to work. People want to work, but they are constantly in  competition with foreign workers who earn $3 a day. We are in a  postindustrial economy, and often people cannot find work and cannot  find enough work to meet their needs.   Often people find work, but those jobs do not provide them, Mr.  Speaker, with healthcare. But they are being told that they need to  provide a urine specimen and have a drug test to get healthcare simply  because they don't have an employer that is able to provide them or  willing to provide them with healthcare.   Although the claims, Mr. Speaker, have been refuted time and again  with facts and research that poor people have dignity, poor people love  their children, but poor people are just not getting a fair shot  despite all of this.   Republicans continue to perpetuate this propaganda and these talking  points that impose even more obstacles on people who are poor. They  continue to promote policies that are humiliating, like the ration or  harvest boxes or peeing in a cup and eliminating basic rights of  Americans because they are financially poor in the richest country on  the planet. We are sick and tired, Mr. Speaker, of being sick and  tired.                                time  1030    And why do we think this is happening, Mr. Speaker? We think this is  happening, Mr. Speaker, because you yourself, Mr. Speaker, declared  that we are going to pay for the $1.5 trillion tax cut that we just  gave to the wealthiest Americans, corporations, shareholders, all over  this planet, we are going to pay for them by cutting Medicaid. We are  going to pay for them, Mr. Speaker, by cutting Medicare. We are going  to pay for them by cutting Social Security. We are going to pay for  them by cutting food stamps, thus the need to vilify people who are  poor.   Mr. Speaker, how about if we really want to help people escape  poverty and reduce dependency on the safety net, how about trying to  raise the minimum wage so that people who are having trouble putting  food on the table will actually earn enough money to be able to afford  to pay for basic food needs?   If we really want to help people escape poverty, why don't we  recognize that basic healthcare is a human right? And we should be  trying to fortify the Affordable Care Act as opposed to 60, 70 attempts  to repeal it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Americans to wake up.                            ____________________
