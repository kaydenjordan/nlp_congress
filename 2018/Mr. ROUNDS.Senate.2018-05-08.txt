 Mr. President, today I recognize Kellie Morford,  an intern in my Washington, DC, office, for all the hard work she has  done on behalf of myself, my staff, and the State of South Dakota.   Kellie is a graduate of Spearfish High School in Spearfish, SD.  Recently, she graduated from Chadron State College in Chadron, NE,  where she studied criminal justice and legal studies. Kellie is a  dedicated and diligent worker who has been devoted to getting the most  out of her internship experience and who has been a true asset to the  office.   I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Kellie for all of the  fine work she has done and wish her continued success in the years to  come.                            ____________________
