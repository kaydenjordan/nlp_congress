 Mr. Speaker, after 72 years on the air, Carl Lamm, whom  many know as the voice of Johnston County, retired as America's longest  continuous radio broadcaster on Friday, March 29.   Mr. Carl, as many of us affectionately call him, has been co-owner  and operator of WTSB-AM radio in Smithfield, North Carolina, since  1958. His daily programming was revered by millions throughout the  State, Nation, and world who listened to him on the radio and online  throughout the course of his career.   In more than seven decades on air, he brought some of the greatest  musicians, top athletes, professionals of all stripes, and national  political figures and commentators into the homes and businesses of his  listeners to discuss current events and politics, to preach the Word of  God, and much more.   He has witnessed the evolution of radio from the glory days of the  Grand Ole Opry to the digital age of the 21st century.   Mr. Carl's many notable recognitions include North Carolina's highest  civilian honor, The Order of the Long Leaf Pine, as well as membership  in the North Carolina Broadcasters Hall of Fame. However, what I admire  most is his loyal faith in our creator.   Suffice it to say, we will all miss listening to Mr. Carl on the air  at WTSB radio. It is not often that you get to know a legend in their  own time. Mr. Carl is just that and a very dear friend to many as well.   As he enters this new chapter of life known as retirement, may God  always continue to bless his path.                            ____________________
