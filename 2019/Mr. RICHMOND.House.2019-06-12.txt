 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, first, let me start off by including in  the Record a Harvard Public Health journal article, ``America Is  Failing Its Black Mothers.''                    America Is Failing Its Black Mothers         For decades, Harvard Chan alumni have shed light on high       maternal mortality rates in African American women. Finally,       policymakers are beginning to pay attention.        Serena Williams knew her body well enough to listen when it       told her something was wrong. Winner of 23 Grand Slam singles       titles, she'd been playing tennis since age 3--as a       professional since 14. Along the way, she'd survived a life-      threatening blood clot in her lungs, bounced back from knee       injuries, and drowned out the voices of sports commentators       and fans who criticized her body and spewed racist epithets.       At 36, Williams was as powerful as ever. She could still       devastate opponents with the power of a serve once clocked at       128.6 miles per hour. But in September 2017, on the day after       delivering her baby, Olympia, by emergency C-section,       Williams lost her breath and recognized the warning signs of       a serious condition.        She walked out of her hospital room and approached a nurse,       Williams later told Vogue magazine. Gasping out her words,       she said that she feared another blood clot and needed a CT       scan and an IV of heparin, a blood thinner. The nurse       suggested that Williams' pain medication must be making her       confused. Williams insisted that something was wrong, and a       test was ordered--an ultrasound on her legs to address       swelling. When that turned up nothing, she was finally sent       for the lung CT. It found several blood clots. And, just as       Williams had suggested, heparin did the trick. She told       Vogue, ``I was like, listen to Dr. Williams!''        But her ordeal wasn't over. Severe coughing had opened her       C-section incision, and a subsequent surgery revealed a       hemorrhage at that site. When Williams was finally released       from the hospital, she was confined to her bed for six weeks.        Wanda Irving holds her granddaughter, Soleil, in front of a       portrait of Soleil's mother, Shalon Irving, at home in Sandy       Springs, Georgia. Wanda has been raising Soleil since       Shalon--an epidemiologist with the U.S. Centers for Disease       Control and Prevention--died in 2017 from complications of       hypertension a few weeks after giving birth.        Like Williams, Shalon Irving, an African American woman,       was 36 when she had her baby in 2017. An epidemiologist at       the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),       she wrote in her Twitter bio, ``I see inequity wherever it       exists, call it by name, and work to eliminate it.''        Irving knew her pregnancy was risky. She had a clotting       disorder and a history of high blood pressure, but she also       had access to top-quality care and a strong support system of       family and friends. She was doing so well after the C-section       birth of her baby, Soleil, that her doctors consented to her       request to leave the hospital after just two nights (three or       four is typical). But after she returned home, things quickly       went downhill.        For the next three weeks, Irving made visit after visit to       her primary care providers, first for a painful hematoma       (blood trapped under layers of healing skin) at her incision,       then for spiking blood pressure, headaches and blurred       vision, swelling legs, and rapid weight gain. Her mother told       ProPublica that at these appointments, clinicians repeatedly       assured Irving that the symptoms were normal. She just needed       to wait it out. But hours after her last medical appointment,       Irving took a newly prescribed blood pressure medication,       collapsed, and died soon after at the hospital when her       family removed her from life support.        Viewed up close, the deaths of mothers like Irving are       devastating, private tragedies. But pull back, and a picture       emerges of a public health crisis that's been hiding in plain       sight for the last 30 years.        Following decades of decline, maternal deaths began to rise       in the United States around 1990--a significant departure       from the world's other affluent countries. By 2013, rates had       more than doubled. The CDC now estimates that 700 to 900 new       and expectant mothers die in the U.S. each year, and an       additional 500,000 women experience life-threatening       postpartum complications. More than half of these deaths and       near deaths are from preventable causes, and a       disproportionate number of the women suffering are black.        Put simply, for black women far more than for white women,       giving birth can amount to a death sentence. African American       women are three to four times more likely to die during or       after delivery than are white women. According to the World       Health Organization, their odds of surviving childbirth are       comparable to those of women in countries such as Mexico and       Uzbekistan, where significant proportions of the population       live in poverty.        Irving's friend Raegan McDonald-Mosley, chief medical       director for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, told       ProPublica, ``You can't educate your way out of this problem.       You can't health-care-access your way out of this problem.       There's something inherently wrong with the system that's not       valuing the lives of black women equally to white women.''                                 Lost mothers         Speaking at a symposium hosted by the Maternal Health Task       Force at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in       September 2018, investigative reporter Nina Martin noted       telling commonalities in the stories she's gathered about       mothers who died. Once a baby is born, he or she becomes the       focus of medical attention. Mothers are monitored less, their       concerns are often dismissed, and they tend to be sent home       without adequate information about potentially concerning       symptoms. For African American mothers, the risks jump at       each stage of the labor, delivery, and postpartum process.        Neel Shah, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Beth Israel       Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and director of the       Delivery Decisions Initiative at Ariadne Labs, recalls being       struck by Martin's ProPublica-NPR series Lost Mothers, which       delved into the issue. ``The common thread is that when black       women expressed concern about their symptoms, clinicians were       more delayed and seemed to believe them less,'' he says.       ``It's forced me to think more deeply about my own approach.       There is a very fine line between clinical intuition and       unconscious bias.''        For members of the public, the experiences of prominent       black women may prove to be a teachable moment. When pop       superstar Beyonce developed the hypertensive disorder pre-      eclampsia--which left untreated can kill a mother and her       baby--after delivering her twins by emergency C-section in       2017, Google searches related to the condition spiked.       According to the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and       Quality, pre-eclampsia--one of the leading causes of maternal       death--and eclampsia (seizures that develop after pre-      eclampsia) are 60 percent more common in African American       women than in white women, and also more severe. If it can       happen to Beyonce--an international star who presumably can       afford the highest-quality medical care--it can happen to       anyone.                              Weathering report         Arline Geronimus, SD '85, has been talking about the       effects of racism on health for decades, even when others       haven't wanted to listen. Growing up in the 1960s in       Brookline, Massachusetts, Geronimus, who is white, absorbed       the messages of the Civil Rights movement and the       harrowing stories of her Jewish family's experiences in       czarist Russia. When she headed off to Princeton as an       undergraduate, she resolved to find a way to fight against       injustice. Her initial plan to become a civil rights       lawyer gave way when  [[Page H4576]]       she discovered the power and potential of public health       research.        Geronimus worked as a research assistant for a professor       studying teen pregnancy among poor urban residents, and, as a       volunteer at a Planned Parenthood clinic, witnessed close-up       the lives of pregnant black teens living in poverty in       Trenton, New Jersey. She felt a chasm open up between what       some of her white male professors were confidently       explicating about the lives of these adolescents and how the       young women themselves saw their lives.        According to the conventional wisdom at the time, Geronimus       says, teen pregnancy was the primary driver of maternal and       infant deaths and a host of multigenerational health and       social problems among low-income African Americans.       Researchers focused on this issue while ignoring broader       systemic factors.        Geronimus sought to connect the dots between the health       problems the girls experienced, like asthma and type 2       diabetes, and negative forces in their lives. She visited       them in their crumbling apartments and accompanied them to       medical appointments where doctors treated the girls like       props, without agency in their own care. And she noticed that       they seemed older, somehow, than girls the same age whom       Geronimus knew.        ``That's when I got the fire in my belly,'' she says, her       voice rising. ``These young women had real, immediate needs       that those of us in the hallowed halls of Princeton could       have helped address. But we weren't seeing those urgent       needs. We just wanted to teach them about contraception.''        Geronimus came to the Harvard Chan School to learn how to       rigorously explore the ways that social disadvantage corrodes       health--a concept for which she coined the term       ``weathering.'' Her adviser, Steven Gortrnaker, professor of       the practice of health sociology, provided data for her to       correlate infant mortality by maternal age. While most such       studies put mothers into broad categories of teen and not-      teen, Geronimus looked at the risks they faced at every age.       The results were surprising even to her.        White women in their 20s were more likely to give birth to       a healthy baby than those in their teens. But among black       women, the opposite was true: The older the mother, the       greater the risk of maternal and newborn health complications       and death. In public health, the condition of a baby is       considered a reliable proxy for the health of the mother.       Geronimus' data suggested that black women may be less       healthy at 25 than at 17.        ``Being able to see those stark numbers was essential for       me,'' says Geronimus, who is now a professor of health       behavior and health education at the University of Michigan       School of Public Health and a member of the National Academy       of Medicine. And the implications were staggering. If young       black women were already showing signs of weathering, how       would that play out over the rest of their lives--and what       could be done to stop it?        Geronimus' questions were ahead of their time. The press       and the public--even other scientists--misinterpreted her       findings as a recommendation that black women have children       in their teens, she says, recalling with a sigh such clueless       headlines as, ``Researcher says let them have babies.''        In the 1970s, even researchers who broached the topic of       racial differences in health outcomes--and few did--focused       on small pieces of the puzzle. Some were looking at genetics,       others at behavioral and cultural differences or health care       access. ``No one wanted to look at what was wrong with how       our society works and how that can be expressed in the health       of different groups,'' Geronimus says. Over time, her ideas       would become harder to dismiss.        The tide began to turn in the early 1980s, when former       Health and Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler convened       the first group of experts to conduct a comprehensive study       of the health status of minority populations. As the field of       social epidemiology took off, the Report of the Secretary's       Task Force on Black and Minority Health (also known as the       Heckler Report) brought Geronimus' animating questions into       mainstream debate.        Then, in 1993, researchers identified a physiological       mechanism that could finally explain weathering: allostatic       load. ``We as a species are designed to respond to threats to       life by having a physiological stress response,'' Geronimus       explains. ``When you face a literal life-or-death threat,       there is a short window of time during which you must escape       or be killed by the predator.'' Stress hormones cascade       through the body, sending blood flowing to the muscles and       the heart to help the body run faster and fight harder.       Molecules called pro-inflammatory cytokines are produced to       help heal any wounds that result.        These processes siphon energy from other bodily systems       that aren't enlisted in the fight-or-flight response,       including those that support healthy pregnancies. That's not       important if the threat is short term, because the body's       biochemical homeostasis quickly returns to normal. But for       people who face chronic threats and hardships--like       struggling to make ends meet on a minimum wage job or       witnessing racialized police brutality--the fight-or-flight       response may never abate. ``It's like facing tigers coming       from several directions every day,'' Geronimus says, and the       damage is compounded over time.        As a result, health risks rise at increasingly younger ages       for chronic conditions like hypertension and type 2 diabetes.       Depression and sleep deprivation become more common. People       are also more likely to engage in risky coping behaviors,       such as overeating, drinking, and smoking.        Geronimus' foundational work in the 1980s and 1990s has       been cited by David R. Williams, the Florence Sprague Norman       and Laura Smart Norman Professor of Public Health at the       Harvard Chan School, an internationally recognized expert in       the ways that racism and other social influences affect       health. His Everyday Discrimination Scale is one of the most       widely used measures of discrimination in health studies. It       includes questions that measure experiences such as being       treated with discourtesy, receiving poorer service than       others in restaurants or stores, or witnessing people act as       if they're afraid of you. As he explained in a 2016 TED MED       talk, ``This scale captures ways in which the dignity and the       respect of people who society does not value is chipped away       on a daily basis.''           Maternal Mortality in the U.S.: A Human Rights Crisis         Despite high-tech medical advances of the last century,       women around the world are still dying in pregnancy and       childbirth from age-old scourges such as hemorrhage and pre-      eclampsia and, increasingly, from complications related to       chronic diseases, obesity, and advanced maternal age.        In 2000, the global health and development community       acknowledged the need for action in Goal 5 of the U.N.       Millennium Development Goals, which aimed to reduce maternal       deaths by three-quarters in 15 years (it declined by 45       percent). While press and publicity around the push offered       harrowing stories, women reading these stories in the U.S.       may well have come away believing that it was a problem for       mothers in villages in Sierra Leone--but surely not in       Atlanta or Washington, D.C.        Starting in 2008, human rights groups around the world       began calling on the U.S. to do more to keep its mothers from       dying. The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of       Racial Discrimination (CERD) expressed concern about       inequities in maternal mortality and recommended that steps       be taken to improve access to maternal health care, family       planning, and sexuality education and information.        A 2012 Amnesty International report declared that these       steps weren't enough: ``Preventable maternal mortality can       result from or reflect violations of a variety of human       rights, including the right to life, the right to freedom       from discrimination, and the right to the highest attainable       standard of health.'' Having ratified two key international       treaties guaranteeing these rights, the authors wrote, the       U.S. government should be held accountable.        Four years later, representatives from the advocacy       organization SisterSong, the Center for Reproductive Rights,       and National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health issued       a report to CERD further exploring these issues. CERD adopted       the groups' recommendations, including addressing stereotypes       that promote discrimination in clinical settings and       standardizing data collection on maternal deaths. In 2015, an       advocacy organization called Black Mamas Matter emerged out       of this effort to keep pushing the agenda forward.        To the women leading the charge, one central fact was       clear: Racism is an undeniable thread running through the       stories of black mothers who die. But as Elizabeth Dawes Gay,       co-director of Black Mamas Matter and a public health       professional, wrote in The Nation, providers and researchers       often place ``the onus for large-scale change on individuals       rather than the systems that we know cause harm.''     Madam Chair, I rise today with an amendment to increase  funding for the State Maternal Health Innovation Program by $7 million.  This program is specifically tasked with reducing care gaps, maternal  mortality, and disparities in maternal health.   The United States is the greatest country in the world with the most  innovative healthcare system around. We continue to develop cutting- edge treatments that stretch the bounds of what is possible. Within the  last two decades, we have mapped the human genome, conducted surgeries  over the Internet, and grown organs out of stem cells. We have cured  diseases and revolutionized treatments.   Despite all that progress, more of our mothers and mothers-to-be are  dying today than at the turn of the century. Somehow, we have seen our  maternal mortality rate increase over the past 25 years, and  preventable near-deaths related to pregnancy have increased over 200  percent.   The statistics are shocking, and the reality for Black mothers is a  crisis. Black mothers in Louisiana are now 4 times more likely to die  than White mothers. The rate of Black maternal deaths is closer to the  rates in developing countries than the nations we usually compare  ourselves to.   With our vast resources and advanced technology, these deaths are  unacceptable. This is a problem that demands  [[Page H4577]]  our immediate attention. That is why I am here today with this  amendment.   With this increased funding, more States can implement programs to  improve the care that mothers receive. More families can remain whole.  More children can grow up with their mothers.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Lee).    Madam Speaker, if there are no other speakers, I am  prepared to close.   Madam Speaker, let me just say, simply put, for Black women far more  than for White women, giving birth can amount to a death sentence.   When Black women express concern about their symptoms, clinicians are  more delayed and seem less likely to believe them. And the question  becomes, as Harvard put it, whether it is clinical intuition versus  unconscious bias.   So as we look around the country and we see the complications from  motherhood for African American women, we can look at Serena Williams;  we can look at Beyonce; we can look in my household; we can look at  Ashley Mitchell, whose funeral I went to just this past weekend.   This is a crisis we have the ability overcome. We are America. We do  great things when we put our mind to it, and this amendment simply asks  this body to put our mind to maternal health, especially for African  American women, but for all women in this country, to make sure that  the best thing about womanhood, an ability to give birth, does not  become a death sentence.   Madam Chair, I ask for everyone's support, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
