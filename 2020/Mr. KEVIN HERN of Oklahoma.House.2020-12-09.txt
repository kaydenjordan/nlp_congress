 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden) for yielding.   I rise in support of H.R. 1966.   This legislation was first brought to my attention by my constituent,  Carla Prothro, who is fighting cancer. We talked about the way clinical  trials impact the treatments available for cancer patients. The trials  very rarely reflect the population of cancer patients.   When women and minorities are underrepresented in clinical trials, it  negatively impacts the results. About one in five cancer trials fail  because of a lack of participation.   This bill addresses that by studying the barriers to participation  for underrepresented groups. We need to find ways to reduce those  barriers and enroll more patients from diverse backgrounds.   My niece, Juniper, is 3 years old and fighting stage 4 neuroblastoma.  She is just a little kid, but her short life has already had so much  pain. She has spent a third of her life in the hospital.   Juniper is a fighter, though, and she has so many people who love her  and are praying for her.   Bills like this help Juniper and Carla and millions of cancer  patients around the world. Every step forward in cancer research is  important. Every bit of progress gets us closer to a better world.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of H.R. 1966  today.
