 Mr. Chair, I would like to take this opportunity  to thank my colleague from Florida for yielding me some time to speak  on what I consider to be a very important issue.   Mr. Chair, I rise to strongly oppose H.R. 2910, the Promoting  Interagency Coordination for Review of Natural Gas Pipelines Act.                                time  1445    This industry-backed bill provides FERC with unnecessary authorities  that put the interest of companies over that of the people and the  environment.   The current process that FERC uses to approve pipelines is inherently  flawed, genuinely threatens our green spaces, water resources, and  public and private lands.   By allowing this bill to pass, we are permitting FERC to exclude the  input of those who would be directly impacted in exchange for  benefiting the fossil fuel industry. We need to have a more  comprehensive process that considers the effects these pipelines will  have on local communities, which is why I introduced H.R. 2649, the  Safer Pipelines Act of 2017.   My legislation is about inclusiveness, ensuring that the voice of  communities impacted by a proposed pipeline are heard loud and clear.   I have seen this problem up close.   One project before FERC is a proposed PennEast pipeline, which would  run through my congressional district. The PennEast plan has been  fraught by community concerns on issues ranging from potential  contamination of drinking water and destruction of environmentally  sensitive areas.   Despite these issues, FERC's final environmental impact statement  erroneously concluded that the project would have minimal impact.   Just last month, the New Jersey Department of Environmental  Protection rejected the construction permits due to PennEast's  continuous refusal to provide simple environmental surveys and  information requested by the State.   Not only does this bill severely threaten clean water in  environmentally sensitive areas, it also tramples on the rights of  private property owners and communities.   Jacqueline Evans of New Jersey has shared this story with us:         The farm I built with my children would be completely       destroyed by the 36-inch pipe built to the weakest standards       allowable.        The pipeline route is less than 200 feet from my children's       bedrooms, putting them in a designated ``incineration zone.''        Our well, that provides water for our family and our       livestock, is threatened.        PennEast has threatened me by insisting I sign a ``deal''       of less than 4 percent of the value of our home, or lose it       through eminent domain.        PennEast's intimidation tactics include telling us that       FERC will approve the pipeline with or without surveys and       environmental studies that are required.    Mr. Chairman, this is unacceptable.   I offered two amendments to this bill that the Rules Committee  refused to allow on the floor. One would have limited the use of  eminent domain for gas pipeline projects, and the other would have  limited the use of area remote surveys.   We cannot prioritize the wishes of private pipeline companies at the  expense of clean drinking water, our environment and natural resources,  and the rights of private owners.   So I stand here today begging my colleagues to vote for the people  and to reject this bill by voting against it.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the  desk.    I am opposed in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit the  bill with instructions to add language prohibiting the use, really the  abuse, of Federal eminent domain authority by large gas pipeline  companies.   Currently, the law allows pipeline companies--given authorization by  FERC--to circumvent landowner opposition and exercise the right of  eminent domain to acquire land necessary for pipeline construction,  which is privately owned, so that the pipeline construction can operate  and maintain--meaning for-profit pipeline companies can seize private  land from owners who are unwilling to sell.   More often than not, compensation provided to the property owner is  far from fair or just and the negotiations are rarely conducted in good  faith. In the event that fair compensation is paid, no one should be  forced to sell against their will.   The bottom line is simple: too often eminent domain authority is  exercised without the determination of a true public benefit.  Certificate holders can manipulate this authority to take whatever land  they deem necessary for their gas pipeline projects.   With the recent boom in domestic gas production, this is happening  all across the United States and harming property owners in many of our  districts. This practice is wrong, and it must be stopped.   In my home State of New Jersey, residents, including my own  constituents, are very concerned about the pending PennEast Pipeline  Project--a proposed 118-mile, 36-inch gas pipeline stretching from  northeast Pennsylvania to my district.   Their proposal crosses the property of more than 500 landowners, many  of whom have strongly objected to this project going forward.   My constituents and our neighbors who are affected by this project  will receive little, if any, local benefits from the project, because  most of the natural gas transported through the pipeline is likely  destined for markets outside of New Jersey, including for export  overseas.   PennEast would cut through districts represented by both Republicans  and Democrats, and it is opposed by my colleagues in this body on both  sides of the aisle.   Democrats and Republicans alike can agree that one of the most  important rights for all Americans is the right to own private  property. But today, the growth in gas pipeline projects threatens this  right for many Americans.   Everyone deserves a good place to live and a safe place to raise  their children. No one should have to worry about losing their hard- earned property, through no fault of their own, just to pad private  company coffers.   Preventing these private for-profit companies from having access to  the eminent domain authority in section 7(h) of the Natural Gas Act  would not only make this law better by halting abuse of that authority  by private gas pipeline companies, but also place public interests over  private profit.   This motion presents an opportunity to send a clear message to our  constituents who have worked hard to own their property and a piece of  the American Dream.   Their choice is clear, and it is yours, but I urge all of my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the motion to recommit and stand with  landowners over land takers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
