 Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of  Judge Amul Thapar to serve on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.   Judge Thapar is President Trump's first nominee to serve on a Federal  appeals court. Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee considered  this nomination and no Democrat voted for it.   Judge Thapar is on the list of 21 candidates that the Federalist  Society and Heritage Foundation have selected for President Donald  Trump to choose from when filling Supreme Court vacancies.   Judge Thapar is well known to the Federalist Society. He was a member  of that organization prior to becoming a district court judge, and  since he became a judge he has spoken at Federalist Society events 17  times.   Some of my colleagues on the Republican side are like Captain Renault  in Casablanca, who claimed he was ``shocked, shocked'' to find out  there was gambling going on in Rick's Cafe.   They are shocked that anyone could be concerned about the Federalist  Society, which they claim is just a simple debate club. Far from it-- consider the following background.   The organization was founded in 1982 by students at two law schools,  Yale and the University of Chicago, under the faculty supervision of  Robert Bork and Antonin Scalia, who just happen to be the two most  prominent conservative legal scholars of their generation.   According to a recent article about the Federalist Society by Jeffrey  Toobin: ``within just a few years, the group was embraced and funded by  a number of powerful, wealthy conservative organizations, which  eventually included foundations associated with John Olin, Lynde and  Harry Bradley, Richard Scaife, and the Koch Brothers.''   The Federalist Society's website includes the group's purpose  statement. It claims that the legal profession is: ``currently strongly  dominated by a form of orthodox liberal ideology which advocates a  centralized and uniform society.''   The statement describes the Federalist Society as a group of  conservatives and libertarians calling for: ``reordering priorities  within the legal system,'' to fit their principles. Does that sound  like the mission statement of a nonpartisan debate society?   How has the Federalist Society gone about this reordering? It's been  largely the work of Mr. Leonard Leo, the longtime executive vice  president of the Federalist Society who is currently serving as an  advisor to the Trump White House.   Mr. Leo has been credited with being a driving force behind the  Supreme Court nominations of Justice Neil Gorsuch, Chief Justice John  Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito. That is one-third of the current  Supreme Court that he has helped put in place.   Mr. Leo recently gave a speech where he said: ``I've seen that  comment about the third of the Supreme Court. I prefer controlling  interests. But we haven't quite been able to launch a hostile takeover  yet.''   Mr. Leo went on to advocate for radical change, saying: ``I would  love to see the courts unrecognizable.'' He has said of the judicial  confirmation process: ``it's like war.''   In an unprecedented move, President Trump outsourced the selection of  Supreme Court candidates to Mr. Leo, the Federalist Society, and the  right-wing Heritage Foundation. He publicly thanked these special  interest groups for putting together his list of 21 Supreme Court  candidates, and Mr. Leo was the first person to call Neil Gorsuch about  his nomination.   As Jeffrey Toobin wrote, Leonard Leo: ``knew how to play the game-- how to find a nominee who met Trump's ideological requirements as well  as his own, while observing the proprieties expected for judicial  nominees.''   Mr. Leo told Mr. Toobin that it was: ``easy'' to find these nominees  because: ``when you've been working in this vineyard for twenty-five  years you know everybody.''   That brings us back to Judge Thapar.   Leonard Leo, and the big money right-wing interests that fund the  Federalist Society, feel that they know Judge Thapar well enough to  include him on the list of 21.   They have had plenty of opportunity to get a sense of his views, as  Judge Thapar had been a member of the Federalist Society and has  frequently spoken at their events.   At his hearing and in my questions to him, I sought reassurance from  Judge Thapar that he would be independent from this right-wing group  and President Trump.   His answers did not provide that reassurance.   For example, I asked Judge Thapar whether he agreed or disagreed with  the Federalist Society's purpose statement. He ducked the question,  saying he didn't know what the Federalist Society meant by the  statement.   I asked him if he thought it was appropriate for the President to  delegate his Supreme Court selection process to the Federalist Society  and Heritage Foundation, since this creates incentive for judges not to  contravene the views of those organizations and their big-money donors.  He ducked again, saying he would not opine on this because he claimed  it was a ``political question.''   In the aftermath of Citizens United, special interest groups pour  dark money into campaigns in support of Republican judicial nominees  like Judge Thapar. I asked Judge Thapar if he would discourage secret  donations in support of his nomination.   After all, if we don't know who is secretly donating in support of  his nomination, how will we know when Judge Thapar needs to recuse  himself because one of those donors has an interest in a case he is  considering?   He dodged that question too, saying he wasn't aware of any donations  about his nomination. Of course, he wouldn't be aware of secret  donations--that's the problem.   I also asked him about the original understanding of the  Constitution's Emoluments Clause. He said he could not discuss it  because there is pending litigation on the matter.   That is curious, because I thought the Federalist Society's view was  that the original meaning of constitutional provisions was immutable  and unchanging. If the meaning of the Constitution doesn't change, why  do Federalist Society nominees decline to tell us this meaning when  there is litigation underway affecting President Trump?   I asked Judge Thapar about his decision in Winter v. Wolnitzek. This  was a major campaign finance decision in which he applied strict  scrutiny to invalidate a ban on judges making political contributions.  A unanimous Sixth Circuit panel reversed his ruling.  [[Page S3162]]    A group of 24 campaign finance reform organizations sent a letter  saying: ``Judge Thapar embraced the troubling `money is speech'  paradigm in a radical way that goes beyond Supreme Court doctrine.''  These groups oppose his confirmation, and I ask unanimous consent to  have their letter printed in the Record at the conclusion of my  remarks.   Given Judge Thapar's evasiveness on questions about his views, I am  left to judge him on his record, such as his troubling decision in the  Winter case, and the fact that the Federalist Society and Heritage  Foundation handpicked him for their judicial wish list.   I need more reassurance than that to support a nominee for a lifetime  appointment on the Federal court of appeals. I will oppose his  nomination.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                       May 17, 2017.      Senate Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators: We the undersigned organizations write to       oppose the confirmation of Judge Amul Thapar to the United       States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit due to his       troubling record on the issue of money in politics.        We are deeply concerned with the power of wealthy campaign       donors in American politics, and specifically with the       aggressive role the U.S. courts have played in undermining       our democracy by elevating the voices of a wealthy few over       the views of everyday Americans.        Much of the problem can be attributed to four decades of       flawed Supreme Court rulings. These decisions have twisted       the meaning of the First Amendment and prevented our elected       representatives and the people from enacting reasonable       protections against big money. In fact, nearly half of the       money in the 2016 federal elections--more than $3 billion--      can be directly tied to a few of the Court's most damaging       rulings.        What concerns us about Judge Thapar's record is that he has       gone beyond the Supreme Court's directives in his antagonism       towards basic rules designed to ensure we have a government       that is of, by and for the people.        In Winter v. Wolnitzek, 186 F.3d 673 (E.D. Ky. 2016), Judge       Thapar struck down a prohibition on judges making political       contributions by applying strict scrutiny to this       contribution ban, in spite of the fact that the Supreme Court       has been clear that contribution limits and bans are to be       reviewed under a lower form of scrutiny. The Sixth Circuit       overturned Judge Thapar's ruling on this point and reinstated       the contribution ban.        Further, Judge Thapar embraced the troubling ``money is       speech'' paradigm in a radical way that goes beyond Supreme       Court doctrine, writing ``there is simply no difference       between `saying' that one supports an organization by using       words and `saying' that one supports an organization by       donating money.''        Sen. Whitehouse pointed out in Judge Thapar's Senate       Judiciary Committee hearing that ``those of us who are in       politics know that that is a false statement, that it is       indeed a preposterous statement factually because money has a       completely different effect than speech once it enters the       political arena.''        The Supreme Court itself does not treat financial       contributions as being equal to actual speech. Rather, the       Court considers contributing to a campaign a form of       association or attenuated speech since the contributor does       not control the content of the communication resulting from       the contribution.        If Judge Thapar had his way, wealthy donors and special       interests could be able to give unlimited sums of money       directly to candidates for office. Thapar would make it even       harder than it is now for everyday people to be heard and       affect who runs for office, who wins elections, and what       issues get attention; and easier for powerful politicians to       make secret wink and nod deals with their richest       contributors.        Judge Thapar's responses to questioning on the subject       during his hearing and in subsequent ``questions for the       record'' did nothing to allay our concerns. In response to       Sen. Klobuchar's questions about why he applied strict       scrutiny to the contribution ban, for example, Judge Thapar       struggled to explain why he assumed (without analysis) that       the same standard should apply to contributions as to       solicitations.        The role of big money in politics became a central issue in       the debate over Justice Neil Gorsuch's confirmation to the       U.S. Supreme Court because the public cares deeply about this       issue. To ensure that all voices are heard, not just those of       powerful corporations and wealthy donors, it is essential       that we confirm judges and justices who understand that the       Constitution gives we the people the power to protect our       democracy from big money.        Unfortunately, Judge Amul Thapar does not appear to see our       pro-democracy Constitution as the vast majority of Americans       do--and for this reason we urge you to oppose his       confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth       Circuit.            Sincerely,        American Federation of Teachers, Americans for Democratic       Action, Center for American Progress, Center for Emergent       Diplomacy, Class Action, Communications Workers of America,       CODEPINK, Democracy Spring, Demos, End Citizens United, Every       Voice, Free Speech for People, Friends of the Earth, Just       Foreign Policy, Maplight, MAYDAY, National Association of       Social Workers, Participatory Politics Foundation, People for       the American Way, PeopleNow.org, Reverb Press, Small Planet       Institute, United for Democracy, Voices for Progress.    Mr. President, I would like to address the comments that  were made by the Republican majority leader about the issue of  healthcare. What he said today I have never heard him say before. He  said it was the fault of the Democrats for refusing to work with the  Republicans to change the Affordable Care Act. I had not heard that  before.   I find it an interesting suggestion because what happened after the  House of Representatives passed a measure 3 weeks ago to change the  healthcare system in America, the issue then came to the Senate but did  not go through the regular order of business.   It is my understanding--and has been reported widely in the press-- that Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, assembled a group of 13  Republican Senators who have been meeting in private over the last 3  weeks to discuss an alternative to the healthcare bill that passed in  the House of Representatives. There are no Democrats in that room. None  have been invited. Incidentally, there are no women in that room from  the Republican side--13 male Senators meeting in private.   So to hear this suggestion from the Republican leader that the real  problem they are running into is that the Democrats are not helping, we  were not invited to this party. They are meeting privately to come up  with something, and I don't know what it might be, but I have an idea  of how we can achieve a bipartisan real effort when it comes to  healthcare in America.   I would suggest we create a committee in the Senate. I have a name  for it, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. I suggest  we have 12 Republicans and 11 Democrats on that committee. I suggest  they sit down, take the bill sent by the House, and improve it, make it  better. Now, this suggestion is such a good one that the committee  already exists.   It is under the chairmanship of Lamar Alexander--whom I respect  personally very much--and the ranking member, Patty Murray of the State  of Washington, a Democrat. I know, having spoken to Senator Murray, she  is ready to roll up her sleeves and go to work to write a revision to  the healthcare bill, the healthcare system in America.   There have been no hearings, none, on the measure passed by the House  of Representatives. So when the Republican leader says he wishes the  Democrats would join in the effort, this committee is ready and willing  to work. I am sure, if he picked up the phone and called Senator  Alexander and Senator Murray, they could get to work on doing a much  better job than what the House of Representatives did.   Why am I so critical of the House of Representatives? Not because of  the traditional rivalry between the Chambers, but because yesterday the  Congressional Budget Office took a look at the bill that passed the  U.S. House of Representatives 3 weeks ago by two votes. It was all  Republicans voting for it. It passed by two. A number of Republicans  refused to support it. It had no support from the Democratic side.   It was an unusual bill because it went out of the regular order of  business. The regular order of business suggests that when you are  going to do something that might have an impact--a large impact--on  America, you should go to an agency that is a nonpartisan, expert in  the field, that will analyze your bill and tell you what impact it will  have. Most of us think we have pretty good ideas for making America a  better place to live and good ideas for legislation.   Luckily, we have something called the Congressional Budget Office,  which sometimes brings us back down to Earth and says: It might not  work exactly as you thought it would work. Traditionally, bills-- significant bills that affect a lot of Americans and families and  things important like healthcare--they are submitted to the  [[Page S3163]]  Congressional Budget Office so they can analyze them and decide the  impact they will have.   Well, 3 weeks ago, Speaker Paul Ryan and Republicans in the House  said something I had not heard before in my service in Congress. They  said: We are not going to wait for this analysis. We are going to vote  on this bill even before the Congressional Budget Office has a chance  to analyze its impact. Remember, we are talking about changing the  healthcare system in America, and that literally impacts every single  American. It is one-sixth of our Nation's economy. You would think,  before anyone was bold enough to suggest they wanted to change the  system, they would at least send their proposal to the Congressional  Budget Office for an analysis. The Republicans in the House failed to  do so, refused to do so, passed the measure by two votes, and sent it  to the Senate.   So, yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office completed its  analysis. Now that we have an analysis of what is known as TrumpCare or  the Republican healthcare approach, it is pretty clear why they did not  want the Congressional Budget Office to take a look at it. This is what  the Congressional Budget Office reported publicly last night: Next  year, under the Republican proposal for healthcare reform, 14 million  Americans will lose their health insurance. Over the next 10 years, 23  million Americans will lose their health insurance.   Do you remember when we started this conversation? The goal was to  make sure we changed the laws in America so more Americans would have  the protection of health insurance. Just the opposite occurs if the  Republican plan goes forward. The second thing we were looking for is a  goal in healthcare reform to reduce the growth, the rate of growth, in  health insurance premiums.   Every one of us knows what that is all about. Health insurance  premiums have been going up way too high for way too long. The  Republicans have been critical of the current system, saying the cost  of health insurance is going up too fast. So they put in their reform  proposal which passed the House of Representatives.   Here is what the Congressional Budget Office had to say about the  Republican approach: Next year, premiums for health insurance will  increase by 20 percent in the individual market. That is the market  where we have seen this dramatic growth in costs already, and the  Republican plan makes it worse.   The third thing we find is this argument by the Republicans that  somehow the current healthcare system in America, the Affordable Care  Act, is in a death spiral. Listen to what the Congressional Budget  Office said about the health insurance market in America today. The CBO  affirms that under current law, marketplaces--health insurance  marketplaces--are stable.   However, under the Republican repeal bill, one out of every six  Americans will be living in parts of this country where the individual  market would become unstable as a result of the Republican bill. So  instead of stabilizing the market and ending the so-called death  spiral, the Republican bill makes it worse.   It turns out that when you take a close look at this so-called death  spiral, you find the Republicans have their hands around the throats of  the healthcare system of America choking it and claiming this patient  is not looking good, Doctor. If they would stop their efforts to  sabotage the current system and work to improve it and make it  stronger, then we could save health insurance for a lot of Americans  and bring stability to the system.    The Republican bill at its heart is not about a healthcare bill,  though, it is about tax cuts. The Republican proposal for healthcare  reform starts with eliminating almost $900 billion in taxes paid by the  wealthiest people in America. By taking $900 billion out of the  healthcare system, they are unable to keep health insurance alive for  so many Americans. The Republican approach eliminates $834 billion in  the Federal Medicaid Program. What is the Federal Medicaid Program? Let  me give you three examples of what it is.   In Illinois today, half of the babies who are born are paid for-- their medical care is paid for by the Medicaid system: prenatal care  for mom so the baby is healthy, the delivery of the baby, and postnatal  care afterward. These are lower income individuals. Half of them are  paid for by Medicaid today, but that is not the most expensive part of  Medicaid.   The most expensive part of Medicaid is for your mom and dad and your  grandmother and grandfather who are in a nursing home and have no  savings left. All they have is Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.  That is the most expensive part of Medicaid. Those who are disabled  living in my State, in Alabama, in New York, and other States--disabled  people and low-income people need medical care and they rely on  Medicaid.   So when the Republican healthcare reform and repeal cuts $800  billion-plus out of Medicaid, it is at the expense of the groups I just  mentioned: babies and moms, elderly people in nursing homes, and the  disabled. Those are the ones who will see a cutback in medical services  so we can give a $900 billion tax cut to the wealthiest people in  America.   I know the Democratic leader is here. I want to yield the floor when  he arrives, but I want to close by telling a story. Yesterday, I had  three moms and a dad who brought their children to a press conference.  It was a great press conference, if I may say so. These kids stole the  show, as they should. Each one of them--each one of them had a  compelling story about having survived a terrible illness. Many of them  were cancer victims.   Moms told stories. One mom said: I was changing my little girl, and I  noticed a lump in her abdomen. It turned out to be a neuroblastoma  cancer tumor. It was removed. My little girl spent weeks, months in the  hospital, and she is still going back.   Each one of them told a story. As you looked at these kids, smiling  and happy and bouncing around, you thought to yourself: Thank goodness.  Thank goodness for America, with its great medical care, and thank  goodness these families had health insurance--because they were there  concerned about what the Republicans are doing when it comes to  preexisting conditions.   Because these kids have survived cancer, they are risky from an  insurance viewpoint. We decided 6 years ago to put an end to that worry  for these families. You cannot discriminate against a person or a  family in America based on a preexisting condition--thank goodness-- because one out of three of us have a preexisting condition. The  Republican approach takes away that protection and says Governors can  ask for a waiver so health insurance in their State can discriminate  against people with preexisting conditions.   So three moms and a dad came yesterday and said: Please stop this  Republican plan. What will our families do? Our kids have preexisting  conditions. We cannot afford to see our premiums go through the roof  because the Republicans withdraw this protection.   That is the real-life consequence of this debate. This is not just  about a lot of politicians on Capitol Hill blowing hot air. It is about  families--real families with real kids and real challenges and whether  they are going to have real protection when they need it.   The Congressional Budget Office yesterday came out with a report and  said the measure that passed the House, the Republican measure, is a  disaster for families across America. We have to stop it. We have to do  everything in our power to do it. I might say to my friend from New  York, the Democratic leader, that when the Republican leader came to  the floor this morning and said: Why won't the Democrats join us in  repairing the Affordable Care Act? I say to the Republican leader: Open  the door of that room where you have 13 male Republican Senators  sitting down and debating the future of healthcare. Open the door, open  the windows, and let's have an honest, open, bipartisan conversation  not about repealing our healthcare system but making it stronger,  protecting the very families who showed up yesterday at a press  conference and whom I am going to remember for a long time.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Washington (Ms.  Cantwell), the Senator from Hawaii (Ms. Hirono), the Senator from  Hawaii (Mr. Schatz), and the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Udall), are  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I have two words for Bill Dauster: Thank  you.   Thank you, Bill Dauster, for your brilliant mind and unwearying  service to the U.S. Senate, to the American people, and to America's  most noble ideals.   Thank you for your good humor, and thank you for your endless supply  of good ideas.   The Senate is going to miss you.   In Steven Spielberg's Movie ``Lincoln,'' with Daniel Day-Lewis, there  is a scene in which President Lincoln is talking with Congressman  Thaddeus Stephens of Pennsylvania, played by Tommy Lee Jones.  [[Page S3203]]    Thaddeus Stephens was one of the most righteous, uncompromising  abolitionists in all of American history--and thank goodness for him.   In the movie, he tells President Lincoln that there is no use in  appealing to the moral decency of slaveholders and their allies to end  slavery and racial discrimination.   The reason, he says, is that ``the inner compass that should direct  the soul toward justice has ossified''--become utterly useless-- ``through tolerating the evil of slavery.''   President Lincoln's reply was so wise. He said, ``A compass, I learnt  when I was surveying, . . . it'll point you True North from where you'e  standing, but it's got no advice about the swamps and desert and chasm  that you'll encounter along the way.''   He went on to say,``If in pursuit of your destination, you plunge  ahead, heedless of obstacles, and achieve nothing more than to sink in  a swamp, what's the use of knowing True North?''   There is a lesson in that story for all of us.   Passing laws in our democracy requires more than passion and more  than clever speeches.   Passing laws requires legislative skill. It requires mastery of  parliamentary procedure and arcane rules. That is how we avoid the  ``swamps and desert and chasms'' that President Lincoln spoke of.   Bill Dauster knows more about the rules of the Senate than probably  anyone since Senator Robert C. Byrd. That has made him something of a  legend in the Senate, on both sides of the aisle.   But what makes him even more admirable is the reason that Bill  Dauster has mastered the mechanics of lawmaking.   Bill has worked for a lot of big names in American politics, but it  is dignity and justice and fairness for the little guy that has always  driven him.   In 30-plus years, he left the Senate only twice, for brief stretches.  Once was to be President Bill Clinton's deputy assistant for economic  policy during the golden years of a budget surplus. The other time was  in 1998 and 1999, to work on the Presidential exploratory committee of  Senator Paul Wellstone.   Paul Wellstone used to say: ``I didn't come to the Senate to fight  for the Rockefellers. They have enough lobbyists. I'm here to fight for  the little feller.''   That could be Bill Dauster's motto too.   Bill Dauster has the rare sort of vision in which no one is  invisible, no one is so small that they are undeserving of respect.   Bill isn't the only dedicated public servant in his family. His  equally brilliant wife, Ellen Weintraub, has served as a commissioner  on the Federal Election Commission since 2002.   They are the parents of three grown children, Matthew, Natanya, and  Emma.   We thank the entire Dauster-Weintraub family for sharing Bill with  us.   Somehow, even with the obligations of work and family, Bill has found  the time to be something of a Talmudic scholar.   So let me end with this thought, from the ancient Taludic sage, Rabbi  Tarfon, who wrote, ``Do not be daunted by the enormity of the world's  grief. Do justly, now. Love mercy, now. Walk humbly, now. You are not  obligated to complete the work, but neither are you free to abandon  it.''   For 30 years, Bill Dauster has helped this Senate pass laws that have  made life more just and more merciful for untold multitudes, in America  and around the world. Although he is leaving the Senate, I know he wil  never abandon that work.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1262         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fairness for Struggling       Students Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. EXCEPTIONS TO DISCHARGE.         Section 523(a)(8) of title 11, United States Code, is       amended by striking ``dependents, for'' and all that follows       through the end of subparagraph (B) and inserting       ``dependents, for an educational benefit overpayment or loan       made, insured, or guaranteed by a governmental unit or made       under any program funded in whole or in part by a       governmental unit or an obligation to repay funds received       from a governmental unit as an educational benefit,       scholarship, or stipend;''.     Today I am reintroducing the Fairness for Struggling  Students Act. This bill takes an important step toward addressing the  student debt crisis in America. It would once again treat private  student loans like nearly all other forms of private unsecured debt and  permit these loans to be discharged in bankruptcy.   Student loan debt has reached an astronomical $1.4 trillion--more  than double what it was in 2008. Student loan debt is now the second  largest form of consumer debt in America, after only mortgage debt. The  balance of student loan debt is larger than credit card and auto loan  debt. Currently, around 44 million borrowers hold student loan debt,  with an average balance of roughly $30,000.   This past weekend, the New York Times published an editorial that  clearly and concisely describes the student debt crisis that we face.  The editorial is titled ``Student Debt's Grip on the Economy,'' and I  ask consent to place it into the Record. As the editorial points out,  ``student debt has become a drag on graduates' hopes and a threat to  economic growth.''   This editorial reports that as college costs have continued to  increase, wages have not kept pace. Students continue to take out  larger amounts in loans to afford the rising costs of college. This  crushing student loan debt has forced young people to delay making  important life decisions like getting married and economic investments  such as home ownership. We are also seeing an increase in the wealth  gap between college graduates with student debt and those without  student debt. The burdens of student debt are threatening the notion  that being college-educated is enough to get ahead. As the editorial  notes, ``the fallout from these burdens, afflicting those who are  supposedly best prepared to face and shape the future, is not only a  personal financial issue but also a social and economic one.''   These burdens are even more significant for students who have taken  out private student loans. Federal student loans have fixed, affordable  interest rates, and a variety of consumer protections including  forbearance in times of economic hardship and manageable repayment  options. Private loans, on the other hand, frequently have high,  variable interest rates, and they lack the repayment options and  protections that federal loans offer. In 2013, the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau reported that the outstanding private student loan  debt in America was $165 billion, at least $8 billion of which was then  in default. As it turns out, many students were steered into costly  private student loans by for-profit colleges, often when the students  still had eligibility for lower-cost federal loans.   One of those students is a woman named Marta, from Chicago, who wrote  to me about her story and asked me to only use her first name. Marta  came to the United States from Poland in 1994 with her family, hoping  for a better life. She is a U.S. citizen now, and has a family of her  own. As an aspiring designer, Marta wanted to enroll in a college that  would help launch her career. So after meeting a recruiter at a college  fair from the now-closing, for-profit Harrington College of Art and  Design, she enrolled in the fall of 2004. At the urging of the  recruiter, she signed the enrollment paperwork and began courses. Being  the first in her family to attend college, she did not know the  difference between private and federal student loans. The recruiter  assured her that the paperwork was just part of the normal college  enrollment process.   It was only after she graduated that Marta learned that in signing  the paperwork the recruiter gave her, she had taken out a combination  of federal student loans and much riskier and more expensive private  student loans. She now has over $120,000 in student debt, the majority  of which is in private student loans. The monthly payments are  overwhelming and Marta worries about what this crushing debt means for  her family's future. Thanks to high-interest rates, her private loans  continue to grow despite doing her best to make her payments.   Marta enrolled in college to get a good career and widen her future  opportunities. But she has been left with enormous debt from a failed  for-profit college. And now she is struggling and needs a fair chance  to get back on her feet. There are stories like Marta's in every corner  of America. And it's time to do something about it.   Today I am reintroducing the Fairness for Struggling Students Act.  This bill would restore the bankruptcy code's pre-2005 treatment of  private student loans.   Since 2005, private student loans have enjoyed a privileged status  under the bankruptcy code: they cannot be discharged in bankruptcy  except in extremely limited circumstances. Only a few other types of  private unsecured debt cannot be discharged in bankruptcy--criminal  fines, child support, back taxes and alimony. In contrast, nearly all  types of private unsecured debt, including credit card and medical  debt, are dischargeable in bankruptcy.   Congress had no good reason to make private student loans non- dischargeable in 2005. It was a provision that was quietly slipped into  a broader bankruptcy reform bill with little debate and no  justification. There was no evidence that private student loan  borrowers had abused the bankruptcy system to avoid repayment before  2005. But, since the law changed in 2005, lenders have been  incentivized to extend expensive private student loans to students that  the students cannot repay and that they can never escape. This is  overwhelming for students and an impairment on our overall economy.   The Fairness for Struggling Students Act will make important relief  available to students being crushed by private student loan debt, and  will discourage private lenders from extending risky loans.  [[Page S3218]]    This bill is supported by a large coalition of educational, student,  civil rights and consumer organizations including the American  Association of Community Colleges, American Association of State  Colleges and Universities, American Association of University Women,  American Council on Education, American Federation of Teachers,  Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, Center for  Responsible Lending, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America,  Consumers Union, Demos, Empire Justice Center, NAACP, National  Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys, National Consumer Law  Center (on behalf of its low income clients), National Association of  College Admission Counseling, National Association of Consumer  Advocates, National Association of Student Financial Aid  Administrators, National Consumers League, Public Citizen, The  Institute for College Access and Success, UNCF, and Young Invincibles.   I want to thank the cosponsors of this bill, Senators Whitehouse,  Franken, Blumenthal, Hirono, Warren, Reed, Wyden, Baldwin, Hassan,  Kaine, and Murphy for their support, and I hope more of my colleagues  will join us.   This is just one step of what we need to do to get control of the  student debt crisis in our country. But it is a critical step, and it  is long overdue. Let's give struggling students a fair chance,                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS:   S. 1264. A bill to amend the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to allow  the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to exempt certain depository  institutions from certain legal requirements, and for other purposes;  to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1262         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fairness for Struggling       Students Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. EXCEPTIONS TO DISCHARGE.         Section 523(a)(8) of title 11, United States Code, is       amended by striking ``dependents, for'' and all that follows       through the end of subparagraph (B) and inserting       ``dependents, for an educational benefit overpayment or loan       made, insured, or guaranteed by a governmental unit or made       under any program funded in whole or in part by a       governmental unit or an obligation to repay funds received       from a governmental unit as an educational benefit,       scholarship, or stipend;''.     Today I am reintroducing the Fairness for Struggling  Students Act. This bill takes an important step toward addressing the  student debt crisis in America. It would once again treat private  student loans like nearly all other forms of private unsecured debt and  permit these loans to be discharged in bankruptcy.   Student loan debt has reached an astronomical $1.4 trillion--more  than double what it was in 2008. Student loan debt is now the second  largest form of consumer debt in America, after only mortgage debt. The  balance of student loan debt is larger than credit card and auto loan  debt. Currently, around 44 million borrowers hold student loan debt,  with an average balance of roughly $30,000.   This past weekend, the New York Times published an editorial that  clearly and concisely describes the student debt crisis that we face.  The editorial is titled ``Student Debt's Grip on the Economy,'' and I  ask consent to place it into the Record. As the editorial points out,  ``student debt has become a drag on graduates' hopes and a threat to  economic growth.''   This editorial reports that as college costs have continued to  increase, wages have not kept pace. Students continue to take out  larger amounts in loans to afford the rising costs of college. This  crushing student loan debt has forced young people to delay making  important life decisions like getting married and economic investments  such as home ownership. We are also seeing an increase in the wealth  gap between college graduates with student debt and those without  student debt. The burdens of student debt are threatening the notion  that being college-educated is enough to get ahead. As the editorial  notes, ``the fallout from these burdens, afflicting those who are  supposedly best prepared to face and shape the future, is not only a  personal financial issue but also a social and economic one.''   These burdens are even more significant for students who have taken  out private student loans. Federal student loans have fixed, affordable  interest rates, and a variety of consumer protections including  forbearance in times of economic hardship and manageable repayment  options. Private loans, on the other hand, frequently have high,  variable interest rates, and they lack the repayment options and  protections that federal loans offer. In 2013, the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau reported that the outstanding private student loan  debt in America was $165 billion, at least $8 billion of which was then  in default. As it turns out, many students were steered into costly  private student loans by for-profit colleges, often when the students  still had eligibility for lower-cost federal loans.   One of those students is a woman named Marta, from Chicago, who wrote  to me about her story and asked me to only use her first name. Marta  came to the United States from Poland in 1994 with her family, hoping  for a better life. She is a U.S. citizen now, and has a family of her  own. As an aspiring designer, Marta wanted to enroll in a college that  would help launch her career. So after meeting a recruiter at a college  fair from the now-closing, for-profit Harrington College of Art and  Design, she enrolled in the fall of 2004. At the urging of the  recruiter, she signed the enrollment paperwork and began courses. Being  the first in her family to attend college, she did not know the  difference between private and federal student loans. The recruiter  assured her that the paperwork was just part of the normal college  enrollment process.   It was only after she graduated that Marta learned that in signing  the paperwork the recruiter gave her, she had taken out a combination  of federal student loans and much riskier and more expensive private  student loans. She now has over $120,000 in student debt, the majority  of which is in private student loans. The monthly payments are  overwhelming and Marta worries about what this crushing debt means for  her family's future. Thanks to high-interest rates, her private loans  continue to grow despite doing her best to make her payments.   Marta enrolled in college to get a good career and widen her future  opportunities. But she has been left with enormous debt from a failed  for-profit college. And now she is struggling and needs a fair chance  to get back on her feet. There are stories like Marta's in every corner  of America. And it's time to do something about it.   Today I am reintroducing the Fairness for Struggling Students Act.
