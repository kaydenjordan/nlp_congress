 Madam President, I am happy to report this morning that  the leadership of both parties have finalized the organizing resolution  for the Senate. We will pass the resolution through the Senate today,  which means that committees can promptly set up and get to work--with  Democrats holding the gavels.   For the information of the Senate, the Democratic caucus has  announced its committee memberships for the next 2 years. I am  confident our Members are ready to hit the ground running on the most  important issues that face our country.   Senate Democrats are not going to waste any time taking on the  biggest challenges facing our country and our planet. I have already  instructed the incoming Democratic chairs of all relevant committees to  begin holding hearings on the climate crisis in preparation for  enacting President Biden's Build Back Better agenda, which includes  major climate legislation.   It is long past time for the Senate to take a leading role to combat  the existential threat of our time--climate. As we all know, climate  change touches virtually every aspect of our economy and involves  virtually every aspect of public policy. So as the Biden Administration  prepares a whole-of-government approach to combating climate change,  the Democratic majority will pursue a whole-of-Senate approach as well.   Some of this work has already started. Two years ago, Senate  Democrats established the first-ever Senate Special Committee on the  Climate Crisis. I have promised that any action we take on  infrastructure, in particular, will prioritize green infrastructure and  the creation of green jobs, and create many jobs--good-paying jobs--we  will.   Personally, I have introduced legislation to speed our country's  transition toward clean cars that has the support of the environmental  community, the labor unions, and some of the car manufacturers.   Make no mistake, in several different ways, this Democratic majority  will compel the Senate to forcefully, relentlessly, and urgently  address climate change, beginning with work in all of the relevant  committees.   So as we set up new committee structures, I look forward to working  with the new Democratic chairs on ways their committees will address  the climate crisis. I look forward to speaking  [[Page S274]]  with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle about finding some  common ground on this issue. And, most importantly, I look forward to  propelling this Chamber into action on a crisis that concerns not only  all of our futures but the futures of our children and our  grandchildren. It is our solemn obligation to leave behind a planet  upon which future generations can grow and prosper.                                 Coronavirus    Madam President, now on COVID, yesterday afternoon the Senate took  the first step in preparing the rescue package for an economy and a  country that is still in the throes of crisis. The $1.9 trillion budget  resolution is designed to meet the needs of a country that has been  devastated by disease and recession for nearly a year. It has been such  a long time. We need real help.   Unlike most crises, which affect one particular sector of the economy  or another, one part of the country or another, the COVID-19 pandemic  affects the entire country and nearly every aspect of American life.  There is not one person in America, in my judgment, whose life hasn't  been significantly changed by this awful crisis. The challenges we must  overcome are manifold. So we must produce a bill that addresses each of  those changes and challenges in turn--housing and agriculture and  education, help for th unemployed, small businesses, our healthcare  system, and our State and local governments. And we cannot fall short  of the needs of each of those areas.    History has taught us hard lessons about the cost of small thinking  during times of big challenge and about the cost of delay during  moments of great urgency.   Secretary Yellen told the Democratic caucus yesterday that it is her  belief that if Congress fails to dedicate the necessary resources to  meet the needs of the American people and survive this crisis, we will  see long-term scarring in our economy and our country would be mired in  the COVID crisis for years.   The income inequality and wealth inequality that plagues our Nation  has been exacerbated by this crisis because it is certainly the lower  half of the American people who have suffered the most and needs to be  remediated. And that is what we aim to do.   We must not--must not--repeat the mistakes of the past and do too  little, too reluctantly, and too late. We will not repeat the mistakes  of the past.   Our goal is simple: to help the American people and the American  economy and do it fast. Over the next 2 days, the Senate will be in  session for debate on the budget resolution. There will be an open  bipartisan amendment process. We invite participation from both sides  of the aisle in that process, but I urge Members not to lose sight of  what this legislation will mean for the American people.   For Americans who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own,  this rescue package will extend enhanced unemployment benefits. For  parents--I have spoken to so many who are desperate for the day they  can send their children back to school safely--this rescue package will  include resources for schools to make that happen quicker. For teachers  and firefighters and busdrivers and nurses worried about the fate of  their jobs, this rescue package will follow through on providing aid  for State and local governments. For restaurants and bars, for theaters  and farmers, for small businesses of every stripe, this rescue package  will make another round of Federal loans and grants available to you.  And for every American struggling to make ends meet, who, month by  month, has fallen further behind on the rent or mortgage, who has the  power or the heat or the water shut off, for every American who has had  to choose which meal they were going to skip that day, this rescue  package will send direct assistance in the form of a check.   And, of course, this rescue package will support the production and  distribution of the vaccine that is the key to ending the crisis. The  past administration--in terms of distribution, in terms of working with  the States to get these vaccines out--has been so derelict. It has been  one of the greatest failures of any Presidency. The new Biden  Administration is focused on making more vaccines, getting them out  quickly, getting them out fairly, and doing it effectively and  efficiently. We have to help get that done.   So I, alongside the Democratic committee chairs responsible for  drafting this legislation, will be meeting with President Biden at the  White House today, a few hours from now. Our caucus is eager to discuss  next steps, and we are united in our resolve to deliver on a rescue  plan that provides the American people the relief they so desperately  need.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. I won't be that  long                            Organizing Resolution    Madam President, in addition to the organizing resolution to which  the Republican leader and I have now agreed, Leader McConnell and I  would like to engage in a colloquy regarding certain understandings we  have reached on two related issues.   First, I have discussed with the Republican leader concerns that have  been raised by many Senators about the floor procedure known as  ``filling the amendment tree.'' At various points over the last several  decades, Senators have been prevented from actively participating in  the legislative process because the ability of Senators to offer and  receive votes on amendments has been severely restricted. I appreciate  and understand those concerns, and I want to assure Senators that it is  my intention to have active and dynamic debates on the many issues and  crises facing our Nation today. The 117th Congress will not shirk from  the important issues; rather, we will discuss and debate legislative  solutions to them. I am a strong supporter of the right of Senators to  offer amendments and commit to increase dramatically the number of  Member-initiated amendments offered in the 117th Congress. I am also  opposed to limiting amendments by ``filling the tree'' unless dilatory  measures prevent the Senate from taking action and leave no  alternative. Senators from both sides will be able to offer amendments.  That is how we will operate in the 117th Congress under the new  Democratic majority.    Madam President, I thank the Republican leader for those  assurances and for his cooperation in reaching agreement on the  organizing resolution and the understandings we have just described. I  look forward to working with him and all Senators to address the many  urgent needs confronting our Nation.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S.
