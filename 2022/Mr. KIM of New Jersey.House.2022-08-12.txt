 Madam Speaker, in 2018, I was at a home in a  retirement community along the Jersey Shore. A gentleman pulled me  aside and, in a whispered voice, shared with me that he pays over $500  a month for prescription drugs and couldn't keep up. He resorted to  halving his pills.   He told me he was a proud man, but I could hear a quiver in his voice  because he felt bad that he couldn't provide for himself and his wife.  He said he worked hard for his entire life, but he can't do this on his  own.   I told him that it was not his fault, that prices had been  skyrocketing, that Medicare had not been able to negotiate prices, and  that here in the richest, most powerful Nation in the world, those who  worked hard over the course of their lives are left to fend for  themselves, halving their medication. How sad is that?   I come to the floor of the House today to say that this stops here.   Medicare will be able to negotiate, and because of that gentleman and  many others I heard from, I decided to help author the provision to cap  the out-of-pocket costs for seniors at $2,000 a year, which is about  $166 a month. Seniors have been waiting too long, and it is time now to  get this done.
