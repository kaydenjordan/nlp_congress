 Mr. Speaker, protecting the right of every American to  practice their religion is a fundamental tenet of our Constitution.  That includes defending the security of churches, synagogues, mosques,  temples, and other religiously affiliated institutions where Americans  gather together to follow their faith.   This year, we have seen the troubling rise in anti-Semitic incidents  in the United States, including bomb threats, vandalism, and cemetery  desecrations. One of the most frequent targets have been Jewish  community centers, or JCCs, including in my home State of Illinois,  including the one in my very own community where my kids attended and  played basketball and other sports to connect with their community.   These despicable threats aim to sow fear in families and communities.  And they target our most vulnerable children in preschool, Hebrew  school, or teens simply coming together to make friends.   Mr. Speaker, no parent in America should have to worry about the  safety of their family because of their faith, yet current Federal law  does not consider threats against community religious centers as hate  crimes. It is unacceptable to limit the consequences faced by the  perpetrators of this terror to misdemeanor charges. We need to fix  this.   I am proud to have cosponsored this bipartisan legislation, to allow  individuals, who make bomb threats and other credible threats of  violence against community religious centers, to be prosecuted to the  fullest extent of the law for committing a hate crime.   I thank my colleague from Washington for conceiving this important  idea and inspiring this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House to follow the example  of the Judiciary Committee and pass H.R. 1730, the Protecting  Religiously Affiliated Institutions Act, with overwhelming bipartisan  support.
