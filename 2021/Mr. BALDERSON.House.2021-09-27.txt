 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the Biden  administration's attack on American energy production.   Last month, as America faced 40 percent higher prices at the pump as  a result of his failed policies, President Biden found himself begging  OPEC to open the valve to alleviate the pinch of skyrocketing prices.  To no one's surprise, OPEC refused.   Earlier this year, in a baffling sequence of events on his very first  day in office, President Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline  project, eliminating 11,000 U.S. energy jobs here at home.                                time  2015    And then he gave a green light to Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline  across Europe. Perhaps most appalling is that the Nord Stream 2  decision was made in the wake of Russian hackers shutting down the  Colonial Pipeline, affecting tens of millions of American up and down  the East coast.   These misguided policy decisions by the Biden administration have  caused irreparable harm, not just to the U.S., but also to our European  allies who are growing increasingly weary of how the Kremlin may use  its newfound grasp on the region's energy supplies to advance their  geopolitical influence.   Destroying American energy production under the false pretense that  doing so is somehow saving the environment is nothing more than a  mismatch of problems and solutions. It is a disastrous display of  virtue-signaling.   Meanwhile, in the midst of soaring inflation, American taxpayers are  the ones left paying the price, robbed of both reliable energy options  and their hard-earned money.   Madam Speaker, the Biden administration's policies are damaging  American energy independence and security. We must reverse course and  return to a path of American energy leadership, not foreign reliance.
