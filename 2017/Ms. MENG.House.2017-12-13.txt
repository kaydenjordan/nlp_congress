 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment that I think  every Member of this body can support, no matter how they intend to  vote on final passage of H.R. 1638.   This amendment simply seeks to insert a single new requirement into  the report required by H.R. 1638, and that new requirement is as  follows: ``an assessment of the impact and effectiveness of U.S.  economic sanctions programs against Iran.''                                time  1615    Whether you voted for the Iran deal or against it, or whether you  think economic sanctions are an effective diplomatic tool or something  that sounds better than it is, I hope Members will support this  amendment.   We should make evidence-based policy decisions in this body, whenever  [[Page H9878]]  possible, and, toward that end, we should know whether or not the  sanctions that we pass here work.   If we are going to require a new report from the Treasury in this  bill, and that report must include ``a description of how Treasury  assesses the impact and effectiveness of U.S. economic sanctions  programs against Iran,'' I think it is only appropriate to ask for the  assessment itself; and that is what this amendment does.   Let me put it another way. Understanding how we count votes in  America is important, but at the end of an election, I want to know the  final tally. Who won? Who lost? What did we learn?   Similarly, I think it is important that if the Treasury is going to  have to produce a new report on sanctions against Iran pursuant to H.R.  1638, that we understand exactly how the Treasury intends to assess the  impact and effectiveness of those sanctions.   Even more importantly, though, I think this report should include the  results of that assessment, particularly when it comes to sanctions we  have authorized. That is all this amendment seeks to require, and I  hope everyone in this body will support it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
