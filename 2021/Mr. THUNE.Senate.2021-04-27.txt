 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, a few weeks ago, President Biden introduced  an infrastructure plan--or at least that is what the Democrats are  calling it. In fact, a substantial portion of this bill goes to  Democratic priorities that have nothing to do with infrastructure, from  support for Big Labor to a new Civilian Climate Corps to advance  ``environmental justice.'' President Biden's infrastructure proposal  would cost a lot of money, well north of $2 trillion.   So how does the President plan to pay for this legislation?  Unsurprisingly, the President is proposing tax hikes--notably, a  substantial hike in the corporate tax rate.   There are two sources the Democrats like to go to when it comes to  paying for their spending--corporations and prosperous Americans. In  fact, the Democrats tend to speak about corporations and well-off  Americans as if they are a bottomless source of funding for government  programs and as if the Democrats can endlessly hike taxes on these  individuals and businesses without consequences.   When the Republicans object to the prospect of major tax hikes, the  Democrats cry that the Republicans are just protecting wealthy  corporate cronies--a deeply ironic charge when you consider that the  Democrats want to include a tax cut for wealthy Democratic donors and  Hollywood types in this same infrastructure package.   The real reason for the Republicans' concern, of course, is quite  different. The Republicans are concerned about substantial tax hikes on  any individual or business because we know that taxation has economic  consequences. It is something that the Democrats should know as well-- it is basic economics, after all--but they don't seem capable of  grasping it. Taxation has consequences. Tax hikes have consequences,  and big tax hikes have big consequences, usually negative ones.   The corporate tax hike the Democrats are talking about will have  negative consequences for American businesses. That means it will have  negative consequences for American workers, and that is a problem.   Three years ago, the Republicans passed major tax reform legislation.  Along with substantial tax cuts for middle-class Americans, this  legislation cut America's corporate tax rate. Why? Well, at the time we  passed this legislation, the United States had the highest corporate  tax rate in the developed world, plus an outdated international tax  system. Both of those things put U.S. businesses at a major  disadvantage next to their foreign counterparts, and they discouraged  foreign companies from moving to and investing in the United States.   Our outdated tax system had also resulted in a wave of inversions.  That is tax professional-speak for companies moving their headquarters  overseas. According to Bloomberg, between 2004 and 2016, 36 American- based companies  [[Page S2206]]  inverted. Needless to say, those inversions resulted in a loss of  American jobs and domestic investment. A piece in the Wall Street  Journal reported that one accounting firm estimates that the United  States lost $510 billion from cross-border mergers and acquisitions  between 2004 and 2016.   The Republicans knew that if we wanted to boost job creation here at  home and improve opportunities for American workers, we needed to  address the high corporate tax rate and put American companies on a  more competitive footing internationally, so we cut the corporate tax  rate and brought the U.S. international tax system into the 21st  century by replacing our outdated worldwide system with a modernized  territorial tax system.   It didn't take long to see the results: Inversions ended. Economic  growth outstripped predictions. The poverty rate dropped. Jobs  increased. Incomes grew. In fact, income growth in 2019 was the highest  ever recorded, and the real median household income for African- American, Hispanic, and Asian-American workers hit record highs. In  other words, tax reform worked, and, importantly, it worked for the  very people the Republicans wanted to help--ordinary Americans. By  improving the tax situation for American businesses, we improved the  job and income situation for American workers, but now the Democrats  want to undo all of that.   To pay for their preferred government programs, they want to  substantially hike the tax rate on American corporations--once again,  putting American businesses at a substantial disadvantage next to their  foreign competitors. If the Democrats impose President Biden's  suggested tax hike, the combined average top tax rate on corporations  in the United States will be higher than that imposed by every one of  our major trading partners and competitors, including China.   It is difficult to understand why the Democrats think it is a good  idea to put American companies at a disadvantage next to Chinese  companies and next to British companies, Japanese companies, French  companies, German companies, and the list goes on and on. It is  especially difficult to understand why the Democrats would do this now,  at the very time our economy is trying to recover from the serious hit  we took from the coronavirus.    Unfortunately, it has become clear that the Democrats are either  incapable of grasping or don't care about the economic consequences of  their proposed tax hikes. The Democrats are fixated on imposing a whole  host of new government programs, and they are ready to tax Americans  and American businesses to pay for them even if ordinary Americans  suffer as a result. Presumably, they think that if ordinary Americans  start suffering, they can just offer them some help through a new  government program, but I am pretty confident that most Americans would  exchange government assistance for the kinds of jobs and incomes that  free them from having to depend on government programs.   Substantially increasing the corporate tax rate--and I am talking  substantially; what is being talked about is a 33-percent increase, so  it will be a one-third increase in the tax rate--and putting American  businesses at a disadvantage on the global stage is not the best way to  encourage the creation of those kinds of jobs. Hiking the corporate tax  rate will have negative consequences for our economy and for hard- working Americans.   It is easy to say ``Tax the corporations; tax the rich people,'' but  those businesses hire American workers. If they have to pay more in  taxes, they have to pay less in wages. What we saw, as I mentioned  before, was the highest wage increases that we have seen in decades,  particularly for lower income Americans.   But apparently what is being talked about with this tax hike is just  the beginning. President Biden and his Democratic colleagues have a lot  more government programs they want to push, and they have a whole raft  of tax hikes waiting in the wings to fund them. There is a hike in the  top individual income tax rate that would hit small businesses hard.  Most businesses--99 percent of the businesses in my State of South  Dakota--are organized as passthroughs. That means they pay taxes at the  individual rate. Those are farmers and ranchers and small business  people across my State. They are the people who create the jobs in  South Dakota. A hike in the top individual income tax rate hits every  one of those small businesses that has an income in excess of $400,000.  That is money that could be used to hire more workers. There is a hike  in the capital gains tax, which would discourage investment and  decrease the value Americans can expect from their 401(k)s, a new death  tax that would hit middle-class families and family farms and  businesses, and so much more.   These tax hikes may help the Democrats usher in parts of the  socialist fantasy they have been envisioning, but they will do nothing  to help American families gain financial stability and secure good jobs  and lasting, rewarding careers. Working Americans are the ones who will  ultimately suffer the most from the Democrats' tax hike plans.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
