 Mr. President, I am here this afternoon to speak about  the amendment to address sanctions on Russia, but I want to preface my  remarks by saying, like all of us here in the Capitol today, that my  thoughts are with Congressman Scalise and with the staff member, the  two Capitol police officers, and others who were part of the terrible  tragedy this morning. In particular, I want to salute the officers  involved, whose courage and professionalism undoubtedly saved many  lives, and I join with the entire Senate family in hoping for a full  recovery for everyone involved.                        Amendment No. 232, as Modified    Mr. President, in a few minutes, we will vote on a bipartisan  amendment to strengthen sanctions on Russia and to mandate rigorous  congressional review of any effort to loosen the sanctions regime. I am  pleased to cosponsor this amendment, which has real teeth, including  provisions that I advocated for to prevent sanctioned individuals from  using family members to circumvent sanctions.   I am also pleased that the amendment includes congressional review of  any decision to restore Russia's access to non-Embassy compounds that  were seized at the end of last year in the United States. I think this  is not the time to grant Russia such privileges, especially given that  it would bolster their intelligence-gathering capabilities.   I am pleased that this is a bipartisan amendment, thanks to the  leadership of the chair and ranking member of the Foreign Relations  Committee, on which I serve, Chair Corker and Ranking Member Cardin, as  well as the chair and ranking member of the Banking Committee, Senator  Crapo, who is here, and Ranking Member Brown. They worked very hard to  come up with a bipartisan agreement.   I also want to recognize Senators McCain and Graham, whose work on  the underlying bill gave us a foundation to come up with this  amendment.   Again, on a personal level, I want to especially thank the chair and  ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee. Senator Corker had  made a commitment to get this bill done after we got back from the  break. He has been good on his word, and we have a bipartisan  agreement.   I think these measures are necessary because the United States has  been attacked by a hostile foreign power. As a result, we have a  responsibility to respond in a way that punishes the attacker and that  strives to prevent a recurrence in the future.   In January, the Director of National Intelligence released a  declassified report on Russia's interference in our election. I think  it is important to reiterate what that report said. It states:         We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an       influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential       election. Russia's goals were to undermine faith in the US       democratic process.    While recently we have learned more about the scope of their  interference, a classified National Security Agency report, prepared  prior to the November election, concluded that Russian military  intelligence executed a cyber attack on at least one U.S. voting  software supplier and sent spear-fishing emails to more than 100 local  election officials. Yesterday, Bloomberg reported that Russia's cyber  attack on the U.S. electoral system included incursions into voter  databases and software systems in as many as 39 States.   We are learning more and more about the extent to which Russia  attacked our voting system and tried to undermine our elections. That  is exactly why the Senate stands united behind this bipartisan  amendment to stiffen sanctions. We must not allow this kind of  interference in our elections to become a normal process.   What we have heard from experts in the intelligence community--they  have warned us that if Russia gets a pass on this, that it will  interfere in future U.S. elections. We have seen it in Europe and other  Western democracies.   In testimony last month before the Judiciary Committee, the former  Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, said:         I believe [the Russians] are now emboldened to continue       such activities in the future both here and around the world,       and to do so even more intensely.    He goes on to say:         I hope the American people recognize the severity of this       threat and that we collectively counter it before it further       erodes the fabric of our democracy.    Russia's interference in our electoral process should outrage every  patriotic American. We need a bolder, more aggressive strategy for  deterring Russia. This bipartisan agreement to stiffen sanctions is a  critical step forward.   In concert with this legislation, we need to be focused on bolstering  NATO and our European allies, and we need to demonstrate more vigorous  support for Ukraine's efforts to strengthen its democracy and  independence.   We need to be more aggressive in countering the Russia propaganda and  disinformation campaign, including the Russia Today empire.   Finally, I want to again applaud the leadership of all of our  committees who were involved in coming up with this bipartisan  agreement. Also, I applaud the bipartisan leadership of Majority Leader  McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer because without their  negotiations, we would not be here today.   I certainly urge all of my colleagues in both Houses of Congress to  promptly approve this legislation, and I hope the President will sign  it.
