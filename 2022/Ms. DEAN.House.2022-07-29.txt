 Madam Speaker, as the summer session comes to a close, and  I return home to meet with folks from Cheltenham to Collegeville,  Pottstown to Boyertown, and everywhere in between, I am reflecting on  what work we have accomplished, work like my fire detectors bill that  will prevent tragedies, like the horrific fire we saw in Philadelphia  that claimed 12 lives, protecting people in public housing; or my  SECURE Notarization Act that will make it easier and faster to notarize  documents for families and military personnel abroad.   Democrats are putting people over politics. We passed major  protections for abortion, contraception, gay marriage, bills to prevent  price gouging and fight inflation, and the CHIPS and Science Act to  revitalize American manufacturing.   Next is our reconciliation bill that will deliver the largest  investment in American history to tackle climate change, healthcare,  drug pricing, and so much more.   Recognizing the humanity of our work, we are putting people over  power. We are putting people over politics.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I have four grandchildren. The youngest, Scottie, was  born just last year, in 2021. In Scottie's world, guns kill more kids  than cars do.                                time  1630    In Scottie's world there are 692 mass shootings every year, and when  she goes off to school, Scottie will learn her active shooter drills as  she learns to tie her shoes. We don't have to live like this if we all  only had the courage to pass the assault weapons ban to regulate  semiautomatic guns. Our gun violence crisis demands this and other  solutions. This will save lives.   Experts reveal that the casualties of mass shootings would have  dropped by 70 percent if the last assault weapons ban had stayed in  place.   How will I explain to Scottie that the other side boasts of 24  million assault-style weapons in the hands of Americans and says not  one word about the 24,000 people dead in just 7 months of this year  from guns?   We must act. Join me. Have the courage to join me. Pass the assault  weapons ban for Scottie's future and for all of our children.
