 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 888) expressing the hope for justice for the  victims of Bloody Sunday, one of the most tragic of days during the  Troubles, on its 50th anniversary as well as acknowledging the progress  made in fostering peace in Northern Ireland and on the island of  Ireland in recent decades, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 888         Whereas on January 30, 1972, 26 unarmed civilians were shot       by British soldiers during a protest that began peacefully in       Derry, resulting in the death of 14 individuals in a massacre       now known as Bloody Sunday;        Whereas as a result of the soldiers' unjustifiable use of       force, the individuals known as John ``Jackie'' Duddy,       Patrick ``Paddy'' Doherty, Bernard ``Barney'' McGuigan, Hugh       Gilmour, Kevin McElhinney, Michael Kelly, John Young, William       Nash, Michael McDaid, James Wray, Gerald Donaghy, Gerard       McKinney, William McKinney, and John Johnston tragically lost       their lives;        Whereas Bloody Sunday was one of the most significant and       deadly injustices to take place during the Troubles, and       exacerbated the conflict in Northern Ireland;        Whereas none of those shot by British Army soldiers posed a       threat of causing death or serious injury, or were doing       anything else that could justify their shooting;        Whereas the families of the victims of Bloody Sunday were       denied for decades an honest and comprehensive assessment of       the events that took place on Bloody Sunday;        Whereas in 1998, after campaigns from the families of those       injured and killed on Bloody Sunday, a second inquiry was       established by the Government of the United Kingdom;        Whereas this second Bloody Sunday Inquiry found that the       shootings that took place on Bloody Sunday were the result of       wrongful actions taken by British soldiers;        Whereas on June 15, 2010, then-Prime Minister David Cameron       while addressing the House of Commons apologized on behalf of       the Government of the United Kingdom saying that the events       that took place on Bloody Sunday were ``unjustified'',       ``unjustifiable'', and ``wrong'';        Whereas despite these findings and acknowledgment made by       the Government of the United Kingdom, none of the individuals       involved in the unlawful use of force that led to the murder       of 14 innocent civilians on Bloody Sunday have been held       accountable;        Whereas the lack of accountability and justice provided to       those who perished from the unlawful use of force on Bloody       Sunday both erodes trust and is dangerous;        Whereas accountability and justice for the victims of       Bloody Sunday, along with all victims of the Troubles, would       represent a step towards addressing Northern Ireland's legacy       of violence and promote reconciliation;        Whereas an environment which fosters accountability and       justice for the events of the Troubles must be established by       the Government of the United Kingdom and maintained;        Whereas the full implementation of the Good Friday       Agreement with a devolved government in Northern Ireland as       well as healthy ``north-south'' and ``east-west'' relations       provides appropriate, useful, and productive avenues for       discussion and negotiation to prevent violence, uphold peace,       maintain stability, and promote the interests of all parties       and communities involved;        Whereas the avoidance of a hard border on the island of       Ireland is essential for maintaining the peace resulting from       the Good Friday Agreement;        Whereas the full implementation of the Northern Ireland       Protocol as agreed upon as part of the United Kingdom's       withdrawal from the European Union will assist in preserving       peace and stability on the island of Ireland;        Whereas while progress has been made in fostering peace in       Northern Ireland and on the island of Ireland in recent       decades, it is in the interest of all parties to foster       intercommunity discussions and relations as well as       integration in civil and societal structures to promote       communication and mutual understanding; and        Whereas on January 30, 2022, peace activists, concerned       individuals, and the descendants of those lost to this       violence gathered in Derry to mourn, to stand in solidarity       with victims' families in their search for justice, and re-      commit themselves to the peace process established by the       Good Friday Agreement: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns the violence and killing of 14 individuals on       Bloody Sunday 50 years ago and supports justice for the       victims and their families;        (2) calls on all parties to take meaningful steps toward       peace and reconciliation and to ensure justice for victims of       the Bloody Sunday massacre as well as all those affected by       the Troubles by supporting dialogue and negotiation between       all parties;        (3) urges the full implementation of the Good Friday       Agreement to ensure peace and stability on the island of       Ireland;        (4) recognizes the findings of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry,       also known as the Saville Inquiry, and calls upon the       Government of the United Kingdom to support prosecutions of       individuals who committed unjustifiable crimes on Bloody       Sunday based on the evidence collected;        (5) opposes any proposal by the Government of the United       Kingdom to implement amnesty or statute of limitation laws       that would end or inhibit investigations and prosecutions of       crimes committed during the Troubles, including on Bloody       Sunday;        (6) calls upon the involved parties to facilitate the       implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol in the       interest of maintaining peace and stability on the island of       Ireland;        (7) urges the European Union, including the Republic of       Ireland, and the United Kingdom to act in good faith with       regard to negotiations around Brexit and implementation of       the Northern Ireland Protocol;        (8) calls on the people of Northern Ireland to foster       further integration across communities and break down       cultural, religious, and societal barriers that remain;        (9) supports the devolved government of Northern Ireland       and recognizes the devolved government as a successful       outcome and tenet of the Good Friday Agreement; and        (10) supports the continued strong governmental, societal,       and cultural relationships between the peoples of the United       States, the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland.   [[Page H3799]]      Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on H. Res. 888, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my resolution  expressing the hope for justice for the victims of Bloody Sunday, one  of the most tragic days of the Troubles, a violent time which lasted 30  years from approximately 1968 to 1998.   This resolution acknowledges the progress made in fostering peace on  the island of Ireland in recent decades and calls on all parties to  come together to ensure full implementation of the Good Friday  Agreement.   This resolution comes at an important time during the 50th-year  anniversary of the massacre and on St. Patrick's Day, a day where  people of Irish descent around the world remember our roots and  celebrate our history. I am proud the resolution is moving forward on  this day of all days.   First, I thank many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for  their sponsorship of this resolution. To the original cosponsors-- Representatives Richie Neal,   Mike Kelly, Brian Fitzpatrick,   David  Cicilline,  Jim McGovern, Nicole Malliotakis, Gerry Connolly, Juan  Vargas, and  Tom Suozzi--and almost 40 other cosponsors, I am grateful  for their support and for their longstanding work on this issue.   I also express my deepest gratitude to Chair Meeks, Ranking Member  McCaul, Leader Hoyer, and the House Foreign Affairs Committee staff for  their support of this resolution.   As a member and as a former chair of the Europe, Energy, the  Environment and Cyber Subcommittee himself, Chair Meeks understands  firsthand the importance of peace and stability on the island of  Ireland.   I introduced this resolution to honor the lives lost during Bloody  Sunday, a singular day amidst a long period of struggle that  exacerbated the conflict in Northern Ireland.   On January 30, 1972, I was a college student in Boston, a city known  for its deep connection to Irish-American culture. I vividly recall the  images and displays of unbridled violence during a peaceful protest in  Derry that reverberated throughout the world. Even today, I remain  deeply affected by the actions of British soldiers that led to the  wounding of 26 unarmed civilians and the death of 14 individuals.   On January 30, 2022, as 50 years had passed, I expressed to the  families of the victims my firm belief that Bloody Sunday represents  one of the deadliest injustices to take place during the Troubles. I  underline that as we continue to mourn the loss of those who perished  that day, we must also advocate for justice while taking the necessary  steps to build a more peaceful future.   As I expressed to the families, accountability and justice for the  events of Bloody Sunday must be achieved to ensure a long-lasting peace  on the island of Ireland. While it has long been acknowledged that  British soldiers were directly responsible for the murder of civilians  on Bloody Sunday, those who suffered under this unlawful use of force  continue to be denied an honest assessment of the events that took  place in 1972. To date, not one of the individuals involved has been  held accountable for their actions.   I want to state clearly: amnesty proposals by the government of the  United Kingdom are disrespectful and deny due process to Bloody Sunday  victims and their families. They run counter to the spirit of remarks  of then-Prime Minister David Cameron who termed the events as  unjustifiable and wrong. The evidence is clear: The individuals  responsible for the violence that took place on that fateful day must  be brought to justice.   Along with the avoidance of a hard border, these legacy issues remain  as threats to and unfinished business of the Good Friday Agreement, an  agreement few thought would ever occur. Both sides compromised. Its  improbable success of diplomacy over violence inspires us today as  Europe and the world face its greatest conflict in 80 years.   On St. Patrick's Day we take pride in the indispensable role the  United States has played in forging the Good Friday Agreement. The  Clinton Administration and congressional leaders worked tirelessly over  two decades ago to implement the Good Friday Agreement and achieve  peace through diplomacy. I admire the efforts of American leaders like  Tip O'Neill; Ted Kennedy; George Mitchell; and my colleague, Richie  Neal, who were all instrumental in negotiating a long-lasting peace.   I firmly believe the agreement accompanied by the efforts of  community activists and leaders willing to work for peace and commit to  a political framework was and remains essential to creating stability  in the region. We must continue to support the ongoing efforts to  promote integration and reconciliation and address the impacts of  intergenerational trauma.   Leaders like Monica McWilliams and Jane Morrice, as well as countless  others working on these issues today, recognize that peace does not  begin and end only on Good Friday. The work they do and the work of  others healed divided communities and should and must go on.   This resolution not only remembers those who lost their lives during  the Troubles but also recognizes challenges and opportunities of  maintaining the hard-fought peace that followed. Let Bloody Sunday  serve as a reminder of the hard work and pain to achieve harmony.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania  for his support and for his bipartisan efforts at healing and moving  forward.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle), who is a friend of Ireland and a friend of  mine. He is a champion of civil rights causes.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), a champion of the Good Friday Agreement, a  person who I mentioned in my remarks was there at the time, working to  make it successful. Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement have no  greater leader and supporter.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a champion of civil rights here in this  country, a civil rights movement in this country that helped inspire  the Good Friday Agreement.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague on the Foreign Affairs Committee,  Representative Meuser, for his very eloquent remarks and his bipartisan  support and leadership on this issue for Ireland.   I want to record and reflect upon the people lost during these tragic  events marked by Bloody Sunday. They are John ``Jack'' Duddy, Patrick  ``Paddy'' Doherty, Bernard ``Barney'' McGuigan, Hugh Gilmour, Kevin  McElhinney, Michael Kelly, John Young, William Nash, Michael McDaid,  James Wray, Gerald Donaghy, Gerard McKinney, William McKinney, and John  Johnston.   We need to remember and memorialize these people, young and old, who  stood peacefully, and in defiance, in their support for their values.   While many, rightfully so, have been commended for their work to  bring peace to the island of Ireland, the victims of the Bloody Sunday  massacre made the ultimate sacrifice, fighting against repression and  demanding peace.  [[Page H3802]]    To the victims of Bloody Sunday; all victims of The Troubles,  including the disappeared; the families of the victims; and the people  of Ireland and Northern Ireland, I say this directly to you: We, in  Congress, remember. We, in Congress, stand with you. We, in Congress,  know there is much more work still to be done.   I introduced this resolution to demonstrate our solidarity with you,  and I urge passage to signal that we will continue to fight for peace  and stability on the island of Ireland.   With that spirit, I wish you all a happy St. Patrick's Day, and I  urge all of my colleagues to join us by voting in the affirmative on  this important resolution.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
