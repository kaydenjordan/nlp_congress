 I do not. Thank you.   * * * *. Ms. Lofgren, anything?    Madam Speaker, Mark Meadows was served with a subpoena  for testimony and documents 3 months ago. Since that time, he has done  TV interviews, published a book, and produced over 9,000 documents  about January 6, which he concedes are not covered by any form of  privilege.   These documents include chilling text messages from the President's  son, Don, Jr., urging Meadows to get his father to do something to stop  the violence; from Members of Congress, urging that the Vice President  simply ignore electoral votes he personally deems unconstitutional;  and, even after the violence of January 6, bemoaning the fact that the  effort to overturn the counting of the electors was a failure.   One of the texts to Meadows, on January 3, came from an unknown  caller and referred to efforts to replace the leadership of the  Department of Justice and said the following: ``I heard Jeff Clark is  getting put in on Monday. That's amazing. It will make a lot of  patriots happy, and I'm personally so proud that you are at the tip of  the spear and I can call you a friend.''   But notwithstanding his texts, his emails, his interviews, and his  book, Mr. Meadows refused to appear for his deposition, claiming that  to discuss the same issues, documents, and book is somehow privileged.  The inconsistency, the hypocrisy, grabs you by the neck, and so does  his utter contempt of Congress.   Mr. Meadows is a central participant and witness to the events of  January 6. He is at the tip of the spear. If he can get away with  ignoring the law, if witnesses summoned before Congress can merely pick  and choose when they comply, our power of oversight will be gone and  along with it our cherished system of checks and balances.   Take away Congress' power to compel evidence and you take away  Congress' power to protect the public from a dangerous and malign  executive. People died on January 6. A Congress that cannot enforce its  subpoenas in such an investigation is no more effective than a court in  a homicide case which cannot compel witnesses to appear. We would cease  to be a Congress and become a mere plaything in the hands of a despot.   Mark Meadows has demonstrated contempt for Congress and for the  public. Now, he must be held in contempt. He should be prosecuted like  anyone else who ignores the law because no one is above the law.                                time  1745
