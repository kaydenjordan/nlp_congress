 Mr. Speaker, I strongly support Chairwoman Eshoo's  bill to create an Advanced Research Projects Agency. This bill will  ensure that ARPA-H can address the limitations of commercial markets  and tackle high-risk, high-reward biomedical research in oncology,  neuroscience, diabetes, artificial intelligence, mRNA and RNA, cell and  gene therapy, and so much more.   As the global epicenter of breakthrough science, Massachusetts is a  top candidate to host the headquarters of ARPA-H. Not only are we home  to the highest proportion of top-ranked research universities in the  world, but we also have the best and brightest in industry, healthcare,  and academia.   We have also invested in infrastructure to support the needs of ARPA- H. Over the past decade, we have delivered 21.6 million square feet of  lab space, in addition to over 100 incubators, accelerators, and co- working spaces.   This bill specifically directs ARPA-H to advance early disease  detection, translational research, and health technologies. It realizes  President Biden's goal of driving breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer's,  diabetes, and infectious disease. From pre-competitive Alzheimer's  research at the Massachusetts General Hospital to Vertex's work to  utilize stem cell therapies to treat diabetes, we are aligned with and  deeply committed to ARPA-H's goal in the Commonwealth.   I am proud to represent a State that is deeply invested in the  success of ARPA-H.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
