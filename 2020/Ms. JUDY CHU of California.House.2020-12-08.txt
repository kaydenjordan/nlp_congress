 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  the ALS Disability Insurance Access Act, which would help those  diagnosed with ALS get their benefits quickly by making them eligible  to receive Social Security Disability Insurance immediately instead of  having to wait 5 months.   I have heard heart-wrenching stories from my constituents whose lives  have been upended by this cruel and aggressive disease. ALS is a  progressive neurodegenerative disease over the course of which those  with ALS lose the ability to initiate and control muscle movement. This  leads to paralysis and, ultimately, death.   Tragically, ALS has a fatality rate of 100 percent. Unfortunately,  this disease is so aggressive and can take so long to diagnose that  some patients lose their battle with ALS before the 5-month waiting  period for SSDI benefits is over. This bill would ensure that those who  have an ALS diagnosis are not denied their benefits when they need them  most.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of the House version of this  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill before us  today.
