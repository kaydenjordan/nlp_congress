 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott from Virginia for  his kind words and leadership, and I want to commend Congresswoman  Susan Davis from California for leading on this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8294, the National  Apprenticeship Act, and to urge my colleagues to support my amendment,  which would ensure equity and fairness in our national apprenticeship  system.   Specifically, my amendment would support the recruitment, retention,  and completion of nontraditional apprenticeship populations, including  women, people of color, and individuals with barriers to employment.   Now more than ever, in response to the economic challenges posed by  COVID-19, people need access to opportunities in apprenticeships. This  is especially true for my constituents throughout Nevada, which has  been one of the hardest hit economic regions in the country.    My amendment would ensure that women like Evelyn Pacheco, who is the  founder and president of Nevada Women in Trades, continue to have  opportunities to provide apprenticeships to women of color throughout  southern Nevada. The opportunities presented by women like Evelyn  matter because 94 percent of apprentices who complete an apprenticeship  program retain employment with an average annual salary of $70,000.   Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that this pandemic has  disproportionately impacted workers of color, particularly women of  color, who have shouldered the greatest job losses due to their  concentration in low-wage service industries that have been hardest hit  by the economic downturn.   That is why we must do everything in our power to ensure that we have  equity and fairness in our national apprenticeship system so that every  person can have access and support for desperately needed job training.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of my  amendment, and I support the passage of H.R. 8294.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Congressional Record a letter from the  National Urban League supporting my amendment and the National  Apprenticeship Act of 2020.                                          National Urban League,                                                  November 19, 2020.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the National Urban League       and its 90 affiliates located in 36 states and the District       of Columbia, I urge you to vote ``Yes'' on the National       Registered Apprenticeship Act (NAA) and associated equity       amendments, including those put forth by Representatives       Brown, Horsford, Moore, Ryan/Rice and Smith/Langevin.        The COVID-19 pandemic has shuttered businesses all across       America, leaving millions of workers unemployed and devasting       our national economy. Research shows that Black and Latino       workers are more likely to be working in hard-hit industries       that may never bounce back. The NAA represents an important       step towards stemming that job loss by creating one million       new apprenticeship opportunities over the next five years, in       addition to the opportunities that are already being created.       These apprenticeships result in substantially higher earnings       compared to nonparticipants. By some accounts, the average       starting salary of an apprentice is $70,000, a family-      sustaining middle-class income.        Yet, more work is needed to ensure equitable access to       apprenticeship opportunities to nontraditional populations,       including people of color and women, as apprenticeship       programs are often less diverse than the occupations they       ultimately serve. According to the Department of Labor's       (DOL) Equal Employment Opportunity study, African Americans       represented only 10% of registered apprentices and are the       most underpaid compared to other ethnic groups. Across 25       states in which DOL tracks registered apprenticeships, the       data show the opportunities are dominated by white men.        The National Urban League has worked to advance economic       opportunity for African Americans and other underserved       communities for more than 110 years. Our job training       programs target workers with multiple barriers to employment       to help them secure full-time jobs and career advancement       opportunities. Through DOL's Equity in Apprenticeship       program, the National Urban League and eleven affiliates have       increased opportunities in nontraditional fields through pre-      apprenticeship and registered apprenticeships to more than       1,200 African American and other nontraditional populations.        The National Urban League urges you to support the National       Registered Apprenticeship Act and accompanying equity       amendments to ensure nontraditional populations have access       to the support they need to thrive and businesses have the       skilled workforce they need to succeed in this uncertain       economy.            Sincerely,                                                 Marc H. Morial,                                                  President and CEO,                                             National Urban League.
