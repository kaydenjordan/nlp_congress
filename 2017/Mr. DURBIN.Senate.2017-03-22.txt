 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last Thursday was a sunny, cold day in  Chicago, but I looked forward to it because there was an event that I  wouldn't miss. We have a hospital there known as the Rehab Institute of  Chicago. It is one of my favorites, and we have some great hospitals.  The Rehab Institute of Chicago literally focuses on people who have had  serious accidents, strokes, injuries and who are trying to get  rehabilitated so they can function and walk.   I really got to know this hospital years ago when I had a town  meeting in Chicago and talked about our returning veterans from Iraq  and Afghanistan. Many of them were coming home with serious injuries  from roadside bombs and the types of injuries that can change your  life.   A man came up to me, and his name was Ed Edmundson. He was from North  Carolina. I was kind of surprised that he was at a Chicago town  meeting. He explained to me that he heard about the town meeting  because he had a son named Eric who was a disabled veteran and was at  the Rehab Institute of Chicago. It turns out that Eric was seriously  wounded by a roadside bomb in Iraq, and during the course of the  surgery afterward, there was an accident. The net result of it was that  he had very limited mobility and he could no longer speak.   Eric, if I remember, was about 23 years old. He was married and the  father of a little girl. Well, the VA did the best for him, and they  finally came to his mom and dad and said: We can't do anything more. We  need you to pick out a motorized wheelchair for Eric because he needs  to be in a nursing home. His father said: He is 23 years old. He is not  going to a nursing home. We are not quitting. His dad then set out to  find the best hospital in the United States and came to the conclusion  that the Rehab Institute of Chicago was the place.   So he came to invite me to come up and meet Eric at the hospital,  which I did a couple of days later. Eric was there with his mom and  dad, and he started the rehab. I went back to see him a week or so  later to see how he was doing. His mom said, as I came into the room:  Eric has a gift for you. I thought: A gift for me? The gift was that  Eric, with a little help, was able to stand on his own feet. It was a  breakthrough. Some people had said it would never happen again.   His dad said to me that Eric planned on Memorial Day to put on his  full dress uniform from the Army and walk out of the front door of that  hospital with a little help and show folks that they shouldn't have  given up on him. They asked me if I could be there. I said: I will move  Heaven and Earth; I will be there. I wasn't the only one. There were a  lot of people there--the mayor, elected officials, and every TV camera  in Chicago--as Eric Edmundson walked out of the front door of the Rehab  Institute in Chicago.   You never forget those moments, do you? Here is a young man who  risked his life for America, came back gravely injured, and through his  father and mother's determination--and his own strength--he found the  best place for treatment. This rehab institute does research to find  ways that give people who have spinal injuries and other injuries  another chance.   Well, last Thursday they opened up the new Rehab Institute of  Chicago, and it is renamed. It is the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. It is  not a hospital. They call it an AbilityLab, and the reason is that they  try to integrate research with actual doctors, clinicians, and patients  all in the same place--not separate universities and hospitals and so  forth. It is a bold idea. It is a new concept, but if anybody can pull  it off, it is Dr. Joanne Smith, who heads up now the Shirley Ryan  AbilityLab.   Do you know what I learned as I got out of the car to give the speech  and to cut the ribbon at this new research facility? I learned that the  President of the United States, Donald Trump, had just announced his  new budget. Do you know what was included in his new budget? A new  spending line for the National Institutes of Health. That agency is the  premier medical research agency in the world, and we are lucky to have  it right here in the United States. We are lucky that Congress has  given more money to NIH for biomedical research last year. Senator  Blunt, a Republican of Missouri, who heads up the subcommittee with  Senator Murray of Washington, planned on giving more this year, and we  are still trying.   Do you know what President Trump suggested for next year's budget for  the National Institutes of Health? He suggested cutting their  appropriation by $5.8 billion. It is a $32 billion appropriation.  Cutting it by $5.8 billion will bring the level of biomedical research  in the United States of America down to the lowest point it has been in  16 years. That is President Trump's idea of a priority--the most  dramatic cut in biomedical research in the last 16 years.    I announced it when I did the ribbon-cutting speech. First, I thanked  all the folks at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, Dr. Smith, and Shirley  and Pat Ryan. I told them if there is ever a time both political  parties ought to come together and tell this President that you are  just flat-out wrong, this is it. This is it because the medical  research that is taking place in the National Institutes of Health is  not just for those who are sick today but for those who may be  diagnosed later today or tomorrow.   You know what the most frequently asked questions will be when you  get that heartbreaking diagnosis? Doctor, is there anything you can do  for me? Is there a medicine? Is there a procedure? Basically, is there  any hope? If the NIH, or the National Institutes of Health, isn't  properly funded and isn't doing its job, that answer is not always  going to be a good one.   Young medical researchers don't get rich, but they love what they do.  To keep them on the job doing what they should do with all of their  talent and  [[Page S1920]]  all of their skill and all of their education, we have to promise them  that we are going to continue to fund medical research in a serious  way, without the peaks and valleys.   President Donald Trump does not understand that. Mick Mulvaney, head  of the Office of Management and Budget, who came up with this terrible  budget, doesn't understand that. To them, they are just numbers on a  page. We will just cut biomedical research to the lowest level in 16  years.   A few minutes ago I had a visit from some folks from Chicago, IL.  They were with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. They come to  see me each year. You will see them around the halls wearing their  orange ties and orange scarves. They came to talk about multiple  sclerosis, which for many of my close friends is a disabling disease  they fight every day. It is a disease of the central nervous system. It  interrupts the flow of information within the brain and between the  brain and the body. Symptoms range from numbness to tingling, to  blindness and paralysis. The progress, severity, and specific symptoms  of MS of any one person can't be predicted.   The good news is that we are engaged in research that can make a  difference, research that gives us hope. They talked to me about Donald  Trump's cuts to the National Institutes of Health. I told them I was  going to do everything in my power to restore that money so that the  research continues.   Incidentally, there is another issue. It isn't just fighting the  disease and doing the research. It is what is happening to the cost of  the drugs that these people need to maintain their lives and that give  them hope. In 2004 the average wholesale price of available MS disease- modifying therapies was $16,000. By 2013, the average price had gone up  to $61,000. In 2017, the average price is up to $83,600. All of the top  10 specialty medication classes, which include MS, increased in  spending, and all had increases in the price of medication. Some of  these drugs have been on the market for years, and now the  pharmaceutical industry is driving the costs up across the board.   When we talk about healthcare in America, it is interesting how  little time we spend talking about the cost of pharmaceuticals. But how  wrong we are. When the head of Blue Cross in Chicago came to see me,  she said: Senator, I will bet you didn't know last year Blue Cross Blue  Shield spent more money in their hospitalization plans for  pharmaceuticals and medications than they spent for inpatient hospital  care for those who were covered--more money on drugs than inpatient  hospital care.   So what did the Affordable Care Act, which is being debated, do about  the price of pharmaceuticals? Almost nothing. What does the new  Republican replacement plan do about the cost of pharmaceuticals?  Almost nothing. Why? Why is there this hands-off attitude when it comes  to an integral part of the cost of healthcare and an integral factor in  the dramatic increases in the cost of healthcare? Because pharma has  friends in high places.   Watch your television sets. There are two things to watch for, if you  still watch television. The first thing is to watch for all the drugs  that are advertised on television. Do you know how many countries in  the world allow drugs to be advertised on television? Two. And one of  them is the United States.   You see all these drugs being advertised that are going to allow you  to be liberated, freed, and cured, and this and that and the other  thing. Then, they run through all the disclaimers. This is the one I  like the best: Be sure and tell your doctor if you have had a liver  transplant: Oh, Doc, did I fail to mention I had a liver transplant?   That is the kind of thing they put on television. Why does a  pharmaceutical company spend all that money advertising on television?  They make money off of it.   Here is how. Americans walk into their doctor's office and say: I  just saw this ad for this drug, and I think it is exactly what I need.  Too many doctors, instead of taking 10 minutes to explain why it isn't  the drug you need, take 1 minute to write out the script. So expensive  drugs make it on the market and justify the advertising on television.  That is one of the grim realities of what we are facing.   When it comes to the drugs and their pricing, we know what is  happening. They are running up the costs of drugs on individuals, and  they can't afford it any more. I just met with some of these MS  patients, and one of them told me she had gone now for weeks without  medication because, she said: Senator, it is $6,000 I just don't have.   Well, we can do better than that. We should do better than that as a  nation. We ought to make certain that we don't get swept away with the  pharmaceutical companies and their advertising. Those are the other  things you are going to see on television now. They are really  beautifully done ads. They are talking about all of us wanting to  survive and how the pharmaceutical industries are finding, through  their research, good drugs to help us survive. I don't quarrel with  that premise. That is right, but it turns out many of them are spending  more money on advertising than they are on research. So this is big  business. It is big profits. They are trying to protect them. It is  driving up the cost of healthcare. People like my friends with multiple  sclerosis are wondering how this will end and whether they will be able  to pay for the treatment they desperately need.    If this means anything to those who are listening to this debate, if  it means something to you or your family, you need to speak up-- Democrat, Republican, Independent, Trump voter or not--you need to let  this administration and this Congress know that medical research is a  priority to you. If it is not, hold on tight because Donald Trump's  budget is about to rip the heart out of the National Institutes of  Health.   Whatever his ambition, whatever his goals, whatever his tweets, I  could care less. When it comes to medical research, he is in for a  fight.                                  TrumpCare    Mr. President, the Republicans promised, if they took a majority, the  first thing they would do is get rid of ObamaCare. He is gone. It has  to be gone too. Fifty-seven times--maybe more--in the House of  Representatives, they voted to abolish ObamaCare. It didn't mean  anything. He was still President then. He was going to veto whatever  they passed, but they did it over and over and over. It was an article  of faith, and they beat their chests and went across America saying:  Get rid of ObamaCare.   Then the dog caught the bus. They got the majority in the House and  the Senate, and all of those threats and promises about ObamaCare  became reality. Then something else happened. People started saying to  the Republican majority: And then what? What are you going to replace  it with?   Well, it turns out for 6 years they have been writing speeches about  abolishing ObamaCare instead of for 6 years writing plans and bills to  replace it. So they slapped together a replacement plan, sent it over-- I say that because it only took them a couple of weeks. They sent it  over to the Congressional Budget Office, which is kind of like the  umpire here, the referee, to take a look at it.   The Congressional Budget Office gave a report on the Republican  replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act. This is what it said:  Under TrumpCare--ObamaCare to TrumpCare--under TrumpCare, 24 million  Americans will lose their health insurance; 14 million in the first  year--24 million Americans out of a nation of what, 350 million, 360  million. That is a pretty large group.   We know what happens when people lose their health insurance. They  still get sick. When they get sick, they go to the emergency room when  it is too bad, and the emergency room takes care of them. Then the  hospital, because the person does not have health insurance, chalks up  the cost of that health to charity care and passes it along to everyone  else with health insurance.   Under TrumpCare, seniors, rural communities, and lower and middle- income families will see their premiums and out-of-pocket costs soar,  according to the Congressional Budget Office. Under TrumpCare,  Medicare's solvency will shrink by 4 years. Medicare, you remember, is  the program primarily for seniors started back in the 1960s to make  sure that when you got to a point in life, age 65, you may not be  working, no longer have insurance through your  [[Page S1921]]  employer, the government Medicare plan would cover you.   Has it worked? Ask 60 million Americans who count on it. Yes. What  about the results? Since the 1960s, people are living longer. We know  Medicare works, but the cost of healthcare has been going up, and we  worried about its long-term solvency. It turns out the Affordable Care  Act, which we passed, brought some savings to healthcare and added 10  years of solvency to Medicare.   Now, the Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and it  will reduce the solvency of Medicare by 4 years--4 years sooner  Medicare will go insolvent. The fiscally conservative Republican Party  has come up with an answer, which leads to sooner insolvency for  Medicare. Under TrumpCare, $880 billion in Federal Medicaid funding to  States will be eliminated. What does it mean? Well, let me tell you the  story of Judy.   Judy works at a motel in Southern Illinois. She is in her sixties.  She is a hard-working lady. There is not a lazy bone in her body. She  works in the hospitality room where you get the free breakfast at the  motel. She is the one who smiles and cleans off the table and makes  sure you are happy. I got to know her. Judy asked me about all of this  stuff going on with affordable care. I asked her: Would you mind  working with my office? Let's see what we can do for you.   It turns out that Judy, as hard as she works, makes a very low  income. She qualified for Medicaid, which meant health insurance that  did not cost her anything because her income was so low. She couldn't  believe it. For the first time in her life--for the first time in her  life she had health insurance--Medicaid--providing her health  insurance. It was a good thing too because just shortly afterward she  was diagnosed with diabetes. Now comes the proposal from the  Republicans to remove so many people across America from Medicaid.  Where does that leave Judy? Back where she started, working hard, with  diabetes, a low income, and no health insurance. Terrible things can  happen to you if you have diabetes and don't have some medical home or  a doctor you can count on.   That is the reality of what TrumpCare will mean to Judy in Southern  Illinois. One trillion dollars will be cut from programs that serve  low- and middle-class families so the Republican approach can cut taxes  for the wealthiest people in America. I am not making that up.   They are raising the premiums for working families to pay. They are  cutting off seniors and others from Medicaid coverage so they can give  tax breaks to the wealthiest superrich in America. It is going to cost  us healthcare jobs across America. Downstate Illinois, those are good- paying jobs. The Illinois Hospital Association says we are going to  lose them.    This Republican bill, TrumpCare, is bad for seniors, bad for middle- class families, bad for people with disabilities. It is not very good  for kids. Half of the kids in America are born under and taken care of  by Medicaid. It is bad for the States, bad for just about everyone who  is not healthy or wealthy. Yet the House Republican leadership is  intent on moving forward with TrumpCare this week.   The President came to the House Republicans yesterday and said: If  you don't support me on this vote, I am coming after your districts to  defeat you.   This approach is going to increase premiums for seniors in one of the  most fundamental ways. We said in our bill that we voted for that you  could not have a disparity in premiums more than 3 to 1. So the  premiums charged to a 20-year-old and the premiums charged to a 60- year-old could be no different than a 3-to-1 margin. The Republicans  changed that and made it 5 to 1.   That is why the American Association of Retired Persons opposes  TrumpCare and why seniors across the country are waking up to the  reality that they are in for a jolt when it comes to the premiums they  have to pay.   Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican, has said: ``This is not  a bill I could support in its current form . . . it really misses the  mark.'' As Senator Collins noted, this bill does not come close to  achieving the goal of allowing low-income seniors to purchase health  insurance.   Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana, said:         The CBO score was, shall we say, an eye-popper. . . . Can't       sugarcoat it. . . . Doesn't look good.    Senator and Dr. Cassidy, Republican from Louisiana, said that. He  went on to say:         That's not what President Trump promised. . . . That's not       what the Republicans ran on.    Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, said:         I'm afraid that if [House Republicans] vote for this bill,       they're going to put the House majority at risk next year. .       . . Just from a practical standpoint, I don't think this bill       is going to reduce premiums for working Americans. . . . I       think it's going to cost coverage for many Americans.    Why do we want to rush this process? It took us more than 2 years to  write a bill, and it is still a bill that needs more work. I voted for  it. To think that they can replace it in a matter of weeks, with this  slap-dash approach, is not fair to America. It is not fair to people  who count on health insurance for peace of mind and coverage when they  desperately need it.   I see my friend on the floor. I am going to close. I released a  report today, and it is one I am going to share across the board in  Illinois before our delegation votes this week. This bill in Illinois  means that 311,000 people I represent would lose their private health  insurance. By 2020, the average enrollee in Illinois would see their  health insurance costs increase by over $3,000--by 2026, almost $5,000.   The impact is particularly severe for Illinoisans ages 55 to 64. They  would see their costs of premiums increase by over 50 percent. Illinois  hospitals, they are against it too. They know that a lot of downstate  hospitals and inner-city hospitals can't survive this Republican  replacement plan.   I will close with a letter from Christine McTaggart of Watseka, IL.  Here is what she said to me: ``I wake up every day since the election  fearing that a complete repeal will happen and for me that translates  into a death sentence.''   Christine was originally diagnosed with stage IIIb inflammatory  breast cancer in September of 2012. Given this type of aggressive  cancer, her prognosis was poor. She went through 16 cycles--16--of  chemotherapy, a bilateral mastectomy, 33 radiation treatments, failed  reconstruction and chronic tissue issues, and thyroid cancer as well.   After all of that, in 2014, she learned her breast cancer was back.  This time in her bones, stage IV. In her letter to me, Christine  McTaggart of Watseka wrote:         When the Affordable Care Act became law, I had no idea my       life would come to depend on policies such as pre-existing       conditions not excluding you from coverage . . . and lifetime       maximums being eliminated. If ACA were repealed, I would no       longer have coverage as my chronic ongoing treatment has far       exceeded the old lifetime maximums. . . . I would have to       choose between bankruptcy for treatments I cannot afford and       rolling the dice, waiting for death.    She ends with this:         I thank you for your tireless advocacy on this issue. . . .       My life literally depends on it.    What we need to do is take repeal off the table, and this Senator  will pull a chair up to the table. Let's make the Affordable Care Act  work. Let's do it in a bipartisan way. Let's not look for a slam dunk  for either political party. Let's try to do the right thing for  America. We are not going to make the extremes in either political  party happy, but if millions of Americans have health insurance and can  find a way to pay for it, then we will do our job.   I yield the floor.
