 Mr. Speaker, as many of you know, we have had a Russian  narrative that has been going on because of an infamous dossier. While  there has been much reported on it, I can tell you that the  Intelligence Committee has been fast at work, and Chairman Nunes has  been doing outstanding work to get to the truth for the American  people.   Today, I had the opportunity to go into a confidential setting to  make sure that what we can do is understand better what actually took  place. I am here to tell all of America tonight that I am shocked to  read exactly what has taken place. I would think that it would never  happen in a country that loves freedom and democracy like this country.   It is time that we become transparent in all of this. I am calling on  our leadership to make this available so that all Americans can judge  for themselves.                            ____________________
