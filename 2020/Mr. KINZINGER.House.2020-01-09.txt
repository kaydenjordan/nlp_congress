 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Sometimes when I watch the debate, I wonder what happened to the  confident America that I remember; that when a failing country  threatens us, we actually respond with force instead of fear and run  away.   That said, this process argument that we are having is interesting,  but as my colleague said earlier, maybe they forgot something.   So I am going to urge defeat of the previous question, because I  think in this resolution, something major was forgotten, maybe they can  re-craft it, bring it back later, but that is this: I hear my friends  on the other side of the aisle say that Mr. Soleimani was a bad guy and  they are glad he is dead. However--process argument follows--I think  something has been left out of this.   When I was in Iraq in 2008 and 2009, I operated mostly against  terrorist networks of a different nature, but about a quarter of my  operations were against terrorist networks from Mr. Soleimani.   So these attacks against Americans, we talked about the dead  Americans from Iraq, these have been going on for a very long time, and  I was part of the response to that.   One of the most important things we can do, if we are going to have  this process argument, is appreciate the men and women, not just of the  military, but of the intelligence community, of the State Department,  of everywhere that has worked to bring the intelligence to bring this  evil man to justice.   I heard somebody earlier say we should have just captured him. Well,  think of the risk that would have put to our military. So maybe we  should at least appreciate the job that they are willing to do. That is  going to be essential.   I often hear my friends talk about keeping the military safe, as if  that is the end state of the military.   The military's job that they volunteer for every day is to keep the  American people safe, and that is exactly what was done a week ago in  the death of Soleimani.   So, Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous  question so that we can give them an opportunity and pass this  resolution appreciating the men and women of the intelligence community  and the military. That is the least we can do after this debate on the  floor.                                time  1330
