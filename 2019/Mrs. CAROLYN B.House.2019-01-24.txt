 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, it is time to end  this shutdown, which is hurting working Americans and damaging the  overall economy.   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says that the shutdown is harming the  American people, American business, and the economy.   So far, it has cost the United States economy about a half percentage  point of overall economic growth. That is about $25 billion.   JPMorgan Chase estimates that the shutdown is now reducing economic  output up to $10 billion each week.   Even the administration has doubled its estimate of the economic  cost. It says that, if the shutdown lasts through March, we could have  zero growth this quarter. Some forecasters even project that growth  could turn negative.   Mr. President, open this government for the people. The people are  hurting. Enough is enough.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York (for herself,               Mrs. Wagner, and Mr. Cohen):        H.R. 777.
