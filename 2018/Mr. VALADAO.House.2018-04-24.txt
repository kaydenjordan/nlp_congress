 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember those lives lost  in the Armenian Genocide more than 100 years ago. From 1915 to 1923,  the Ottoman Empire engaged in the systematic and organized deportation  and extermination of over 2 million men, women, and children from  Armenia. Today, these horrific events have become known as the Armenian  Genocide.   Many of those able to flee immigrated to the United States and  settled in the Central Valley of California. Today, their families  continue to grow, thrive, and pass along their cultural heritage into  their adopted communities.   The sense of loss as a result of these horrific acts runs deep, as  many Armenian Americans personally know a friend or family member who  was unable to escape the genocide. As a result, the Armenians  throughout the United States have been steadfast in their efforts to  continue to ensure the memory of those lost never fades.   Despite the horrors of this time and broad international consensus  that these events are rightfully identified as ``genocide,'' the  foreign policy of the United States refuses to acknowledge what so many  already know to be true.   As co-chair of the Congressional Armenian Caucus, I ask my colleagues  in the House of Representatives to stand with me in recognizing and  remembering the 2 million lives who were lost or forever changed by  these tragic events.                            ____________________
