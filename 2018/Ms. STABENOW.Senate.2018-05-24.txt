 Mr. President, today I wish to pay special  tribute to the American Legion Department of Michigan, which this year  is celebrating its 100th convention.   When the American Legion was chartered by Congress 1919, its members  were veterans of what was termed the War to End All Wars: World War I.  They served alongside people like John F. Roehl, a former major in the  Air Service and chief inspector for the Detroit Department of Health,  first commander of American Legion Post 1 in Warren; Captain James  Wilson, who was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and received a  citation for bravery in action from General John Pershing, first  commander of Post 36 in Kalamazoo; and Lilly Larson of Ishpeming, who  served in the U.S. Army Nurse Corps and today is the namesake of  American Legion Post 114 in Greenwood.   Today's American Legion members have served on many fronts and in  many capacities. However, they share a few key attributes with the  American Legion's very first members. They all have a deep and profound  love for this country. They all have served in uniform with honor, and  they all are dedicated to continuing to serve their communities, their  country, and their fellow veterans.   They do this in as many ways as there are American Legion posts in  big cities, small towns, and rural areas across Michigan and across  this country.   Post 44 in Marquette sponsors a youth hockey team, which gives area  young people a chance to stay active and involved during those months  when the snow is a bit too deep in the Upper Peninsula to play American  Legion baseball.   Post 459 in Grand Rapids teams up with organizations including the  Children's Advocacy Center of Kent County to raise funds to support  children who are victims of abuse and to build communities where all  young people are respected and safe.   Post 202 in Detroit has a strong focus on connecting young people in  southeast Michigan with educational and service opportunities,  including Boys State, Student Trooper, JROTC, and college scholarships.   Post 68 in Paw Paw hosts an ``All Gave Some . . . Some Gave All''  golf outing to raise money for items like Trackchairs, so that wounded  Michigan warriors can continue to enjoy the active, offroad life so  many people in our State enjoy.   Whether they are finding housing for homeless veterans, connecting  separating servicemembers with employment opportunities, supporting  military families, or inspiring the next generation of patriots, every  day, American Legion members are doing all they can to build stronger  communities and a stronger country.   Their hard work and dedication is a testament to their organization  and to the values that have been the foundation of the American Legion  from the beginning: love of country, respect for continued service,  promotion of a strong national defense, and devotion to their fellow  servicemembers and veterans.   For a century, the American Legion has made sure that the voices of  our veterans are heard and their service and sacrifice have not been  forgotten. On its 100th anniversary, it is my honor to do the same for  them.   Thank you.                            ____________________
