 Mr. Speaker, hypocrisy and irresponsibility are alive and  well today in this Chamber.   At the same time Nancy Pelosi is calling for oversight of the $3  trillion we have already spent, she is bringing up a reckless bill to  spend $3 trillion more.   Much of this bill has nothing to do with COVID-19. Instead, this bill  is a radical Democrat wish list: permanent mail-in voting, amnesty and  stimulus checks for illegal immigrants, and more incentives for  Americans not to work.   Across America, citizens are coming together to help their friends  and neighbors. For all its faults, Congress did come together in a  bipartisan way to pass numerous measures to fight this pandemic. But  Speaker Pelosi has broken that spirit of cooperation. In choosing to  play partisan politics and go at this one alone, she has set a terrible  example for a nation in crisis. Instead of pausing the spending to  evaluate our needs and engage with President Trump and the Senate, we  are here today simply to appease the fringe elements of the Democratic  Party.
