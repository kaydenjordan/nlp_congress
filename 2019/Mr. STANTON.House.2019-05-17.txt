 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5, the Equality Act. I  want to thank my friend and fellow recovering mayor, Congressman  Cicilline, for his strong and unwavering leadership on this historic  civil rights legislation.   When it comes to equality, there is no doubt that we have come a long  way. But following the landmark Supreme Court ruling that legalized gay  marriage in all 50 States, the hard truth is that discrimination based  on sexual orientation is still permitted under the law.   LGBTQ individuals face this reality every day--that they may receive  different, unfair treatment in employment, housing, public  accommodations, public education, and more. We are better than that. We  are a nation that believes all are created equal, that this truth is  self-evident.   I rise today in fervent support of the Equality Act because everyone  should be treated equally no matter who they are, whom they love, or  how they express themselves. Whether you are in Phoenix or  Philadelphia, Mesa or Montgomery, you deserve to be seen, to be heard,  and to be welcomed.
