 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to reflect  on the past 6 months in this country.   On December 20, 2017, Republicans in Congress passed the most  historic tax reform in three decades, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act. That day will long be remembered as a time when American families  and businesses were once again made a priority.   As a small-business owner myself, I have spent my time in Congress  fighting for tax cuts that would allow Main Street to breathe again.   Small business optimism is at an all-time high across Texas' 25th  District. Employers are increasing their workforce and raising wages.   Tax reform has created more than 1 million jobs, which has brought  unemployment down to 3.8 percent. That is incredible.   Mr. Speaker, all of this is great, but I want the American people to  know that we are not done yet. Congress is not done yet. I am  continuing to work to strengthen the economy and make tax cuts  permanent.   We will fight year after year to make America more competitive, keep  our Tax Code simpler, flatter, and fairer. Business is simply good.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
