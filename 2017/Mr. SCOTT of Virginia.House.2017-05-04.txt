 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, and I remind my colleague that her vote for this bill could  increase premiums for people with breast cancer in Tennessee by over  $38,000.   Mr. Speaker, let's begin with a few facts:   Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, costs have gone up at  the lowest rate in 50 years;   Those with preexisting conditions get insurance at the standard rate;   Instead of millions of people losing their insurance every year, 20  million more people have insurance;   Personal bankruptcies are down 50 percent.  [[Page H4150]]    Still, all we hear are complaints, press releases, and promises about  something better. But CBO has debunked this proposal by pointing out  that 24 million fewer people will have insurance, that costs will go  up, and insurance will cover less.   So, whatever you think about the Affordable Care Act, this bill makes  things worse--except for millionaires, who get a tax cut.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his  vote for this bill could take healthcare protections away from over a  million people in Tennessee with preexisting conditions.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms.  Bonamici), the vice ranking member of the Committee on Education and  the Workforce.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his  vote for this healthcare bill will take away protections for over  600,000 people in Oregon with preexisting conditions.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Takano).  [[Page H4151]]    (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.   (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his  vote for this bill could take away protections of over 4.5 million  people with preexisting conditions in Texas who might have access to  coverage, but if they have diabetes, their rates could go up $5,000.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from North Carolina  (Ms. Adams).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter  from Common Sense Kids Action that explains that: ``This jeopardizes  the health and well-being of America's kids and will alarm any parent  who understands the importance of health insurance for their children  and family.''                                        common sense kids action,                                                     April 25, 2017.      Re H.R. 1628--OPPOSE.      Hon. Diane Black,      Chairwoman, House Budget Committee,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Black: On behalf of the millions of       American kids and families who rely on comprehensive,       dependable health insurance to stay healthy and to get       medical treatment when they need it, we are writing to       respectfully express our strong opposition to your bill, H.R.       1628, the American Health Care Act (AHCA). We have added this       bill to our Common Sense Legislative Ratings Tool as an       ``Against Kids'' bill and will communicate our position to       our parent and teacher members.        Common Sense is the nation's leading independent nonprofit       organization dedicated to helping kids thrive in a rapidly       changing world. We empower parents, teachers, and       policymakers by providing unbiased information, trusted       advice, and innovative tools to help them harness the power       of media and technology as a positive force in all kids'       lives. The policy arm, Common Sense Kids Action, is building       a movement of parents, teachers, business leaders, and others       dedicated to making kids our nation's top priority by       supporting policies at the state and federal level that       contribute to the building blocks of opportunity for kids.       Access to affordable and quality medical care for kids is       certainly one of those key building blocks.        Thanks to current law, including the Affordable Care Act,       Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP),       95% of young children in the U.S. today have health       insurance. That's a remarkable achievement. With health       insurance, parents are more likely to seek medical care for       themselves and for their children, helping to prevent       illnesses from developing and shortening their duration when       they occur. However, the AHCA will result in 24 million fewer       Americans having coverage, including millions of children.       This jeopardizes the health and well-being of America's kids       and will alarm any parent who understands the importance of       health insurance for their children and family. The       Affordable Care Act certainly needs to be fixed, but if       Congress has the goal of making sure that all families and       businesses have access to affordable and comprehensive health       insurance, it could improve the law for everyone without       forcing millions of kids and their parents to lose access to       critical medical care.        As Congress continues to grapple with this issue, health       insurance programs, we think these facts about children's       health insurance from the Congressional Budget Office and the       Georgetown University Center for Children and Families are       important to keep in mind:        Ninety-five percent of children age 0-5 are insured today.        Forty-five million of those children access health care       through two programs: about 37 million through Medicaid (a       federal-state program) and 8 million through CHIP, the       Children's Health Insurance Program.        Children are the single-largest group of persons covered       under Medicaid.        Under the Affordable Care Act, as you know, many states       expanded Medicaid with help from the federal government,       increasing coverage for kids and families, including coverage       for mental health care.        Changes being considered, including under the AHCA, would       cut funding to Medicaid by as much as $880 billion over the       next 10 years.        The AHCA, when compared with current law, would result in       24 million fewer Americans with health insurance by the year       2026.        Even with changes recently suggested to your bill,       America's kids will be best served by strengthening the       Affordable Care Act and preserving Medicaid and CHIP, not by       repealing the Affordable Care Act and block granting or       establishing a per capita cap on Medicaid. We urge you to       keep our children's future foremost in your thinking,       withdraw your bill, and work on a bipartisan basis to support       measures that protect and strengthen children's health care.       Thank you for your consideration of our views and we would be       happy to talk with you at any time about this and other       issues that matter to America's children and families.            Sincerely,                                                    Danny Weiss,                                     Vice President, Federal Policy,                                    Common Sense Media/Kids Action.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Jeffries).   (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)  [[Page H4153]]         Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an  article in Consumer Reports dated May 2, 2017, entitled: ``How the  Affordable Care Act Drove Down Personal Bankruptcy.''         How the Affordable Care Act Drove Down Personal Bankruptcy      Expanded health insurance helped cut the number of filings by half                            (By Allen St. John)         As legislators and the executive branch renew their efforts       to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act this week, they       might want to keep in mind a little-known financial       consequence of the ACA: Since its adoption, far fewer       Americans have taken the extreme step of filing for personal       bankruptcy.        Filings have dropped about 50 percent, from 1,536,799 in       2010 to 770,846 in 2016 (see chart, below). Those years also       represent the time frame when the ACA took effect. Although       courts never ask people to declare why they're filing, many       bankruptcy and legal experts agree that medical bills had       been a leading cause of personal bankruptcy before public       healthcare coverage expanded under the ACA. Unlike other       causes of debt, medical bills are often unexpected,       involuntary, and large.        ``If you're uninsured or underinsured, you can run up a       huge debt in a short period of time,'' says Lois Lupica, a       bankruptcy expert and Maine Law Foundation Professor of Law       at the University of Maine School of Law.        So did the rise of the ACA--which helped some 20 million       more Americans get health insurance--cause the decline in       bankruptcies?        The many experts we interviewed also pointed to two other       contributing factors: an improving economy and changes to       bankruptcy laws in 2005 that made it more difficult and       costly to file. However, they almost all agreed that expanded       health coverage played a major role in the marked, recent       decline.        Some of the most important financial protections of the ACA       apply to all consumers, whether they get their coverage       through ACA exchanges or the private insurance marketplace.       These provisions include mandated coverage for pre-existing       conditions and, on most covered benefits, an end to annual       and lifetime coverage caps. Aspects of the law, including       provisions for young people to be covered by a family policy       until age 26, went into effect in 2010 and 2011, before the       full rollout of the ACA in 2014.        ``It's absolutely remarkable,'' says Jim Molleur, a Maine-      based bankruptcy attorney with 20 years of experience.       ``We're not getting people with big medical bills,       chronically sick people who would hit those lifetime caps or       be denied because of pre-existing conditions. They seemed to       disappear almost overnight once ACA kicked in.''        The first attempt to repeal and replace the ACA, in March,       failed to gain enough Congressional support and never came to       a vote.        Then in April, details of a new replacement plan were       released. Although President Donald Trump has said that this       new version, like the first bill that was pulled from       consideration, will cover pre-existing conditions, the       revised law gives states broad latitude to allow insurance       companies to increase rates for consumers with an existing       illness.                         A Rare and Costly Diagnosis         Since the start of the year, more than 2,000 consumers have       answered an online questionnaire from Consumer Reports'       advocacy and mobilization team, sharing their experiences       with the ACA. Katie Weber of Seattle was one of them.        In 2011, she had just landed her first job out of college,       as a teacher with AmeriCorps, she explains in a phone       interview. That's when the unusual numbness in her hand       began, which she--and her doctor--at first mistook for a       pinched nerve.        Then came debilitating headaches and nausea and,       ultimately, a diagnosis of medulloblastoma, a fast-growing       cancerous brain tumor.        The treatment for her tumor was straightforward: surgery,       radiation, then chemotherapy. Figuring out how to pay for it       was much less clear. She worried that the insurance she had       through AmeriCorps wouldn't cover enough of her bills.        ``My dad said to me, `Your health is the most important       thing. If you have to declare bankruptcy at age 23, it's no       big deal,' '' Weber says.        Because of the ACA, she says, it never came to that. After       her year with AmeriCorps, the new healthcare law enabled her       to get coverage under her parents' insurance plan.        The ACA provisions required that the family's insurance       company cover her even though she had already been diagnosed       with cancer. That would not have been the case before the       ACA, which mandates the coverage of pre-existing conditions       for all consumers.        Later, when she aged out of her parents' insurance, Weber       was able to enroll in Apple Health, Washington state's       version of Medicaid, a program that was expanded once the ACA       was passed. That coverage, she says, has been crucial to her       financial and medical well-being, especially once the cancer       returned last fall.        Weber says she now spends more time discussing treatment       options and less time worrying how she'll pay for MRIs and       drugs. These are covered in full under her Apple Health       policy.        ``Cancer is really expensive,'' she says. ``My insurance       saved my life.''                               Numbers Plummet         If you want further testimony about how much personal       bankruptcies have dropped over the past decade, talk to Susan       Grossberg, a Springfield, Mass., attorney.        For more than 20 years she has helped consumers push the       financial reset button when debt triggered by divorce,       unemployment, or a costly illness or medical episode became       too much to handle. ``Medical debt can get really big really       quickly,'' Grossberg says. ``When you're in the emergency       room they're not checking your credit score while they're       caring for you.''        With the advent of the ACA--and before that, expanded state       healthcare in Massachusetts--she says fewer clients with       large medical debts walked through her door.        Grossberg adds that her bankruptcy business has slowed so       much that she has been forced to take on other kinds of legal       work--landlord-tenant and housing discrimination cases--to       cover her own bills.        The American Bankruptcy Institute suggested that veteran       Chicago bankruptcy attorney and trustee David Leibowitz could       also help parse the reasons for the decadelong decline.        First, he says, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and       Consumer Protection Act of 2005 made it more difficult for       consumers to file for bankruptcy. The law required credit       counseling and income verification and forced many consumers       to seek protection under Chapter 13, which restructures, but       does not eliminate, most debt. The piles of paperwork also       meant most filers needed a lawyer, which made bankruptcy more       costly and therefore not an option for many poor consumers.        Then there was the economy. After a slow and steady       recovery following the housing crisis of 2008, Leibowitz       explains that American consumers generally had fewer problems       with their mortgages, better employment prospects, and       greater access to credit, which made them less likely to       file.        The final factor, according to Leibowitz, has been the ACA,       which afforded health coverage to many more consumers and       expanded protections for all.        Of course, not everyone sees such a direct connection       between the decline in bankruptcies and the emergence of the       ACA.        Thomas P. Miller, resident fellow at the American       Enterprise Institute and co-author of ``Why ObamaCare is       Wrong for America'' (HarperCollins, 2011), cautioned against       ``reaching broad conclusions'' because the subject is so       complex.        ``Certainly there are fewer people declaring bankruptcy,       and certainly fewer are declaring bankruptcy because of       healthcare spending,'' he says. But his earlier research       suggested that some studies exaggerated the degree to which       high healthcare bills cause bankruptcies. ``They tended to       reflect other problems with credit card balances well beyond       healthcare,'' he says. ``It stems from multiple causes.''                               Figuring Out Why         Over the past decade, determining the cause-and-effect       relationship between medical debt and bankruptcy has become a       political football, particularly during the years the Obama       administration was trying to pass the ACA through Congress.        The truth is that it's not that easy to determine how many       bankruptcies are caused by medical debt. Examining the       paperwork doesn't always offer insight because debtors often       juggle their indebtedness, for example, using a credit card       to pay an outstanding medical bill while leaving other debts       unpaid.        But a 2014 study from Daniel Austin, a bankruptcy attorney       and, at the time, a professor at the Northeastern University       School of Law, offers some of the most in-depth research to       date.        Austin and his team selected a nationwide group of 100       bankruptcy filers meant to represent a cross-section of the       U.S. population, studied their paperwork, then followed up       with a survey asking filers, basically, ``Why?''        His team's research found that medical debt is the single       largest factor in personal bankruptcy. First, Austin analyzed       the paperwork of individual case files, which suggested that       medical bills were a factor in 18 percent of filings. But       when he directly asked the same filers, in a survey, the       number was even higher, with 25 percent citing medical bills       as a factor in their decision to file bankruptcy.        In addition to the nationwide group, Austin isolated a       group of 100 bankruptcy filers from Massachusetts.       Why Massachusetts? Because its citizens, starting in 2006,       had been covered by a comprehensive state healthcare       program similar to the ACA known as Romneycare, after the       state's former governor, Mitt Romney.        The differences between the two groups were striking. Even       though the Massachusetts filers owed substantially more in       unsecured debt (that is, debt not backed by a home, a car, or       another asset) than their counterparts in other states, they       reported less than half as much medical debt, which is also       unsecured.        ``The average medical debt in Massachusetts in 2013 was       relatively low at just $3,041 (6 percent of total unsecured       debt) compared to $8,594 (20 percent of total unsecured debt)       nationwide,'' Austin writes in his 2014 study,  [[Page H4155]]       portions of which were published in the Maine Law Review.        ``Only about 9 percent of Massachusetts debtors felt their       bankruptcy filing was a result of medical bills,'' Austin       explains. ``This compares to 25 percent for debtors from       [other] jurisdictions.'' Austin's research found that       comprehensive medical coverage in Massachusetts had all but       eliminated medical bills as a cause for bankruptcy.        ``Not only in absolute numbers--they had much smaller       medical debt--but psychologically, medical debt did not loom       nearly as large for people in Massachusetts as it did for       other people in other states.'' And in 2010, four years after       Romneycare began, the state had a bankruptcy rate that was       about 30 percent lower than that of other states.                     In Search of Certainty, Consistency         At its most basic level, health insurance allows consumers       to pay for the medical care they need. Each year, the Centers       for Disease Control and Prevention determines how well the       system is working by surveying Americans and asking a simple       but powerful question: Did you have problems paying medical       bills in the last 12 months?        The percentage of those reporting problems has dropped from       21.3 percent of households when they first asked the question       in 2011 to 16.2 percent in 2016. That's almost 13 million       fewer Americans no longer facing collection notices from a       doctor or hospital.        ``It's been happening across the board, by race, by age, by       insurance status, by gender,'' says Robin Cohen, the study's       lead author.        But insurance is also about peace of mind. And judging from       the consumers who have shared their stories with Consumer       Reports, that certainty is in short supply as the fate of the       ACA is decided. People are wondering what comes next: Repeal?       Replace? Improve? Retain and neglect? No one really knows the       answer. Americans are concerned about how the future of       healthcare will affect them and their families.        In CR's Consumer Voices survey in January 2017, 55 percent       of consumers said they lacked confidence that they or their       loved ones would be able to afford insurance to secure that       care.        Don Shope of Ocean View, Del., said the availability of ACA       coverage gave him the confidence to leave a corporate job and       start his own consulting business. But now, with the ACA's       future in limbo, he and his wife are watching the action in       Washington and worrying that they might have to return to       jobs with benefits.        ``I'm not a liberal or a conservative, a Democrat or a       Republican,'' Shope said in a phone interview. ``Our biggest       concern is that with repeal and replace we're going to be       left high and dry.''        He also believes in expanded health coverage for all. ``If       any American is sick, we should be willing to take care of       them,'' Shope says. ``It's the right thing to do. Economics       and profit shouldn't be part of the healthcare equation.''                        Hanging On Every Dip and Turn         And then there's Kristin Couch, who has channeled the       uncertainty into her own brand of activism.        ``I was kind of anxious,'' Couch says about the day in       March when Congress was set to vote on a less robust bill       that would replace the ACA.        The 31-year-old public relations executive, of Gainesville,       Ga., has started to follow health-care politics in the       intense, almost obsessive way some people follow sports. The       morning after Election Day, she called the offices of her       local congressional representatives, urging them to preserve       the protections the ACA offers.        Couch began caring about healthcare as a high school senior       when she was diagnosed with lupus and since then has become       something of a reluctant expert on how to manage not only her       treatment but also the insurance that pays for it.        With friends and neighbors she talks about the law in       simple but personal terms. ``I tell people, `I have a pre-      existing condition, and this has helped me,' '' she says of       the ACA. Couch follows the healthcare debate in Washington so       closely because she knows firsthand what happens when you       don't have adequate coverage.        Couch remembers the time, before the ACA, when a new       immunosuppressive drug that wasn't covered by her policy       became available. ``It was expensive,'' she explained in an       interview, ``but it worked, and I knew I needed it. Every       month I'd just put it on a credit card. When your medication       is thousands of dollars a month, that's the start of being in       debt.'' She considered bankruptcy but ultimately worked her       way out from under the pile of medical bills.        As a result of the ACA, her coverage shifted again when her       employer no longer offered a traditional plan and she had to       switch to one with a high $3,000 deductible. Initially she       was stunned by her out-of-pocket costs, but she quickly       realized that her total costs would be capped once she'd met       that threshold.        ``It seemed scary and it seemed different,'' she explains.       ``But it actually saved me money.'' And now, she says, ``I       don't have to worry about how much a new drug costs.''        So on the March day the House of Representatives was       supposed to vote on repealing the ACA, she worried that the       insurance she'd come to depend on was about to be yanked       away. Only after emerging from a client meeting did she learn       the vote had been canceled. ``I started crying I was so       happy,'' Couch recalls. ``It's like a weight has lifted.''        But Couch's relief was short-lived. Now she's back to       paying close attention to the rhetoric and vote-counting       deals in Washington, awaiting another possible vote on the       newly revised plan. ``I'm still optimistic,'' she said this       week. ``I think enough people will stand up and fight for the       coverage.''     I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Norcross).    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his  vote for this bill can take away protections for over 800,000 people  with preexisting conditions in Louisiana. For example, those with  breast cancer could see their premiums go up by over $34,000.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Delaware (Ms.  Blunt Rochester).   (Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER asked and was given permission to revise and  extend her remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Krishnamoorthi).

(Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to revise and extend  his remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.   (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend her  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters).   (Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California asked and was given permission to  revise and extend her remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Conyers).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Walz), the highest ranking enlisted soldier ever  elected to Congress.   (Mr. WALZ asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Hanabusa).
