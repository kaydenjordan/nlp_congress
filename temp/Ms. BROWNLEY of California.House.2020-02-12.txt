 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for  bringing this important public lands bill to the floor.   H.R. 2546 incorporates a bill I helped introduce along with  Representative Carbajal, the Central Coast Heritage Protection Act.   The Central Coast Heritage Protection Act sets aside more than 40,000  acres in the Los Padres National Forest as wilderness. It also  designates the Condor Trail within Los Padres as a National Recreation  Trail. Both of these actions have long been priorities of my  constituents, and so I am pleased the House is taking action on them  today.   We in Ventura County are so fortunate to be surrounded by gorgeous  public spaces, including the Los Padres National Forest. Designating  these lands as wilderness will strengthen environmental protections in  our region and preserve this important part of our natural heritage for  future generations to enjoy.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman, again, for bringing this bill  forward.
