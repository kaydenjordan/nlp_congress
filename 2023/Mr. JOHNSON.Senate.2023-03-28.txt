 Mr. President, last December, the World Health Assembly  established an intergovernmental negotiating body to draft a new  convention on pandemic prevention and preparedness.   At its fourth meeting last month, the negotiating body accepted a  draft of this new convention that would give the World Health  Organization broad new powers in managing future pandemics. If  accepted, it would cement the World Health Organization at the center  of a global system for managing future pandemics, and it would erode  U.S. sovereignty.   Let me just list a few of the examples of some of the provisions of  this draft--and I will call it a treaty. Currently, it would require a  substantial new U.S. financial commitment to an international body  without proportional voting power.   It would require the U.S. to give the World Health Organization 20  percent of vaccines and other pandemic-related products produced during  future pandemics. It includes a heavy emphasis on the transfer of  intellectual property rights to the World Health Organization.   It gives the World Health Organization a leading role in fighting  misinformation and disinformation, and as the Twitter files reveal,  that leads to censorship and the suppression and abridging of freedom  of speech.   It also promotes a global one-health approach to healthcare,  including harmonizing regulation under WHO guidance. The WHO has not  earned this power--far from it. At a critical moment in late 2019 and  early 2020, the WHO utterly failed to detect the emerging COVID-19  pandemic and delayed in forming its member states. Instead, it was  kowtowing to Beijing.   Unfortunately, there are indications that the Biden administration is  considering joining this new convention by executive agreement and  avoiding the Senate. We should not let this happen. An agreement of  such magnitude needs to be submitted to the Senate for advice and  consent. This is not a partisan issue; this is about reclaiming the  Senate's prerogatives on international agreement.   Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 11 and ask that it be  reported by number.    Mr. President, this amendment is very simple, it  declares any pandemic convention produced by the intergovernmental  negotiating body to be a treaty requiring Senate advice and consent.   I had a similar amendment on the Iranian agreement a few years ago.  It is far past time that the Members of this body reclaim our  Constitutional authority at ratifying these incredibly serious treaties  and no longer allow the administration to go ahead and negotiate  agreements that can have a dramatic impact on our sovereignty and  bypass the Senate entirely.   So, again, a very simple amendment, it would deem any amendment a  treaty and require that it be ratified by the Senate, and I urge all my  colleagues to support my amendment.    Mr. President, there is nothing in my amendment that  would harm what the Senator from Virginia tried to accomplish in  repealing the authorization for use of military force. So my amendment  can be accepted and have no impact whatsoever on the legislation before  the floor or the body.                           Vote on Amendment No. 11
