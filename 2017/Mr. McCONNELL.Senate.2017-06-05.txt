 Mr. President, over the weekend, our friends and  allies suffered yet another tragic loss as terrorists struck in London,  claiming several innocent lives and injuring dozens more. Our steadfast  allies, the British, have confronted terrorism for decades, and our  friends have endured so much these past several months at the hands of  terrorists. Our hearts go out to them.   The Senate holds the victims of the attack and their families in our  thoughts, and we once again express our gratitude to all of the first  responders, medical professionals, and citizens who bravely stepped in  to help.   Our fight against terrorism will go on, and together we will target  terrorist networks and propagandists. We will continue to stand by the  British people, especially in this time of great difficulty.   Mr. President, this week marks the 50th anniversary of the beginning  of the Six-Day War. Confronted by the massing Arab armies and the  closing of the Tiran Straits, Israel responded, and in a fight for  survival, ultimately prevailed. As a result, the city of Jerusalem was  finally reunified after years of division. The reunification of the  city allowed for people of all faiths to worship and to access the  respective holy sites throughout Jerusalem.   In honor of this significant anniversary for our close ally, many  Senators from both sides of the aisle--including the Democratic leader  and myself--are joining together in a resolution to mark the occasion  today.   While we know Israel continues to face a number of threats,  bipartisan adoption of this resolution will serve as yet another  indication of the commitment of the United States of standing by our  friends in Israel. I look forward to supporting it later this afternoon  and working to strengthen our relationship with that nation in the  years to come.                           Remembering Jim Bunning    Mr. President, on May 26, the Commonwealth of Kentucky lost a  legendary figure with the passing of Senator Jim Bunning. For more than  two decades, Jim was my colleague here in Congress. Before that, he was  a storied Major League Baseball pitcher, earning him a spot in  Cooperstown. Today, I remember Jim Bunning, a Hall of Famer in life.   Jim's career in the majors spanned 17 seasons, where he pitched  primarily for the Tigers and the Phillies. In that time, he earned 224  career wins and struck out 2,855 batters. Of his many impressive  accomplishments on the diamond, Jim's two greatest pitching  achievements were his no-hitter in 1958 and the perfect game he threw  in 1964, a feat that has only been accomplished 23 times in all of  baseball history.   In recognition of his career with the Phillies, the team retired  Jim's No. 14 jersey, and his baseball career was finally capped off by  his election to the Hall of Fame in 1996 by the Veterans Committee.   Anyone would be proud with such a resume, but for Jim it was only the  first act. Jim moved back to Fort Thomas in northern Kentucky. Over the  next three decades, he served at all levels of government, from the  Fort Thomas City Council to the Kentucky State Senate, to both Chambers  of the U.S. Congress, including 12 years in the House and 12 in the  Senate. Jim dedicated his life to serving the people of Kentucky, and  Kentuckians are truly grateful for his work.   He was a man of principle from start to finish. He stayed true to  himself. As Congressional Quarterly once wrote, ``All agree . . . that  [Bunning] is unafraid to go his own way.'' Throughout his career, Jim  took many principled stands, even if it meant standing alone. In his  farewell address to the Senate, he said: ``I have been booed by 60,000  fans in Yankee Stadium, standing alone on the mound, so I never cared  if I stood alone in Congress, as long as I stood by my beliefs and my  values.''   That summed up Jim Bunning, but in his life, Jim really never did  stand alone. Through trials and hardships, he always had his loving  wife Mary by his side. Jim would have been the first to tell you that  his success in life would not have been possible without Mary. She  stood with him through both the glory and the hardships of his baseball  career, and was, in Jim's words, his ``rock,'' his ``best fan,'' and  his ``best friend.'' Together, they helped raise the nine children Jim  is survived by today. He is also survived by 35 grandchildren--one of  whom, by the way, once worked in my office--and 21 great-grandchildren.  It is clear the two most important things to Jim were always his family  and his deeply held Catholic faith.   Jim was a man of strong beliefs and good character. Never one to make  excuses, he worked hard at whatever he put his mind to; first, in  baseball as a legendary pitcher and then as a voice for the people of  Kentucky for over 30 years. With an unshakeable commitment to his  family and the firm principles guiding him, Jim was truly a ``hall of  famer'' in life.   On behalf of the entire Senate family, I would like to offer  heartfelt condolences to Mary, their family, friends, and all who knew  and loved Senator Jim Bunning.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 110,  S. 722.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 184, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  June 6; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour  be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; further, that following leader remarks,  the Senate proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the  Elwood nomination as under the previous order; finally, that the Senate  recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly  conference meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the provisions of S. Res. 184, as a further mark of respect to  the late Jim Bunning, former United States Senator from the  Commonwealth of Kentucky.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:33 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, June 6, 2017, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
