 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, John  Garamendi, for taking up the special orders and for doing such a  striking job, compelling job, of lining out what the country needs to  do in the way of building our roads and bridges and our energy  infrastructure. So much that needs to be done that would make a big  difference for jobs, for our economy; and then contrasting that,  unfortunately, with what the President, after a year of looking forward  to this, seems to have come up with. It is just baffling, and I think  we need to understand here tonight what is going on and resolve to do  better. We have got to do better than this.   Although the President is, of course, onto a major issue, we have  always said that. During the campaign, in the early months of the new  administration, President Trump spoke a lot about infrastructure,  promised to put forward a bold plan to put Americans to work,  repairing, modernizing our infrastructure.   Now, many issues divide Democrats and Republicans, but that really  isn't one of them. This is an issue that potentially, at least, unifies  us, brings us together. During the last election, both candidates were  talking infrastructure. It stood out as an area of common ground,  potential bipartisan cooperation.   Unfortunately, I am afraid, now, after a year, and after a year of  concentrating on other things like repealing healthcare and a massive  tax cut for the wealthy, now, finally, the President does come around  to infrastructure, and, frankly, it is pretty underwhelming. The plan  doesn't make good on the promise that he put forward during the  campaign for a serious bipartisan plan. It certainly isn't bipartisan.   It calls for $1.5 trillion in new investment, but it shifts the  overwhelming majority of the cost to States and municipalities, forcing  them to either raise taxes or to sell off public assets or to cut other  critical programs. So it is, on the face of it, just inadequate.   The Federal investment: $200 billion supposed to leverage $1.5  trillion. And it reverses the split in terms of Federal  [[Page H1109]]  and State responsibility. That is an 80/20 Federal-State split now, in  most cases. Now it is going to go something like 20/80, and the States  and the localities are burdened with taking this on with very limited  and very inadequate Federal support. So it is inadequate, and it is  certainly inadequate as a Federal investment.   Secondly, and my colleague has stressed this very effectively, this  is a bait and switch. This is a bait and switch.   I am the ranking Democrat on the Transportation and Housing  Appropriations Subcommittee. So we are now, with the budget agreement  enacted last week, looking forward, hopefully in a bipartisan way, to  writing a transportation bill for the remainder of 2018. Transportation  investments that have bipartisan support are now in sight because of  this budget agreement. But then along comes, ironically, the  President's infrastructure plan alongside his budget proposal, which  actually decimates the transportation programs we already have.                                time  1945    Mr. Garamendi stressed that very effectively. I will add just a few  specifics, but this is the most incredible part of this plan to me. It  not only falls short, but it actually does great damage to the  infrastructure investments we are already making.   For example, we are building Union Station in Raleigh, North  Carolina, at this moment. It is going to be a multimodal facility. It  is going to facilitate transit bus transportation. It is also an  intercity rail station with an Amtrak train leaving for Charlotte three  times a day. That is going to be increased because it is a very  successful run. Union Station, a multimodal facility: the essence of  infrastructure, creating jobs.   How do you think Raleigh is paying for that?   It would be known as a TIGER grant, along with State and local  participation. The President's budget totally eliminates TIGER grants,  which have provided that kind of support around this country for  innovative infrastructure projects, particularly multimodal projects.   TIGER grants: eliminated in the President's budget.   Community Development Block Grants: eliminated in the President's  budget.   What on Earth are they thinking down there at the White House, to be  simultaneously talking about a great infrastructure initiative and, at  the same time, taking away the basic bread and butter infrastructure  programs we already have?   Aviation: the President wants to cut Federal aviation appropriations.   FAA facilities and equipment: cut.   FAA operations: cut.   What are they thinking?   And then most incredible of all, when you turn to the ground  transportation budget, they want to eliminate all new starts for mass  transit in this country: cut the so-called capital investment grants  radically.   The President wants to cut the very successful Northeast Corridor  Amtrak operations radically. He wants even more to cut Amtrak  operations in places like the Southeastern United States, the Midwest,  and California--these very promising regional routes.   And this is an infrastructure program?   It certainly sounds like an anti-infrastructure program.   It does not add up. It doesn't begin to add up.   I think this is the most outrageous aspect of this: that the  President is coming out with what he markets as a new, bold initiative,  and, at the same time, he is actually not just trimming, he is  radically cutting, as far as I can tell, all modes of transportation,  virtually everything we count on to underwrite and support  infrastructure at present.   Then, finally, the President is making a big thing out of rolling  back environmental protections and limiting the review of projects.  Now, we all know--and Democrats and Republicans have gotten together on  this in the FAST Act, for example--that review needs to be expedited  and review needs to be efficient.   The FAST Act contains many provisions to expedite review, and those  aren't even fully implemented yet. But here we come with the  President's infrastructure initiative, which proposes the arbitrary  shortening of deadlines. It purports to override the National  Environmental Policy Act, possibly even the Clean Water Act and Clean  Air Act. It is hard to tell exactly what he has in mind. There is  virtually no investment in clean energy infrastructure, which one would  think would be a major forward-looking component of any infrastructure  package.   Representative Alan Lowenthal and I co-chair a task force called the  Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition--so-called SEEC--and we  have released in the last couple of days a sustainable infrastructure  proposal. When you place it alongside what the President seems to be  suggesting, with some details yet to be announced, there is a great  contrast.   What we are advocating is that we invest smartly and we invest  sustainably. We have no desire to destroy the core environmental  safeguards. In fact, we want to have a meaningful, serious review  process. We want to incorporate forward-looking sustainability and  resiliency initiatives in our infrastructure plan.   So I commend to my colleagues this report, which we just issued,  which I hope will gain attention from both sides of the aisle as we  attempt to deal with the President's proposal, to deal with the  appropriations bills that we are going to be considering here, and try  to build into our infrastructure proposals sound environmental  practices, and sustainable practices, for example, taking into account  climate change--global warming.   The President reportedly has no intention of including that in his  proposal. What a shortsighted thing that would be, to be building  bridges and highways and other projects, and then some years from now  find that the planning was inadequate to deal with the sea level rise,  or whatever kind of effects of global warming we might have.   So, again, I thank my colleague for helping us understand what we  need to do as a country, but also understanding how we really need, as  a Congress--and I would hope both sides of the aisle. We need to assert  ourselves, not just assume that this is some kind of Trump proposal  that we can't criticize. Or, in fact, we need to not just criticize it,  but we need to do far, far better. So I thank the gentleman.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I know the gentleman shares  [[Page H1110]]  my sense that we need to diversify our transportation system in this  country. We, in particular, need to develop high-speed rail in these  corridors where it makes so much sense. Raleigh to Charlotte has been a  kind of demonstration of what is possible there.   And transit is not a Democratic or a Republican issue. Our cities-- large and small cities--throughout this country are getting into  transit: bus rapid transit, light rail, and regional rail.   And the notion that, ironically, especially on the same week you are  announcing an infrastructure plan, you would, at the same time, say no  new starts in transit is just beyond belief.    Will the gentleman yield?    That appears to be what is happening. Or  else the OMB Director and the President's people in the White House  doing this infrastructure plan never checked with each other.   I do think the bait-and-switch aspect is the most incredible aspect  of this because it really, really would damage transportation efforts  that we already depend on.
