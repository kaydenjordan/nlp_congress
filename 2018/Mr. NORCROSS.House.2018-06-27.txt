 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this  amendment.   We have an opportunity that doesn't come around all that often, thank  God. Apparently, there are people who think this isn't important to our  national defense.   I went up to an electric boat just 2 months ago. This is the most  complicated machine ever designed, ever built in the history of the  world. You don't turn this on and off like a spigot of water.   This is about saving our country. You heard the chairman talk about  how we are falling behind as a country. How can we sit by and let this  go? We must come together. We have to build this now or we are putting  our country at risk.
