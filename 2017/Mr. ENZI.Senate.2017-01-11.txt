 Mr. President, over the past few days, we have been  listening to the health care horror stories from across the country,  such as families earning an annual income of $50,000 who opted for  high-deductible coverage and are facing up to $6,000 or, in one case,  $10,000 of out-of-pocket costs before their coverage even begins. That  is not affordable insurance.   Nearly 7 years after the enactment of ObamaCare and 3 years into  implementation, one thing is crystal clear: ObamaCare has failed, but  Republicans are working to fix the damage. Over the past several years,  it is clear that this law is simply unworkable for millions of hard- working Americans. Insurance markets are collapsing, premiums are  soaring, and health care choices are disappearing, but the answer isn't  to ignore the problem. With ObamaCare getting worse by the day, it is  time for us to act. The repeal resolution we are debating this week  promises relief from ObamaCare and provides the tools necessary to  immediately repeal this failed law while ensuring a stable transition  period to a patient-centered health care system that gives Americans  access to quality, affordable care. The resolution includes  instructions to authorizing committees so that repeal legislation can  move through a fast track process and can pass with a simple majority  in the House and Senate. These instructions to committees are provided  to allow immediate action on repeal with the intent of sending  legislation to the new President's desk as soon as possible.    Headlines from across the Nation highlight the urgent call to action.  The New York Times says: ``Obamacare Premiums Set to Rise Even for  Savvy Shoppers.'' The Wall Street Journal says: ``Insurers Move to  Limit Options in Health-Care Exchange Plans.'' The Baltimore Sun says:  ``Marylanders face hefty rate increases for ObamaCare.'' The Omaha  World Herald says: ``Health insurance rate increases may have some  Nebraskans in sticker shock.'' The Miami Herald says: ``Florida's  ObamaCare premiums to rise average 19 percent in 2017, the State  says.'' And the Bergen County Record says: ``New Jersey left with just  two ObamaCare health providers for 2017.''   My own State of Wyoming is down to one insurer in the individual  market, both on and off the exchange. That is a national scandal. We  have heard from people who talked about counties where there are no  insurers. We have heard people talk about the costs they have both for  the premiums and the deductibles. And just talking about the premiums,  in New Mexico they had some counties where the average cost of a house  payment is less than the monthly cost of their health care--much less,  about 50 percent less in one instance.   It is also important to look at the facts surrounding ObamaCare. Some  on the other side of the aisle like to focus on how many people are  insured under the law, but let's look at how many are not insured.  Almost 28 million Americans remain without insurance under ObamaCare.  Even with insurance, many still can't afford the care due to surging  deductibles. If you can't afford the deductible, you really don't have  insurance. If you can't afford the insurance, you don't have insurance.  And it isn't the insurance that is important; it is the availability of  providers that can take care of you. Most of the newly insured gained  coverage only through a flawed Medicaid program that is providing  inferior quality and threatening to bankrupt States across the Nation.   According to research from the architect of ObamaCare, Jonathan  Gruber--he explicitly said that most of the newly enrolled  beneficiaries were actually eligible for Medicaid before ObamaCare. In  fact, his research showed that two-thirds of new people signing up for  Medicaid were brought into the program, not through ObamaCare but by  increased Medicaid advertising.   As America soon discovered, the President and congressional Democrats  focused exclusively on coverage and mandates that were handed down from  Washington instead of patient-centered reforms. Coverage was the silver  bullet for them because coverage equaled health care. They forgot a key  detail though: The cost of the plans that were mandated made it nearly  impossible for many to pay for the insurance or, if they had coverage,  to pay for care with the sky-high deductibles. I know that some people  on my staff had health savings accounts that gave them catastrophic  coverage. They didn't have to worry about going bankrupt over health  care. Their deductibles were lower than the ones that we have with this  health care.   Focusing on and highlighting the number of people now enrolled in  ObamaCare doesn't translate into anything more than phantom insurance,  which, for users plagued by inadequate coverage, is coupled with huge  out-of-pocket costs. We are seeing families now having to forgo medical  care, not because they don't have insurance but because it is simply  too expensive to go to the doctor with their ObamaCare health plan.   Normally I would say that you get what you pay for. But with  ObamaCare, you seem to just pay without getting much at all. It is kind  of like buying a bus ticket, but when you show up for the trip, they  tell you that to get a seat, you are going to have to spend a little  bit more, and then you have to chip in for the gas.   For years, Republicans have pledged to repeal this disastrous law.  Passing this resolution is just the first step in keeping that promise,  clearing the way for consideration of repeal legislation that will be  signed into law by the new President. While providing immediate relief  from ObamaCare, Republicans will ensure it is a stable transition in  which those with insurance will not lose access to health care  coverage. This will allow the Nation to move to a patient-centered  health care system that gives hard-working Americans access to quality,  affordable care. The goal is a more modern health care system where  there is innovation to improve the health of all Americans, where  insurers are offered new and affordable options, and where families  have a more direct say over their own health care decisions.  [[Page S236]]    Unwinding partisan gridlock to make these changes will not be easy.  As I noted in my earlier remarks, our Nation has made great strides in  improving the quality of life for all Americans, but these transforming  changes are always forged in the spirit of bipartisan compromise and  cooperation. We still need health care reform, but it has to be done  the right way. Passing this resolution will start building a bridge  from ObamaCare's broken promises to better care for each and every  American.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, while we are waiting for the unanimous  consent agreement that will kick off the evening, I feel compelled to  make a couple of comments.   I don't want people to be confused as the evening goes on. This is  not the bill that repeals ObamaCare. This is the bill that sets up the  process that will repeal ObamaCare. This is a preliminary step that is  necessary in order to do what everybody is claiming will be done  tonight, and that is not accurate.   So we will hear a bunch of things that people are concerned about,  but this bill in it has budget numbers. The budget numbers reflect  where we are--not where we would like to be and not where we have been.  They are just the numbers of where we are. Then, in the resolution,  there is a requirement that the Finance Committee save $1 billion, and  the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee save $1 billion,  and they get to do that with some privileged legislation, as long as we  keep it privileged. There will be a number of attempts tonight to see  if they can get rid of the privilege by using corrosive or nongermane  amendments. Consequently, we will have to vote down some of those  amendments. It might sound logical, and it is because they are not in  the bill.    I guess we are still waiting for the unanimous consent agreement so  at this point I will yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The Senator from Wyoming.    Mr. President, for some additional information of what is  happening, we are organizing lists of what tranche the votes will be  in. Just because they are not listed in this first group, doesn't mean  they are not going to be considered. In fact, under a budget  resolution, we have what is called a vote-arama. Actually, any  amendment can be turned in until we finish voting. Unlike other  activity that we usually have where we know what votes there will be  well in advance, this is a special exercise and it is handled a little  differently and it is a lot more confusing.   We will begin in a while. We will begin processing these amendments  one at a time. For debate, just so people know for sure which amendment  we are on, the proponent for the amendment will get 1 minute and the  opponent for that amendment will get 1 minute. At the end of those 2  minutes, we will vote. The first vote is supposed to take 15 minutes.  The Senate is seldom held to 15 minutes. After that, we often go to 10- minute votes, which in the Senate usually only takes about 30 minutes.   That is the way we do it here. We make sure everybody gets their  chance to vote. We hope people will be around so they can get here  punctually and cast their vote. We think the amount of time from 10  minutes can be reduced if people are interested in reducing the amount  of time to do them.   I got the signal that we now have the final list.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to call up  the following amendments and have them reported en bloc: Manchin, No.  64; Nelson, No. 13; Baldwin, No. 81; Tester, No. 104; Klobuchar, No.  172; Casey, No. 61; King, No. 60; Menendez, No. 83; Gillibrand, No. 82;  Manchin, No. 63; and Stabenow, No. 94.   You will see, in spite of that listing, we are going to have some  additional consent needed here.   I ask unanimous consent that those be on the list for now.   I further ask unanimous consent that at 6:15 p.m., all time be  yielded back and the Senate vote on the amendments in the order listed,  except for the following amendments, which will be voted on first:  Nelson, No. 13; King, No. 60; a Barrasso side-by-side amendment, the  text of which is at the desk; Manchin, No. 64; that there be no second- degree amendments in order to these four amendments prior to the votes;  finally, that there be 2 minutes, equally divided between the managers  or their designees, prior to each vote and that all votes after the  first in this series be 10 minutes in length.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?    Klobuchar, No. 172?    Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 173 and ask  unanimous consent that it be reported by number.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The clerk will report the amendment by number.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi], for Mr. Barrasso,       proposes an amendment numbered 173.    The amendment is as follows:  (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to rural               health and repealing and replacing Obamacare)         At the end of title III, add the following:       SEC. 3___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO RURAL                     HEALTH AND REPEALING AND REPLACING OBAMACARE.         The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate       may revise the allocations of a committee or committees,       aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution       for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments,       amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports       relating to strengthening Social Security and repealing and       replacing Obamacare, which may include step-by-step reforms       providing access to quality, affordable coverage for all       Americans, maintaining access to critical rural health care       services, and safeguarding consumer protections, without       raising new revenue, by the amounts provided in such       legislation for those purposes, provided that such       legislation would not increase the deficit over either the       period of the total of fiscal years 2017 through 2021 or the       period of the total of fiscal years 2017 through 2026.     I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                               Amendment No. 13    There is now 2 minutes of debate on Nelson amendment No. 13.   The Senator from Florida.    Mr. President, this amendment is corrosive to the privilege  of the budget resolution. That means that it is outside the scope of  what is appropriate for this budget resolution. Any inappropriate  amendment could be fatal to the privilege of this resolution, which  would destroy our efforts to repeal ObamaCare. In other words, a vote  in favor of this amendment is a vote against repealing ObamaCare.   In addition, this amendment is not germane to this budget resolution.  This budget resolution is much more focused than a typical budget  resolution. The Congressional Budget Act requires that amendments to a  budget resolution be germane. Since this amendment does not meet that  standard required by budget law, a point of order would lie; as such, I  raise a point of order under section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   The clerk will report the amendments by number.   The bill clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi], for others, proposes       amendments numbered 167 and 176 en bloc.    The amendments are as follows:                              Amendment no. 167     (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to     strengthening Social Security and repealing Obamacare, which has    increased health care costs, raised taxes on middle-class families,   reduced access to high quality care, created disincentives for work,  and caused tens of thousands of Americans to lose coverage they had and    liked, and replacing it with patient-centered, step-by-step health  reforms that provide access to quality, affordable private health care       coverage for all American's and their families by increasing  competition, State flexibility and individual choice, and safeguarding                consumer protections that Americans support)         At the end of title III, add the following:       SEC. 3___.

The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate       may revise the allocations of a committee or committees,       aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution       for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments,       amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports       relating to strengthening Social Security or repealing and       replacing Obamacare, which may include step-by-step health       reforms providing access to quality, affordable coverage for       all Americans, safeguarding consumer protections,       strengthening Medicare, and improving Medicaid, without       raising new revenue, by the amounts provided in such       legislation for those purposes, provided that such       legislation would not increase the deficit over either the       period of the total of fiscal years 2017 through 2021 or the       period of the total of fiscal years 2017 through 2026.                              amendment no. 176     (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to  enhancing health care and housing for veterans and their dependents by      repealing Obamacare, facilitating medical facility leases, and       prohibiting the Secretary of Veterans Affairs from employing   individuals who have been convicted of a felony and medical personnel    who have ever had their medical licenses or credentials revoked or                                 suspended)         At the end of title III, add the following:       SEC. 3___.

The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate       may revise the allocations of a committee or committees,       aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution       for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments,       amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports       relating to improving veterans' housing and health care for       veterans and their dependents, which may include repealing       Obamacare, facilitating medical facility leases, reforming       veterans housing programs, and prohibiting the Secretary of       Veterans Affairs from employing individuals who have been       convicted of a felony and medical personnel who have ever had       their medical licenses or credentials revoked or suspended,       by the amounts provided in such legislation for those       purposes, provided that such legislation would not increase       the deficit over either the period of the total of fiscal       years 2017 through 2021 or the period of the total of fiscal       years 2017 through 2026.                               Amendment No. 64    The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate prior to a  vote on Manchin amendment No. 64.   The Senator from West Virginia.    Mr. President, this amendment is not germane to this budget  resolution. This budget resolution is focused on defeating ObamaCare.  So anything other than that is outside of the scope of the repeal  resolution.   The Congressional Budget Act requires that amendments to a budget  resolution be germane. Since this amendment doesn't meet the standard  required by budget law, a point of order would lie.   So I am compelled as chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to raise  a point of order against the amendment under section 305(b)(2) of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.    Mr. President, making a clarification that the numbers of  the amendments done in the unanimous consent are Heller amendment No.  167, Baldwin amendment No. 81, Flake amendment No. 176, and Tester  amendment No. 104.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The Senator from West Virginia.    Mr. President, this amendment is not germane to this budget  resolution. The Congressional Budget Act requires that amendments to a  budget resolution be germane. Since this amendment does not meet the  standard required by budget law, a point of order would lie against it.   I am compelled as chairman of the Committee on the Budget to raise a  point of order against this amendment under section 305(b)(2) of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the  disposition of the Tester amendment No. 104, the Senate vote in  relation to the Casey amendment No. 61 with all of the provisions of  the previous order remaining in effect; further, that there be no  second-degree amendments in order to the amendment.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.                              Amendment No. 104    There will now be 2 minutes of debate prior to the vote on Tester  amendment No. 104.   The Senator from Montana.    Mr. President, I am hoping we can do something for the  veterans in a bipartisan way under a bill that Senator Isakson worked  on for a long time, but on this amendment, the Congressional Budget Act  requires that amendments to a budget resolution be germane. Since this  amendment doesn't meet the standard required by budget law, a point of  order would lie, so I would raise a point of order against this  amendment under section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of  1974.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.    Mr. President, after the Casey vote, we expect that the  next three votes that we are still working to lock in after this vote  will be Barrasso No. 181, Hatch No. 179, and Menendez No. 83. We are  not asking for a unanimous consent agreement at this point. We just  want people to be aware of the paperwork that is being done so that  they can be ready for votes on those when we do lock them in.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.    I didn't ask unanimous consent. I was just announcing, and  I assume you are just announcing as well.    I didn't ask unanimous consent. I was just announcing, and  I assume you are just announcing as well.    Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Act requires that  amendments to a budget resolution be germane. Since this amendment does  not meet the standard raised by budget law, a point of order would lie.  As such, I raise a point of order against this amendment under section  305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the  disposition of the Casey amendment No. 61, the Senate vote in relation  to the following amendments in the order listed, with all other  provisions of the previous order remaining in effect; further, that  there be no second-degree amendments in order to the amendments listed.  That would be Barrasso No. 181, Hatch No. 179, and Menendez No. 83.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that Senator  Corker be recognized to offer amendment No. 106 and that the amendment  be reported by number. I further ask that there then be 2 minutes of  debate on the amendment to be controlled by Senator Corker or his  designee, and following the use or yielding back of time, the amendment  be withdrawn.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   The Senator from Tennessee.                              Amendment No. 106     Mr. President, I call up Barrasso No. 181 and Hatch No. 179  and ask unanimous consent that they be reported by number.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Vermont.    Mr. President, this discussion will be a little different  than any we have had because in a bipartisan way we have been defeating  this for at least 14 years. Byron Dorgan used to head it up on that  side, and I used to oppose it from this side, but it has always been  bipartisan, and that is because we are not sure about the safety of the  prescription drugs that come in online.   People who drive over the border and go to a pharmacist are probably  getting good drugs there, but we are told that for up to 85 percent of  what comes in online, we can't tell what country it came from. So we  can specify Canada, but it may be from another country altogether,  particularly the Middle East. If we want to assure we have the safety  of our drugs, being able to get it online from even Canada doesn't have  the kind of assurance we need. We have always asked that the Secretary  of Health and Human Services specify that the safety is in place. No  one has been willing to do that.   I ask that we vote against this amendment.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.    Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Act does require  that the amendments to the budget resolution be germane. Since this  amendment does not meet the standard required by budget law, a point of  order would lie. So I raise a point of order against this amendment  under section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote  in relation to the following amendments in the order listed, with all  other provisions of the previous order remaining in effect; further  that there be no second-degree amendments in order to the amendments  listed: Fischer 184, Gillibrand 82, Hatch 180, Brown 86; I further ask  that the pending amendments, aside from these listed, be withdrawn;  that no further amendments be in order, and that following disposition  of the Brown amendment, the Senate vote on adoption of the resolution,  as amended, if amended.  [[Page S263]]    The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the listed  amendments be called up and reported by number.    Sure.    Sure.    Sure.    Sure.    Sure.    Sure.    Sure.    Sure.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my previous  unanimous consent request be vitiated.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote  in relation to the following amendments in the order listed with all  other provisions of the previous order remaining in effect; further,  that there be no second-degree amendments in order to the amendments  listed: That would be Fischer 184 and Gillibrand 82.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The Senator from Nebraska.                              Amendment No. 184     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to reinstate my  previous unanimous consent which would be: Fischer 184, then Gillibrand  82, Hatch 180, Brown 86; further, that the pending amendments, aside  from these listed, be withdrawn, that no further amendments be in  order, and that following disposition of the Brown amendment, the  Senate vote on adoption of the resolution, as amended, if amended.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    I ask unanimous consent that the list of amendments be  called up and reported by number.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                              Amendment No. 180    The clerk will report the amendment by number.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi], for Mr. Hatch,       proposes an amendment numbered 180.    The amendment is as follows:     (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to   strengthening Social Security and repealing and replacing Obamacare,    which has increased health care costs, raised taxes on middle-class   families, reduced access to high quality care, created disincentives   for work, and caused tens of thousands of Americans to lose coverage     they had and liked, and replacing it with reforms that strengthen       Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program without  prioritizing able-bodied adults over the disabled or children and lead  to patient-centered, step-by-step health reforms that provide access to  quality, affordable private health care coverage for all Americans and     their families by increasing competition, State flexibility, and  individual choice, and safeguarding consumer protections that Americans                                  support)         At the end of title III, add the following:       SEC. 3___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO                     STRENGTHENING SOCIAL SECURITY AND REPEALING AND                     REPLACING OBAMACARE.         The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate       may revise the allocations of a committee or committees,       aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution       for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments,       amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports       relating to strengthening Social Security and repealing and       replacing Obamacare, which may include reforms that       strengthen Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance       Program without prioritizing able-bodied adults over the       disabled or children and lead to step-by-step reforms       providing access to quality, affordable coverage for all       Americans, and safeguarding consumer protections, without       raising new revenue, by the amounts provided in such       legislation for those purposes, provided that such       legislation would not increase the deficit over either the       period of the total of fiscal years 2017 through 2021 or the       period of the total of fiscal years 2017 through 2026.                         Vote on Amendment No. 184    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to  waive.   The yeas and nays have been ordered.   The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk called the roll.    Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Act requires that  amendments to a budget resolution be germane. Since this amendment does  not meet the standard required by budget law, a point of order would  lie.   So I raise a point of order against this amendment under section  305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.    Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Act requires that  amendments to a budget resolution be germane. Since this amendment does  not meet the standard required by budget law, I raise a point of order  against this amendment under section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent there be 2 minutes  of debate, equally divided in the usual form, prior to the vote on  adoption of S. Con. Res. 3.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, the repeal resolution we have been debating  in the Senate this week will complete the first step toward reducing  the Federal Government's role that has prevented Americans from  pursuing affordable and accessible health care that meets their needs  without emptying their wallets. After we complete our repeal work, the  Senate can then vigorously pursue putting the Nation on a more  responsible and sustainable fiscal path and address government's out- of-control spending and mammoth national debt when we begin our work on  the fiscal year 2018 budget.   This resolution will set the stage for true legislative relief from  ObamaCare that Americans have long demanded while ensuring a stable  transition in which those with insurance will not lose access to health  care coverage. This will allow us to move step-by-step on a new set of  reforms, listening carefully to the advice of millions of Americans  affected or as Senator Alexander of Tennessee--the chairman of the  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--put it, the ObamaCare  bridge is collapsing, and we are sending in a rescue team. We will then  build new bridges to better health care, and finally, when these new  bridges are finished, we will close the old bridge.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be  in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the repeal resolution we have been debating  in the Senate this week will complete the first step toward reducing  the Federal Government's role that has prevented Americans from  pursuing affordable and accessible health care that meets their needs  without emptying their wallets. After we complete our repeal work, the  Senate can then vigorously pursue putting the Nation on a more  responsible and sustainable fiscal path and address government's out- of-control spending and a mammoth national debt when we begin our work  on the fiscal year 2018 budget.   I thank my colleagues for their consideration and cooperation for  bringing us to this point, and I thank Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  for his leadership in pushing the Senate to take the first steps to  repair the Nation's broken health care system and to remove Washington  from the equation in order to put control of health care back where it  belongs: with the patients and their families and their doctors.   This commitment to an open, honest, and transparent legislative  process is crucial to helping Congress restore the trust of the  American people.   Thanks, as well, are due to many Members on this side who came and  spoke on the resolution's behalf, who worked with us and each other to  move through the resolution, the debate, the amendments, the votes, the  whole process.   I have enjoyed my partnership with Senator Sanders as we took on new  roles as the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee  last Congress. We have known each other a long time, and we have served  on some of the same Senate committees. I believe he and my colleagues  across the aisle share the same goal of establishing a robust and  affordable health care system for hard-working families. I truly hope  that they will work with us to find common ground that delivers more  choices and lower costs in the weeks and months ahead.   Also, I would like to focus for a moment on some of the staff who  helped lead us here.   I thank the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee,  including my acting staff director, Dan Kowalski; the director of the  budget review and acting deputy staff director, Matt Giroux; the chief  counsel, George Everly; senior budget analysts Peter Warren and Steve  Robinson; budget analysts Greg D'Angelo, Tom Bork, Becky Cole, David  Ditch and Susan Eckerly; and assistant counsels Clint Brown and Thomas  Fuller; outreach director Jim Neill; editor Elizabeth Keys; policy  assistant Kelsie Wendelberger; and communications director Joe  Brenckle.   As well, thanks are due to my personal office staff, especially my  chief of staff, Tara Shaw; my legislative director, Landon Stropko; my  health care policy staff, Elizabeth Schwartz, Alec Hinojosa, and Chris  Lydon; as well as the entire Wyoming team.   I want to pay specific attention to thanking Tara Shaw, who is my  chief  [[Page S273]]  of staff. She has been filling a dual role for some time. She was my  legislative director. We have filled that position now. But she has  been acting as the assistant here on the floor as well and done a  tremendous job of manipulating and coordinating both centers of action.   Now, we have also been supported by the great work of our leadership,  floor, and cloakroom staff. I thank them for their continued good work  and dedication to this institution and the country as a whole. In  particular, I want to thank Sharon Soderstrom, Hazen Marshall, Jane  Lee, and Scott Raab in the leader's office, and Monica Popp, John  Caphuis, and Emily Kirlin in the whip's office, and very especially  Laura Dove and Robert Duncan in the cloakroom.   These folks, as well as my budget team, worked hours over the holiday  break to ensure our success. Without all their work, we would not be  here this evening standing on the verge of passing the Senate's repeal  resolution that will set the stage for true legislative relief from  ObamaCare that Americans have long demanded, while ensuring a stable  transition in which those with insurance will not lose access to health  care coverage.   This will allow us to move step by step on a new set of reforms,  listening carefully to the advice of the millions of Americans who are  affected, a step we left out when we did it previously. Or, as Senator  Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions Committee put it, the ObamaCare bridge is  collapsing, and we are sending in a rescue team. Then we will build  several new bridges to get better health care. Finally, when those  bridges are finished, we will close the old bridge.   After 5 days of consideration, many hours of debate, and numerous  amendments reviewed and voted on, this part of the process can now be  concluded. With that, I ask for the continued support and discussion on  this valuable issue. If people have ideas for what ought to be  included, I hope they will talk to us about them. I hope the American  people will talk to us about the ideas they think need to be included.   There has been a lot of fearmongering, a lot of supposition about  what will happen at the next stage. There were amendments that were put  in about the next stage. Those, of course, wound up being nongermane.  But we have our work cut out for us. We do have to come through now  with a system that will solve the problems for the American people.   I mentioned before that when we started the whole debate on  ObamaCare, there were 30 million people uninsured. Today, there are 28  million people uninsured. I think that the 30 million people was  probably closer to 28 million at that time. One of the differences is  some people who could not get insurance have insurance, and a bunch of  people who had insurance can't afford their insurance, and a bunch of  people who have insurance can't afford their insurance, as you heard  through the debate.   We want all the people who want insurance to be covered, and to be  covered in such a way that they can actually get the treatment. If you  have a $12,000 or $10,000 or $6,000 deductible, that may not happen.   But I thank all of the people who have worked to get us to this  point. Our work is now cut out for us even more so.   I know that we can have a spirit of cooperation and work through  this, or we can use the reconciliation process and do it with 51 votes.  But it is far better if we can find common ground and common solutions  and get the work done.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate  completes its business today, it adjourn until 12:30 p.m., Thursday,  January 12--that would be today; further, that following the prayer and  pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings  be approved to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for  their use later in the day; finally, that following leader remarks, the  Senate be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 1:36 a.m., adjourned until  Thursday, January 12, 2017, at 12:30 p.m.
