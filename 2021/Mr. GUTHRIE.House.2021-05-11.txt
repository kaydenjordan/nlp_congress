 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 433, the Family  Support Services for Addiction Act of 2021, which was introduced by  Representatives Trone and Meuser.   This legislation would establish a grant program for family community  organizations that provide evidence-informed and family-based  approaches to substance use and addiction management.   Family-based approaches have a record of success in substance use  disorder recovery when compared with individual approaches, as they  address several psychosocial dimensions of addiction and strengthen  support networks for affected individuals.  [[Page H2161]]    This legislation would support family community organizations  committed to pursuing evidence-driven interventions for substance use  disorder, reducing the stigma of addiction and strengthening both  families and communities through recovery.   I would like to thank Representatives Trone and Meuser for the hard  work that they have done to put together and to bring this important  bill to the floor.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Madam Speaker, I really appreciate both the leaders of this bill and  the entire House, as we have worked hard together in a bipartisan way  over the years for the opioid abuse and other types of abuse and  recovery efforts. This is an important bill and an additional step in  that direction. We are fighting it, but we still have to continue the  fight. This is an important bill. I support it, and I urge my  colleagues to support it as well.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1475, the Pursuing  Equity in Mental Health Act, sponsored by Representative Watson  Coleman.   This important bill helps address suicide and mental illness in youth  from minority and underserved communities.   Despite improvements in health quality, disparities in mental  healthcare persist. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has  reported that racial and ethnic minority groups in the U.S. are less  likely to have access to mental health services, less likely to use  community mental health services, more likely to use emergency  departments, and more likely to receive lower quality care.   Poor mental healthcare access and quality ultimately contribute to  poor outcomes, including suicide among these populations. These issues  are especially acute in minority youth populations.   This bill would help address these disparities by authorizing grants  targeted at high-poverty communities for culturally and linguistically  appropriate mental health services, supporting mental health  disparities research, studying the impact of smartphones and social  media on adolescents, and reauthorizing the Minority Fellowship Program  to support more students of color entering the mental health workforce.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote for this important initiative,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  the purpose of closing.   Madam Speaker, again, this is a very important issue, and I am glad  we are here today to address it. We need to address it. My hopes and  prayers are, as we move forward with this piece of legislation, we get  the help that communities needed.   I support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H2165]]    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 586, the STANDUP Act  of 2021, which was introduced by Representative Scott Peters and  includes the support of many Members of the House, including Energy and  Commerce Committee colleagues Bilirakis, Blunt Rochester, Upton, and  Tonko.   This legislation helps promote suicide awareness and facilitates  prevention training for students and young Americans. For the last  decade, suicide has been the second leading cause of death for  Americans ages 10 to 24, and the 10th leading cause of overall deaths  in the United States. Tragically, this epidemic has only worsened  during the COVID-19 pandemic.   Suicide is preventable, and initiatives that empower students with  knowledge of the warning signs and resources for prevention are  critical in addressing these trends.   Through this bill, Project AWARE grantees will be empowered to  establish school-based suicide awareness and prevention training  programs, which will improve student awareness of mental health issues  while connecting at-risk individuals to needed health services.   The pandemic has greatly impacted the mental health of all Americans,  which is why it is critical that we continue addressing our Nation's  challenges in preventing youth suicide and promoting the wellness of  all.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, as we were speaking before, this is an  important issue. Suicide affects so many people. There are systems,  there is the ability to become aware. It can be preventable if people  know the right signs to look for. I think the American people  absolutely want to work together to make this happen so we can prevent  this.   I urge all my colleagues to support this piece of legislation. I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 721, the Mental Health Services for  Students Act of 2021, spearheaded by Representative Napolitano.   This bill authorizes the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration Project AWARE grants. These grants support State  educational agencies, in partnership with State mental health agencies,  in increasing awareness of mental health issues among school-aged  youth, providing training for school personnel to detect and respond to  mental health issues and connecting students with behavioral health  issues and their families to needed services.   By supporting partnerships between State and local systems to promote  the healthy development of students, these grants increase access to  mental health services for school-aged youth, ultimately reducing youth  violence, substance use disorder, and suicide.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, as with all the other bills before us  today, it is so important to reach out to our youth and to prevent  suicide and violence as a result of mental health disorders. We all  know, as young as we can reach them, the better.   I support this bill and ask my colleagues to do so. I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2877, the  Behavioral Intervention Guidelines Act of 2021 introduced by  Representatives Ferguson, Burgess, Peters, and Panetta.   This important bill authorizes the Substance Abuse and Mental Health  Services Administration to develop best practices for establishing and  using behavioral intervention teams in elementary schools, secondary  schools, and institutions of higher education.   Behavioral intervention teams are multidisciplinary teams that  support students' mental health and wellness by identifying students  experiencing stress, anxiety, or other behavioral disturbances, and  conducting intervention and outreach to these students to help manage  risk. These teams are already active in some educational settings, such  as Texas Tech and the University of California, Los Angeles.   By acting in a proactive manner to assist students and connect them  with needed resources, behavioral intervention teams help schools  create a safe environment for their students and improve mental health  outcomes in young people.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Ferguson).    Madam Speaker, what we have talked about is that this  creates a safe environment for students. I think all Americans want a  safer environment for all of our students and to improve the mental  health outcomes of young people.   Madam Speaker, that is what this bill focuses on, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1260, the Bipartisan  Solution to Cyclical Violence Act of 2021 introduced by Representative  Ruppersberger and fellow Energy and Commerce Committee member  Kinzinger.   This important legislation would provide Federal grants to hospitals  and trauma centers for intervention services to victims of violent  crime.   Violence in America disproportionately impacts urban and underserved  communities, where poor social determinants of health can contribute to  structural violence.   Hospital-based intervention programs help reduce violence because  they reach high-risk individuals recently admitted to a hospital for  treatment of a serious violent injury. Hospitalization presents an  opportunity when an individual may be open to help to break the cycle  of violence by immediate intervention following the violent incident.   By supporting hospital-based violence intervention programs, this  bill will connect at-risk individuals with local resources that address  underlying risk factors for violence.   I thank Representatives Ruppersberger and Kinzinger for tackling this  challenging issue and for putting forward a meaningful solution to help  address violence in our communities.   Madam Speaker, it is important to break the cycle of violence. Having  someone in a hospital setting who has just been a victim of violence is  a great time to address that.   I think this is the right policy at the right time, and I urge my  colleagues to vote for this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1205, Improving Mental  Health Access from the Emergency Department Act of 2021, sponsored by  Representative Ruiz.   This bill authorizes the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration to award grants to emergency departments for the purpose  of supporting follow-up services to patients that present in the  emergency department in mental health crisis.   According to SAMHSA's National Guidelines for Behavioral Health  Crisis Care, there is a disconnect in the provision of follow-up  services regarding what comes next for patients experiencing a mental  health crisis in the emergency department.   If a patient comes in with appendicitis, the emergency room physician  can call a surgeon. If the patient has a rash, the emergency department  has a roster of dermatologists in clinics; and, in many cases, the  physician can even make an appointment for the patient. These  partnerships don't always exist for mental health illness.   By authorizing grants to support programs that help those treated at  emergency departments expeditiously transition to follow-on care, this  bill will remove barriers to care for those experiencing an acute  mental health crisis, reduce stigma, and ultimately save lives.   Madam Speaker, one of the great things I have learned being a Member  of the House of Representatives is that we have 435 people from all  walks of life and they bring all their life experiences to us and  create some important legislation.   Dr. Ruiz is an emergency room physician. He knows this firsthand. We  are colleagues on the Committee on Energy and Commerce. I know he is  passionate about it because it does save lives if we get people the  assistance they need.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1324, the  Effective Suicide Screening and Assessment in the Emergency Department  Act of 2021, introduced by Representatives Bilirakis, Soto, and  Burgess.   This legislation will authorize the grant program to improve the  identification, screening, assessment, and treatment of patients in  emergency departments who are at risk for suicide.   Consideration of this bill could not come at a more pressing time.  The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic downturn have impacted the  mental health of many Americans. Due to the pandemic, tens of thousands  of additional Americans have died from suicide or substance misuse.   Emergency departments are key locations to intervene and assist those  who may be contemplating suicide. Past research has identified one in  every eight emergency department visits in the United States were  related to a mental health or substance use disorder.   By creating grants for emergency departments to develop policies for  screening those at risk of suicide, and enhancing their post-discharge  care coordination, this bill will improve our frontline providers'  ability to intervene when someone is in crisis, ultimately reducing  deaths from despair during this difficult time.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), my friend.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I would just  say that these series of bills is so important in dealing with the  suicide and prevention, in preventing this tragic epidemic from  becoming a pandemic as well.   Madam Speaker, I urge the support, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1480, the Helping  Emergency Responders Overcome Act, or HERO Act, which was introduced by  Representative Bera, and several Members of this Chamber, including  Energy and Commerce Committee colleagues Burgess, Blunt Rochester,  Kelly, Kuster, and Tonko.   This legislation would create a database at the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention to capture public safety officer suicide  incidences, and studies successful interventions. It would  [[Page H2175]]  also authorize a grant program for peer support and wellness programs  for frontline healthcare workers and fire and emergency medical service  agencies. The bill also directs the Secretary of Health and Human  Services to develop best practices and share resources for addressing  post-traumatic stress in public safety officers.   This legislation is incredibly timely. Emergency workers and doctors  and nurses have been under incredible strain throughout the pandemic.  Losing those who keep us healthy and safe will only make the crisis  worse.   We must ensure that all the heroes across America on the front lines  of healthcare and in law enforcement and public safety have the support  they need to continue working to keep us safe.   Madam Speaker, this being National Police Officer Week, I think it is  Memorial week, it is an important time to do all we can for those in  law enforcement, but also public safety, as this bill addresses, and  those on the front lines in healthcare.   So I encourage us to be in support of those on the front lines, and I  urge a ``yes'' vote. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2862, the Campaign to  Prevent Suicide Act, introduced by Representatives Beyer and Kinzinger.   This bill directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and  the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to  conduct a national suicide prevention education campaign, this includes  promotion of the new 988 number for the National Suicide Prevention  Lifeline.   The bill also helps educate Americans on ways to engage people  showing signs of suicidal behavior, in order to provide them with the  support they need. The bill is desperately needed as we work as a  nation to emerge from an unprecedented health and economic crisis.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to come together here today and  advance this legislation.   Again, this is important in terms of having the 988 number, people  can reach out and have intervention. We know intervention and  prevention and recognition is key to preventing people from committing  suicide.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate my friends, Mr. Beyer and Mr. Kinzinger,  for bringing this forward. I urge its passage.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2981, the  Suicide Prevention Lifeline Improvement Act of 2021, introduced by  Representatives Katko, Napolitano, and Beyer. This legislation will  increase the authorization of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline  program to $50 million a year and ensures funding is available for the  continued operation of the suicide hotline.   When an individual in crisis calls the suicide hotline, they cannot  get a busy signal. This is crucial in this time of economic distress  and social isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. With more  individuals in crisis, more calls will come. We must increase awareness  of this critical resource and make it easier to remember the number. We  must make sure the national suicide hotline is prepared to deal with  those in crisis.  [[Page H2178]]    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Katko).    In closing, Madam Speaker, I appreciate my colleagues  for working very hard on this bill and all the bills for suicide  preservation.   Madam Speaker, I urge its passage, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2955, the  Suicide Prevention Act, spearheaded by Representatives Stewart and  Matsui.   This legislation establishes two grant programs to prevent self-harm  and suicide. The first grant program would train emergency room  personnel in suicide prevention strategies and screening. The bill also  establishes a grant program to enhance data collection and sharing of  suicide information to help save lives.   I thank my colleagues for bringing forward this important  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this  important initiative.   Madam Speaker, seeing no additional speakers, I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R.  768, the Block, Report, And Suspend Shipments Act of 2021, which was  led by my  [[Page H2181]]  Energy and Commerce Committee colleagues, McKinley and Dingell.   This bill addresses an alarming problem that was identified in the  Energy and Commerce Committee's 2018 bipartisan investigation into the  distribution of prescription opioids by wholesale drug distributors.   The committee found that when millions of prescription opioids were  dumped into communities large and small across the country, the  distributors flagged the orders for the DEA, but shipped the orders  anyway--even after notifying the authorities that the orders were  suspicious.                                time  1600    This bill places additional obligations on drug manufacturers and  distributors that discover a controlled substance suspicious order.   In addition to reporting the suspicious order to the DEA, H.R. 768  requires the manufacturer or distributor to exercise due diligence,  decline to fill the order, and provide information to the DEA on the  indicators that led to the belief that filling the order would violate  the Controlled Substances Act.   All stakeholders have important roles to play in preventing substance  use disorders, and it is critical that our pharmaceutical manufacturers  and distributors step up in stopping pill dumping.   I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   My good friend from Michigan thanked the Republican and Democratic  staff. We have gone through a series of bills and have another one to  go, most dealing with substance use disorders, mental health, and  suicide prevention, and all of them brought to the floor in a  bipartisan way. That happens with Members working together, but it also  happens with staff working long hours together. We certainly appreciate  all of them who are here with us on the floor or not on the floor this  afternoon.   This is important. We did an oversight investigation. We did a  committee investigation and saw what seemed to us obvious quantities of  pills being distributed that should be raised to the attention of  people.   I think my friend from Michigan said it best when she said this is  common sense, so we want to make sure we clarify the role of  pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors.   This is a good bill, and I urge its support.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Fairness in Orphan Drug  Exclusivity Act.   The Orphan Drug Act was enacted to incentivize the development of  drugs for rare diseases by giving products that receive an orphan drug  designation 7 years of market exclusivity, meaning a drug produced by  another manufacturer that contains the same active ingredient to treat  the same condition is barred from entering the market during this time.   One way a drug can receive an orphan designation and, subsequently,  market exclusivity is by the manufacturer's demonstration that there is  no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be  recovered. However, we have seen in recent years that some drug  manufacturers, in an effort to block competitors from the market, have  tried to take advantage of a loophole in the law. Existing law allows  an orphan drug designation and market exclusivity to carry forward to  future versions of the same drug without requiring the manufacturer to  demonstrate that the drug has not been, and remains unlikely to be,  profitable.   This legislation will close that loophole, requiring manufacturers to  show there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of research and  development will be covered for each successor drug, while still  preserving incentives for orphan drug development.   We must preserve incentives to innovate while preventing bad actors  from exploiting those incentives to benefit from a national crisis, as  we saw during the opioid epidemic.    While no drug currently benefits from market exclusivity awarded  through this mechanism, I remain concerned about including language  that allows for the retroactive revocation of an incentive through  legislation.   Legislation that sets a precedent of revoking a benefit awarded prior  to enactment creates a slippery slope and could chill innovation if  adopted elsewhere in statute. While this bill itself is narrowly  tailored, we do not want uncertainty caused by Congress retroactively  legislating to discourage truly innovative drugs from coming to the  [[Page H2183]]  market, especially for the rare disease community.   However, I will support this bill as it moves forward today as I  believe it is important to prevent the abuse of this program in the  future. I look forward to continuing discussions to come to a  resolution on this outstanding concern as we work with the Senate to  get this bill to the President's desk.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Madam Speaker, it is so important that we have the Orphan Drug Act.  We have so many people who have rare diseases come to our offices and  visit us on Capitol Hill, as they should. Hopefully we will be able to  do that again soon. It just touches your heart. Many of these diseases  have so few people affected by it; but if it is you or your child or  somebody in your family, it is devastating.   We have all seen the power of the private marketplace to come in and  produce these pharmaceuticals that make a difference. So we have to  have provisions to allow these drugs to come into the marketplace and  incentivize that private innovation moving forward.   But when people use that in order to move forward, this loophole has  to be closed. I am glad that it is here, and it is these things that we  need to work on. It is really not specifically here; it is just maybe a  slippery slope in other places as we move forward.   I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for bringing this forward, and  the Energy and Commerce Committee for addressing this, because we have  to preserve orphan drug status for those afflicted by the rarest and  the most devastating diseases. We also need to bring lower drug prices  to Americans, and we can do that working together.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate this being brought forward. I urge my  colleagues to support this piece of legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
