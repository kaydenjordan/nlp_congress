 Mr. Speaker, last week the House passed H.R. 1, the For  the People Act, a sweeping voting rights and government reform package  that returns the power of our democracy to the American people.   Since this week is Sunshine Week, I want to focus on a particular  part of H.R. 1 that is designed to shine some much-needed sunshine on  the corrosive influence of dark money.   Multiple sources reported this week that the President's 2017  inaugural fund received tens of thousands of dollars in contributions  from shell companies to conceal illegal contributions from foreign  donors.   Think about that. Foreign agents lavished tens of thousands of  dollars on the U.S. inaugural celebration so they could try to  influence our President.   That is why I introduced the Inaugural Fund Integrity Act, which is  part of H.R. 1, to close loopholes in the existing regulations, to put  an end to donations by foreign nationals and corporations, to ban  personal use of inaugural funds, and to require disclosure of all  donations and spending by inaugural committees.   It is hard to think of an area more in need of sunshine than a  shadowy slush fund rife with opportunities for government corruption.                            ____________________
