 Madam Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.J.  Res. 79, which will remove a deadline for the ratification of the Equal  Rights Amendment. This will ensure that our country fully accepts the  impact of the recent ratifications by the states of Nevada, Illinois,  and Virginia.   The Equal Rights Amendment represents the further advancement of  women in our society. It enshrines the American ideal that ``equality  of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United  States or any State on account of sex''. While other existing statutes  have been interpreted as prohibiting some forms of sex discrimination,  there are still numerous avenues in which they are inefficient for the  full protection of women under the law.   As representatives of communities across our nation, we must set an  explicit example of our championing of women's rights. Women continue  to face obstacles to their full equality, including through unequal  pay, pregnancy discrimination, sexual and domestic violence, and  inadequate access to health care services. As the United States, we  must be mindful of the global influence we have, and we must ensure  that gender equality is, without a doubt, enshrined in our foundational  principles.   The bipartisan support of this legislation captures the will of  Americans for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.  Therefore, I am proud to support this resolution as a crucial step  forward for gender equality.
