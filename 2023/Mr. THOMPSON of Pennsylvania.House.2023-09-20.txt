 Madam Speaker, this week is Gold Star  Family Remembrance Week. Every September, Gold Star Family Remembrance  Week takes place on the week leading up to Gold Star Mother's Day,  which has been observed by Presidential proclamation since 1936 on the  last Sunday of September.   The Gold Star symbol first originated in 1917 when the United States  began its involvement in World War I. Families would hang banners to  represent a family member in the armed services. If the family member  died in combat, the family would change the banner from a blue star to  a gold star.   We will never know the exact number of Gold Star families. However,  accordingly to the National Gold Star Family Registry, at least 472,251  fallen military members are registered by loved ones. At least 36,548  of those servicemembers have been registered in my home State of  Pennsylvania.   As an Army dad, I am blessed my son returned home. I am aware that  this is not the case for all families, and we must take the time to  remember, respect, and honor the families of our fallen servicemembers.   To honor and remember our fallen servicemembers and their families, I  look forward to supporting efforts such as the Gold Star Family  Remembrance Week. This week recognizes the loss and sacrifices of  families in support of fallen members of the Armed Forces, as well as  veterans.   I look forward to supporting legislative efforts to honor this  occasion and encourage fellow Americans to perform acts of community  service and goodwill to honor these families.   Our servicemembers are the bravest among us. They answer the call to  protect and defend our Nation in times of war and in times of peace.   This important week is a time to remember the families of the brave  men and women who paid the ultimate sacrifice while defending our  freedom.   Madam Speaker, let us take a moment to remember that our freedom is  not free. We cannot begin to imagine the loss and pain that these  families have experienced.   Gold Star families have lost a loved one in the name of protecting  our freedom, and they deserve our gratitude every day.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the McClure Bean Soup Festival. Over the weekend, I attended the 132nd  McClure Bean Soup Festival in Snyder County, Pennsylvania's 15th  Congressional District.   This annual celebration started when Captain Michael Smith and  several other surviving Civil War veterans wanted to host a reunion  with other veterans, and it has now grown into a weeklong fair.   Supposedly, Captain Smith and his comrades basically had beans and  some ham and, therefore, decided to provide bean soup for all their  comrades who were attending that reunion. Today, this fair has vendors,  rides, and games, but the biggest attraction is the bean soup.   Last year, volunteers made more than 30 kettles, and, yes, the recipe  has stayed the same for more than 130 years.   Mr. Speaker, this weeklong festival is a staple in the Snyder County  community. It is a unique way to remember the veterans of the Civil War  while building memories within the community.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to next year's McClure Bean Soup Festival  as well.                            ____________________
