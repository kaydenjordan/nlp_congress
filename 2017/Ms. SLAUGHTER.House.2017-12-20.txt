 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding me the customary 30  minutes.   Mr. Speaker, it seems like only yesterday we were here. Does it not?   Mr. Speaker, we are 5 days away from Christmas, but it feels like  Groundhog Day. Less than 24 hours ago, the majority stood in the  Chamber and passed its partisan bill to provide tax cuts for  millionaires, billionaires, and one President.   Speaker Ryan called it a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but,  apparently, by a twist of fate, he is getting that great opportunity  again today, much sooner, I am sure, than he anticipated, because we  are taking the bill up again this morning.    Maybe in the mad dash to provide massive tax breaks for corporations  and the 1 percent, the majority failed to do the due diligence and  properly vet the bill.   We found out, after it passed, that several of its provisions  violated the Byrd rule in the Senate. Now, everybody knows about the  Byrd rule in the Senate, and I don't understand why this was not found  in the conference that was held for maybe 30 minutes.   This is the rule that prohibits the Senate from considering  extraneous matters as part of a reconciliation bill.   After passing the House, provisions in this bill governing 529  college savings accounts and exempting certain universities from an  excise tax were ruled out of order by the Senate Parliamentarian. The  bill was so rushed that even the title of H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act, was found to be a violation. Let me repeat that. The very first  words of the bill didn't pass muster with a nonpartisan rule keeper in  the Senate. Imagine what other areas we have yet to discover.   This is a consequence of a process that was nothing short of an  abomination. There were zero hearings on the text of this bill. Not a  single expert was called in to give his or her experience. It got the  votes to pass only after a series of closed-door, backroom dealings,  and a conference committee between the House and Senate Republicans.  Well, I think there were some Democrats there, but they tell me that  none of them signed the conference report. The Senate was such a sham  that an agreement was reached before the first public meeting ever took  place.   Now, I know this is not the last time, Mr. Speaker, we will meet here  to try to fix this bill. Mark my words, we will be back here next year  to make more so-called technical fixes because of this hasty  consideration.   The majority is rushing to pass a bill that is historically  unpopular, clearly deeply flawed, and we will be forced to clean up its  impacts and unintended consequences for many years to come.   I think we have all got a second opportunity here, and I would wish  that my friends, to whom I only wish well, would grab up all their  papers and run for the door and forget about this tax bill altogether.  But I know that that wish will not come true.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  the State of Washington (Ms. DelBene).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to say to my  friend from Georgia that it wasn't Democrats who found that. The  Parliamentarian in the Senate found those errors, and they had to be  corrected. Let's put history in the right perspective.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett), who is the distinguished ranking member of the Ways and Means  Subcommittee on Tax Policy.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an  additional 2 minutes.  [[Page H10256]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Trump White House released a National Security  Strategy Report on Monday, and it pointed out: ``The national debt, now  over $20 trillion, presents a grave threat to America's long-term  prosperity and, by extension, our national security.''   So what do we do about that? We are going to add $1.5 trillion more.   The overwhelming majority of expert analyses show that, even with  growth taken into account, this bill will cause the deficit to  skyrocket. It isn't just a threat to our economic security. According  to the White House, it is a grave threat to our national security as  well.   The bill in front of us costs $1.5 trillion and includes permanent  tax cuts for corporations, but temporary ones for individuals.                                time  1100    So who do you think is going to lose those first?   It is really very troubling, I think, too: the idea of looking ahead  to what we are going to be dealt with. And we understand already that  next year the cry will be: Oh, look at this debt. This is awful. We are  going to have to cut spending.   Entitlements will be the place where the Republicans prefer to go.   So let's prepare all of our senior citizens on Social Security,  Medicare, and Medicaid. Of course, that also hurts the ACA, that they  are going to be on the line next year.   Future Congresses will be pressured to reject the budget gimmick and  extend many of those tax cuts, meaning the true cost of the bill is  much higher.   According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal  Budget, the expirations and delays hide potential further costs, which  could ultimately increase the cost of the bill to $2.2 trillion.   I am sure that my Republican colleagues will argue that growth will  prevent the deficit from skyrocketing. But the CRFB reports that even  with dynamic scoring, the total cost of the bill without budgetary  gimmicks would be over $1.6 trillion and up to $2 trillion with  interest. And that takes growth into account. As a result, our debt  could exceed the size of our economy by 2027.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Committee for a Responsible  Federal Budget's analysis, entitled ``Final Tax Bill Could End Up  Costing $2.2 Trillion.'    [From the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Dec. 18, 2017]             Final Tax Bill Could End Tip Costing $2.2 Trillion         The final conference committee agreement of the Tax Cuts       and Jobs Act (TCJA) would cost $1.46 trillion under       conventional scoring and over $1 trillion on a dynamic basis       over ten years, leading debt to rise to between 95 percent       and 98 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2027       (compared to 91 percent under current law). However, the bill       also includes a number of expirations and long-delayed tax       hikes meant to reduce the official cost of the bill. These       expirations and delays hide $570 billion to $725 billion of       potential further costs, which could ultimately increase the       cost of the bill to $2.0 trillion to $2.2 trillion (before       interest) on a conventional basis or roughly $1.5 trillion to       $1.7 trillion on a dynamic basis over a decade. As a result,       debt would rise to between 98 percent and 100 percent of GDP       by 2027.        Ignoring the expirations in this bill is particularly       disingenuous given the claim that using a ``current policy       baseline'' reduces the bill's costs. The (flawed) idea is       that the bill should be compared to a current policy baseline       that counts expired and expiring provisions as if they are       continued permanently. (For more on this, see Current Policy       Gimmick Would Add Half-Trillion to Debt (http://www.crfb.org/ blogs/current-policy-gimmick-would-add-half-trillion-debt)).       Using such a construct does not make sense if cost of       continuing future expirations contained in the bill are not       included in the initial cost estimate. Policymakers are       effectively claiming $450 billion of current policy savings       while ignoring over $700 billion of current policy costs.        This latest estimate updates our tally of the gimmicks from       a previous version of the bill (http://www.crfb.org/blogs/ senate-tax-bill-could-ultimately-cost-2-trillion). The       changes made in conference include both tax increases and       decreases that mostly offset each other, with a net increase       in the ten-year cost of $9 billion (compared to the Senate       bill). With these changes, the bill now has a total cost of       $1.46 trillion, or roughly $1.77 trillion with interest.       While there is no new dynamic score of the bill, assuming it       continues to produce very roughly $400 billion of dynamic       feedback (http://www.crfb.org/blogs/official-dynamic-score- shows-senate-tax-bill-will-still-cost-over-1-trillion) would       reduce that cost to about $1.05 trillion, or roughly $1.30       trillion with interest.        However, this cost does not account for as much as $725       billion of potential gimmicks that the conferenced bill       contains.        In the earlier version passed by the Senate, we identified       $585 billion (http://www.crfb.org/blogs/senate-tax-bill- could-ultimately-cost-2-trillion) of arbitrary sunsets and       sunrises of certain provisions. Most significantly, nearly       all of the individual income tax provisions would have       expired after 2025. Additionally, the expensing provisions       ``bonus depreciation'' began to phase down starting in 2022,       and a number of new tax increases appeared in 2026. Some       provisions were set to expire even earlier, such as an       expanded deduction for medical expenses and provisions for       craft beer and paid leave--clearly setting the stage for       future extensions.        The conferenced bill adds to the Senate bill's gimmicks,       which we explain here (http://www.crfb.org/blogs/senate-tax- bill-could-ultimately-cost-2-trillion). Most significantly,       it advances the start date of the bill's requirement for       research expenses to be amortized, which nearly doubles the       ten-year savings of the provision. Additionally, the bill       tightens its limits on the business interest deduction four       years in the future--a future tax hike that may not be       allowed to ever occur. Other changes are smaller and move in       both directions.        Adding these gimmicks to the cost of the bill would       increase the total cost to $2.0 trillion to $2.2 trillion.       Though the dynamic effect of making the bill permanent is       unknown, we estimate a permanent bill would produce roughly       $450 billion of feedback, leading to a dynamic cost of       roughly $1.6 trillion to $1.7 trillion. With interest, these       costs would rise to $2.4 trillion to $2.5 trillion, or $1.9       trillion to $2 trillion with dynamic effects included, over a       decade.                        TRUE COST OF CONFERENCE BILL ------------------------------------------------------------------------                      Policy                           Ten-Year Cost ------------------------------------------------------------------------ TCJA as reported by the conference committee...           $1.46 trillion Sunsetting individual tax provisions after 2025             $315 billion Amortizing Research & Experimentation (R&E)                 $120 billion  expenses after 2021........................... Phasing out full expensing after 2022..........         $0 to 80 billion Making business interest deduction more strict         $0 to $75 billion  after 2021.................................... Making foreign tax provisions more strict after              $50 billion  2025.......................................... Sunsetting more generous medical expense                     $45 billion  deduction after 2018.......................... Sunsetting credit for employers who offer paid               $30 billion  leave after 2019.............................. Sunsetting craft beverage tax reforms..........              $10 billion Conventional ``Real'' Cost.....................       $2.0-$2.2 trillion Potential Dynamic Feedback Effects.............            -$450 billion Dynamic ``Real Cost''..........................       $1.6-$1.7 trillion True Cost with Interest........................        $2.4-2.5 trillion True Cost with Interest and Dynamic Effects....        $1.9-2.0 trillion ------------------------------------------------------------------------         As is, the bill would cause debt to increase from 77       percent of GDP this year to 95 percent or 98 percent of GDP       by 2027, depending on whether dynamic effects are included,       as compared to 91 percent projected under current law. If       expiring provisions are extended and late-stage tax hikes       avoided, debt could reach as high as 98 percent or 100       percent of GDP by 2027. In other words, the national debt       could exceed the size of the economy.     Mr. Speaker, we have urgent spending needs. This bill  could keep us from dealing with infrastructure, education, healthcare,  medical research, and, of course, we have to pay the costs of our  military.   Make no mistake, exploding the deficit to pay for this bill--this  giveaway to the rich--will come at the expense of all of those  priorities.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am not surprised that we are back here fixing the  bill, though I am surprised it is so soon, because we have been saying  all along that we have got a long way to go with this bill.   If we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment  that will prohibit any legislation from being considered on the House  floor that limits or repeals the State and local tax deduction, or  repeals the ACA's individual mandate.   We know that repealing the individual mandate will lead to 13 million  fewer Americans with health insurance and will cost premiums to rise by  10 percent. Now, I know that not giving healthcare is not much of an  issue for the majority of this Congress because they have been trying  to do that for a long time.   The bill also caps the State and local tax deduction, hurting  taxpayers in my home State of New York, in California, and in other  States in the Northeast, all of whom are donor States. My own State  sends $48 billion a year to Washington, money that we get back nothing  for. But we are not going to be able to do that anymore without this  deduction. What we are doing then is risking the stability of the  revenues that fund the public schools, fire departments, and hospitals  in those States.   Mr. Speaker, let's make things right and defeat the previous  question.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the majority is clearly unable to responsibly run the  House of Representatives, because here we are fixing the bill less than  24 hours after it was passed.   It is a perfect example of why we need to go back to regular order:  actually holding hearings, have expert witnesses and testimony, and  properly vet bills.   That is pretty elementary, but it surely is true. It is especially  true for bills of this magnitude that will effect every single citizen  in America.   All the while, the government is about to run out of money, and we  haven't even been able to reach a budget deal. That is Friday that the  government will close if we do not do that.   We still haven't funded the Children's Health Insurance Program,  which provides needed healthcare to more than 9 million children.   We haven't reauthorized the community health centers, which serve  more than 25 million people.   We haven't renewed the Perkins Loan Program, which many low-income  students rely on for their education.    All of those programs expired back on September 30.   But here we are, wasting valuable time trying to fix the disaster of  a bill that the majority passed just hours ago. It is embarrassing and  it is humiliating. If we don't do better, the public is going to make  us pay the price.   I want to close by quoting an article that appeared this morning in  The Washington Post, written by a great columnist, Dana Milbank. I  wouldn't miss his writing for the world.   ``Maybe he is right and all those blue-chip economists and the  nonpartisan analyses by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the  Congressional Budget Office, and others are wrong. Maybe growth will  dramatically exceed forecasts, millions will enter the labor force and  find work, wages will soar, and the $1.5 trillion tax bill will pay for  itself. But if all that doesn't happen, the Trump tax will be blamed.''   Mr. Speaker, I end the quote there, reminding you, as Senator Schumer  did yesterday, that this could be an anchor around your ankles for the  rest of your lives.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, on the  rule, and the bill. For heaven's sake, let us take this opportunity  given us and not force this onto the American public.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
