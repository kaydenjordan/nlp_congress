 Madam Speaker, a point of clarification, are we doing  Special Orders or 1 minutes?   I think there is a time set aside every day for Special Orders.    Madam Speaker, I stand today to pay tribute to David  Trimble, an important contributor to the formation and the success of  the Good Friday Agreement and the original First Minister for Northern  Ireland. I got to know David very well, and it is unfortunate that he  has left us too early.   All of the political parties in the North put aside longstanding  animosities and came together to make the Good Friday Agreement  possible. David Trimble showed uncommon courage to ignore dissenting  voices in the Unionist community to achieve that historic accord.   For all of us, sometimes it is difficult to say no to our own side.  It was not an easy process. There were many months of negotiations, and  not everybody got what they wanted, but the Nobel Prize that he and  John Hume received in 1998 was a reflection of those tough decisions.  As we approach the 25th anniversary of the agreement, it endures  because of his patient approach, coupled with a keen focus on dialogue.   My deepest condolences to his wife, Daphne, and family. Today, we  know that on the island of Ireland, peace is within our sight because  of the work that David Trimble contributed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for her good work.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the CHIPS and Science Act. We are  here to put people over political discussions by lowering costs,  creating jobs, and supercharging our domestic manufacturing.   Our domestic manufacturing from time to time has lagged; and in this  legislation, we will reinvigorate our chip production nationwide.   Through sensible tax credits, we will incentivize further research  and development and bring 100,000 good-paying jobs to the American  family.   I don't understand how the other side can be opposed to this. This is  an argument about national security. That is what this is about when  everything is pushed back. We have this opportunity here to put aside  the theatrical discussion and proceed with sensible, substantive  legislation.   Let's get on voting for this CHIPS and Science Act.
