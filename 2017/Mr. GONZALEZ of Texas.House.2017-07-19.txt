 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2883,  the Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act.   This bill would enact crucial reforms allowing efficient trade of  energy products with our North American friends and allies.  Unfortunately, the existing process has politicized vital cross-border  energy infrastructure.   H.R. 2883 offers a narrowly crafted, sensible solution to this  problem. The bill will create a process at the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission, State Department, and the Department of Energy  to permit cross-border infrastructure projects.   This new procedure will bring regulatory certainty while ensuring  these projects are environmentally sound and within public interest.  These projects create jobs in my district in south Texas and across the  country.   I congratulate and thank Mr. Green and Mr. Mullin for this important  piece of legislation. Energy security, targeted regulatory reforms, and  smart infrastructure investments are things we can all support, and we  should all support.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this sensible bipartisan  legislation.
