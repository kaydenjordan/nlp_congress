 Madam Chair, to save lives and make our  community safer, I rise in support of the HALT Fentanyl Act.   Illicit fentanyl is one of the greatest threats that we face as a  nation. Illicit drug manufacturers are diverting precursor chemicals  from some of China's 160,000 chemical plants and shipping them to  Mexico, where cartels are producing mass quantities of illicit fentanyl  and fentanyl-related substances. These are being smuggled across our  southern border and killing more people than ever.   According to an analysis by The Washington Post, fentanyl poisoning  is the number one cause of death for people 18 to 49.   I think about my friend Molly Cain from Spokane, who lost her son  Carson, and Deb and Ray Cullen from Pennsylvania, who lost their son  Zach. Both Carson and Zach were killed instantly by substances laced  with illicit fentanyl.   Molly asked me how many more letters from grieving parents is it  going to take for action.   The fact is it shouldn't take another letter, another day. It  shouldn't take another lost loved one.   The HALT Fentanyl Act will save lives.   We must make sure that law enforcement has the permanent tools that  they need to seize these extremely lethal poisons. It is DEA's number  one priority. Without these tools, drug traffickers being sourced from  China will be emboldened to push deadlier and deadlier drugs across the  border. We can't let that happen.   Let's come together today for a more secure future for every  community in America.   Madam Chair, I urge support of the HALT Fentanyl Act.
