 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Lauren  Emerson from Rapides High School for being recognized as one of the top  20 ag teachers in the Nation by the National Association of  Agricultural Educators.   Lauren's students come into her classroom with a strong background in  agriculture, and she provides hands-on lessons that provoke meaningful  connections between the curriculum and their work at home to help take  their learning to the next level.   Her students can earn industry certifications and dual credit by  enrolling in her agricultural courses. She helps develop her students'  leadership skills through the National FFA Organization, skills they  need to move forward with higher levels of education, postgraduate  education, and just for life.   To borrow from the FFA creed, I, too, believe in the future of  agriculture because of educators like Lauren Emerson who are leading  the next generation of agriculturalists. The Fifth District is proud to  recognize Ms. Emerson for all she is doing for her ag students.
