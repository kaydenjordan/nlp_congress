 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 6 and the foster  youth who will benefit from its passage.   One of the most popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act allows  young adults to stay on their parents' health insurance until they turn  26. It is only fair that young adults who age out of foster care should  keep their coverage until they turn 26, too.   But when the ACA was implemented, the Department of Health and Human  Services gave States the option of covering young adults who aged out  of foster care in a different State. For example, if a young adult aged  out of the system at 18 and had coverage in California but then moved  to New York, New York would have the option to cover them under  Medicaid until they turned 26 or not.   This extended coverage was never supposed to be optional. After all,  former foster youth should have every opportunity to move freely  without the fear of losing lifesaving health insurance. This is why I  introduced the Health Insurance for Former Foster Youth Act.   Last month, over 100 former foster youth were on the Hill and  shadowed their Members of Congress. We celebrated that many of the  young adults had been accepted to college, some out of State. This bill  will ensure that when former foster youth age out of the system, they  can keep their healthcare coverage until 26, no matter where they live.   This is about fairness. Former foster youth should be treated the  same way we treat all young people.   I am grateful to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for  including my bill in this bipartisan opioid package.   Just this week, The Hill reported the States hardest hit by the  opioid epidemic have seen the number of children in foster care or  State care increase dramatically.   Again, I thank my colleagues for working with me to clarify this law,  and I thank Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone for their  leadership on this issue.
