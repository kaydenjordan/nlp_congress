 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the REINS Act,  H.R. 26, for any number of reasons.   I can't help but point out that I have heard my esteemed colleagues  in opposition to this bill refer on multiple occasions to the Federal  bureaucracy as a well-oiled machine. Mr. Chairman, there are, indeed,  well-oiled machines that undergird this institution, but I would submit  the Federal bureaucracy is not one of those.   We have heard that the regulatory burden, as it relates to the loss  of jobs, is equal to a listeria outbreak. What I would submit is that  if we could avoid a listeria outbreak, would we not choose to do just  that?  [[Page H130]]                                     time  1530    While looking at the loss of jobs as related to Federal regulation,  we overstep the argument by avoiding the jobs not created as a result  of Federal regulations. Should these things also not be amongst the  items that we consider?   A wise man once said that the bureaucracy will continue to expand to  meet the expanding needs of the bureaucracy. In 2017, in the United  States, indeed, it seems we find ourselves in that very situation.   Arguments that the REINS Act is contrary to the Constitution, I would  submit, are actually 180 degrees from the truth. In fact, Article I of  the Constitution gives the power to make law to this legislative branch  of our government and gives the power to generate revenue, here, as  well as spend.   The definition of ``law,'' according to the Oxford Dictionary, is:  ``The system of rules which a particular country or community  recognizes as regulating the actions of its members and which it may  enforce by the imposition of penalties.''   I will submit that the very regulatory overreach that we consider  here today is, in fact, tantamount to law and extraconstitutional in  and of itself.   My esteemed colleague from Pennsylvania suggested, and I agree, that  the REINS Act is but a good start. The power to spend is Article I. The  power to make laws is Article I.   REINS is a rudder on the ship of constitutionality that will right  that ship and move it only in the correct direction. Regulations that  have the power to take liberty or property rights or the wealth of  those earned by their own labor are tantamount to law and, indeed,  extraordinary constitutionally as it relates to an executive branch  entity, and they should not be exercised.   Mr. Chairman, we hear that the people's House is responsible for this  and the people's House is responsible for that. Well, the people's  House is to ensure that the people have a voice in the matters of  spending and lawmaking that our Founders who laid out Article I of the  Constitution envisioned, and currently, that is simply not the case.  H.R. 26 is simply a step back towards that right direction of  constitutionality.   With that in mind, I strongly support the legislation.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter), my friend.
