 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I got buoyed in a little  dance step in my walk, not because of partisan politics, but because  people in America voted. They voted throughout the Nation and they made  sizeable changes, not even on partisan politics, but what I love, about  principles. Principles of rejecting divisiveness, the misinterpretation  of the Constitution, and the wonderment of this Nation is what these  voters stood for.   I also believe they recognize that they wanted direction that really  worked for them. If we pass the tax bill, they didn't want it to be a  tax scam where millions of middle class Americans would pay an increase  in taxes or they couldn't deduct their medical expenses or student  interest rates.   The vote yesterday was for a new direction, not for any of us to take  it for granted, but for us to recognize that it is time now for the  American people to lead. I am so grateful for the democracy of this  Nation and for the values of the American people. They made a  difference yesterday. Thank you for voting.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, let me give my greatest appreciation to  the gentleman from New York, who will remain at the podium as he has  yielded to me, and to thank him for the leadership that he has given to  so many issues.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for the leadership work  that he took to Puerto Rico that will need housing, and the U.S. Virgin  Islands that will need housing. The neighborhoods that he has just  mentioned, I am quite familiar with. I know those neighborhoods in New  York. I have relatives in New York.   But I also know the neighborhoods in Texas, and I know the public  housing developments. I want to join the gentleman in that terminology  because, remember, it used to be the projects. But we know that public  housing developments are where people live. It is where they raise  their children. When you have a home in the public housing development,  it needs maintenance, elevators, window reinforcement, hallways cleaned  up, painting done, and, yes, debugging, and brick-by-brick repair, or  it may be a new addition.   All of my life, I have met my classmates in public, elementary, and  middle school, and they live in the housing developments, many of whom  I could go back to, and they are doctors, lawyers, teachers, business  persons, and Congresspersons. They are upstanding citizens. But we also  know that they have said to us that you have allowed these public  housing developments to deteriorate so that children of families who  live there now may be subjected to violence and drugs, and it is not  their home.   Let me tell you why we are in that predicament.   Right now, as we speak, they are marking up the tax scam. If you look  at this pie, you will see that it will be impossible for any moneys to  go for public housing or affordable housing because 80 percent of the  tax cuts will go to the 1 percent. That means that we will lose $1.5  trillion in revenue.   What Congressman Espaillat is talking about is that we will be losing  and will not be able--as the budget that was passed evidences with $2.4  trillion in cuts in domestic discretionary spending, it will not allow  the work that we are calling for today: reconstruction, new build,  rehab, repairs, and adding to the housing stock in America for our  people who are in need.   Let me show you this. It may not be exactly in our neighborhood, but  it shows you what happened in a disaster. This is a house, or a place  where people would be in a house. I could go to Texas after  Hurricane Harvey and find houses in this condition. I could go to Port  Aransas or Rockport. I can go to Third Ward or northeast Houston.    In our community, Mr. Speaker, we have what we call blue tarps after  the hurricane, and they stay on because people are in houses that they  cannot afford to repair. They need affordable housing.   Do you know what? They want to live in historic neighborhoods like  Fifth Ward where Barbara Jordan grew up, Sunnyside, South Park, Third  Ward, Acres Homes, northeast Houston, and Independence Heights, but  they need housing.   So I join the gentleman in saying that this is a travesty. This is a  disgrace. We need funding for affordable housing. Hurricane Harvey has  made it even more disastrous because there are people in housing now  right in my district--and I hear you in northeast Houston where the  walls are pulled out and the mold is on because they need affordable  housing. They need Section 8 vouchers and clean housing.   Mr. Speaker, let me tell you about the affordable housing and public  housing. I have lost 112 units through Hurricane Harvey in  condemnation, and I may lose more out of a total of 201 in one  particular two-story area of Clayton Homes; and then 2100 Memorial, we  are fighting to not lose the housing that is needed there.   So I want to join and thank the Congressional Progressive Caucus and  thank the gentleman for leading this Special Order. I want to make sure  that I keep this picture up for America to know that unless we fight  against these dastardly cuts, whether you are in a disaster area and  have lost your home; or whether you are in a city like New York and are  facing the deterioration of public housing, or the elimination of units  taken offline; or whether you are in Houston, Texas, under the Houston  Housing Authority and you are losing units, the cry is for the families  of America.   Who do we care for? Some of them are families of Active-Duty  soldiers. Some of them are families of veterans. So I would join the  gentleman in crafting and working on stopping the bleeding of losing  affordable housing for the many millions of Americans who need it and  welcome it, and for the millions of children who deserve it.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me, and I thank  him again for his leadership.
