 Madam Speaker, I rise today as COVID cases surge  in my home State of Nevada and across this country.   In fact, in the past 3 days, Nevada has added over 2,000 new cases,  and our 2-week positivity rate has rapidly grown to more than 12  percent. Hospitalizations are up, too, with the vast majority being  among, you guessed it, the unvaccinated.   Unfortunately, just over half of Nevadans are fully or partially  vaccinated. We must all do our part to end this pandemic. The best  thing you can do to protect yourself, your family, the ones you care  about most is to get vaccinated.   Getting your vaccine is safe and, now, easier than ever. Believe it  or not, back home in Nevada, it comes with the chance to win more than  $5 million in prizes. That is how desperate we are to make sure that  everyone is motivated to go get a vaccine.   Please, go to vaccines.gov to find a clinic. For those who are  already vaccinated, please take the time this week to reach out and  encourage your peers to do their part, too.   Together, we can stop the spread and get our lives back to normal.                            ____________________
