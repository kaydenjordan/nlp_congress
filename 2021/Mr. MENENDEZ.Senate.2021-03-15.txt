 Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export  Control Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of  certain proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such  notification, the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale  may be reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

The total estimated program cost is $1.77 billion.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by improving the       security of a NATO Ally which is an important force for       political and economic stability in Europe.        The proposed sale will improve Germany's capability to meet       current and future threats by providing critical capabilities       to coalition maritime operations. Germany currently operates       the Lockheed P-3C Orion, but that aircraft is reaching end-      of-life and will retire in 2024. Germany plans to replace it       with the P-8A Poseidon. The proposed sale will allow Germany       to modernize and sustain its Maritime Surveillance Aircraft       (MSA) capability for the next 30 years. Germany will have no       difficulty transitioning its MSA force to P-8 and absorbing       these aircraft into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractor will be The Boeing Company, Seattle,       WA. There are no known offset agreements proposed in       connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of the proposed sale will require the       assignment of four (4) U.S. Government and four (4)       contractor representatives to Germany for a duration of two       (2) years to support equipment familiarization, training and       supply support.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.
