 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, this is, indeed, a sad  day for our country. This is, indeed, a sad day for America. But it is  a good day for our Constitution.   It is a sad day for our country because President Trump has defied  our Constitution, our rules, our requirements, and our expectations.   It is clear that President Trump places himself above the law, above  our Constitution, and above the expectations of the American people.   At my last townhall meeting, which was held Saturday, December 15, at  Malcolm X College in Chicago, someone asked the question: What is our  position on impeachment?   Madam Speaker, every person there rose and said: Impeach.   When I speak, I speak for the people of the Seventh District of  Illinois, and my vote will be impeach, impeach, impeach.
