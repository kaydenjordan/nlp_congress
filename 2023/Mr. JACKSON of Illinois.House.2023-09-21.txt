 Madam Speaker, I rise today to stand in  solidarity with our United Auto Workers brothers and sisters.   Only 2 weeks before his assassination, Reverend Martin Luther King  was in Memphis and supported the city sanitation workers' strike. To  the crowd, he proclaimed that ``now is the time.''   I echo Reverend Martin Luther King's words from the people's Chamber  and say unto UAW auto workers: Now is the time.   Number one, now is the time for a cost-of-living adjustment. In real  terms, worker wages are more than 10 percent less than they were in  2019, despite rising costs.   Now is the time for an end to tiered employment in the automotive  industry. Workers are making different wages doing equal work. This is  simply unacceptable. The only difference between them is which labor  contract was in force on the day that they started.   Now is the time for job security. As we transition away from  combustion engines, these jobs need to stay in America and remain good- paying union jobs.   Now is the time for a cost-of-living adjustment. Now is the time to  end tiered employment pay. Now is the time for job security.   I stand in solidarity with the UAW.                            ____________________
