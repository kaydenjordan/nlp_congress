 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, as a doctor, I know that understanding and  managing infectious diseases is one of the most important parts of our  security and our national security. The intelligence community has  found that a country's health is directly linked to their stability and  their well-being. We are reminded of this every few years through mass  pandemics that are not going away.   In 2014, we saw the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and just 2 years  ago, we witnessed the Zika outbreak in Central and South America. And,  unfortunately, as a doctor, I know we are going to continue to see  these and other diseases again and again, and we need to be prepared.   So we offer this amendment as a way of getting the intelligence  community to help us with that preparedness, to inform us and make sure  we are not just protecting lives overseas, but we are also protecting  our national interests and our national security.   Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Schiff), the ranking member.    Mr. Chairman, I have no additional comments, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
