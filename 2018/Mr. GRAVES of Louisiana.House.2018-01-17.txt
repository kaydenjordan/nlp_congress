 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Smith for  his leadership in this effort for so many decades.   Mr. Speaker, we spend millions of dollars every year in this Nation-- in fact, in some cases, billions of dollars--providing healthcare for  Americans, feeding Americans, providing housing for Americans, and  educating Americans. We do that, Mr. Speaker, because we value life. We  value these lives, and so we spend billions and billions of dollars  ensuring that there are opportunities for these folks, ensuring that we  are protecting these lives and we are doing everything we can to  provide a pathway to prosperity, to make sure that these people are  healed from their ailments, to make sure that they have shelter, and to  make sure that they have food.   Mr. Speaker, under current law, if someone causes a fetus to die,  that is a crime in this country. That is a crime. They can be charged  for the murder of the mother, and they can be charged for the murder of  the fetus.                                time  1945    But there is one exception in the law, and that is an abortion. I  don't understand how in this country we can, on the one hand, say that  these lives are so valuable and we are going to spend all these  resources on healthcare and many other issues in people's lives because  they have so much value to us as Americans. I don't understand how we  can charge someone criminally if a fetus is killed through some type of  crime, yet we provide an exemption or an exception for abortion. A life  is a life, is a life, is a life, is a life. It either has value or it  does not.   This month, as we have the 45th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, it is  amazing to think about 45 years. I think it is important that we  reflect upon all of those constituents who we have all met; all of  those Americans who are the product of a changed mind; the constituents  I have met who have told me that their mother, their father changed  their mind, and telling me about their lives and the contributions they  have made to our community, the contributions they have made to this  Nation. All lives have value.   In this Congress, we have passed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child  Protection Act. We passed the Conscience Protection Act. As other  Members have noted, this week we are going to be voting on the Born- Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which ensures that if a child  survives an abortion--that awful situation--they would be given  appropriate medical care to ensure that they have an opportunity at  life, to ensure that they have a chance, because lives have value.   Mr. Speaker, as we move forward, I want to continue working with  folks on both sides of the aisle, as I often hear people standing here  and saying they are a voice for the voiceless. They are a voice for  those that are vulnerable populations. This is a vulnerable population.  This is a voiceless life that we need to be representing and we need to  be fighting for.   I am going to continue working with folks on both sides of the aisle  to protect and promote life, the unborn and the born, because our  Nation's most vital resource isn't found in our economy, in our  environment, in our jobs. It is found in our people.   I think so many other policies that we pursue here in this Congress  respect that and represent that. This is the one anomaly that we need  to continue to fight to continue to fix, because a life has value. We  need to continue fighting for the most vulnerable in our society so  they have the opportunity to have the same experiences that other  Americans have.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  very eloquent remarks.  [[Page H467]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson), who  serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee. He has long pushed for  transparency and led a landmark effort on Federal payments to Federal  abortions providers. He recently led an amicus brief supporting his  State's right not to be forced to fund Planned Parenthood.
