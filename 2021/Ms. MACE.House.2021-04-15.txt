 Mr. Speaker, today I have the privilege to present  congratulatory remarks to the College of Charleston cheerleading team  on their historic weekend, winning their first national championship.   For the first time in school and program history, the College of  Charleston cheerleaders won first place, under the direction of their  head coach, Samantha Pairet, who stands as an exemplary leader of young  athletes in South Carolina and around the country.   The team traveled to Daytona April 7 through 10 to compete in the  Intermediate Small Coed Division I performance division, where they  received a score of 94.23 and were crowned the Intermediate Small Coed  Division I national champions. Way to go, Cougars.                            ____________________
