 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the  resolution that attempts to justify the sham impeachment process that I  have personally witnessed. The majority claims this resolution will  ensure a ``fair, open, and transparent process.''   Madam Speaker, do you want to know how fair this process is?   The resolution names the Financial Services Committee as part of the  investigation. Earlier this month, the chairwoman of that committee  said that President Trump should be ``placed in solitary confinement.''   Further, Republicans will only be allowed to subpoena witnesses with  Chairman Schiff's approval, as deemed necessary to the investigation.   If we have learned anything from the investigation so far, we know  the majority does not think due process is necessary. They don't even  think basic fairness is necessary.   A ``yes'' vote on this resolution today gives a stamp of approval to  a process that has been damaged beyond all repair and is a blatant and  obvious coup to unseat a sitting President of the United States. I will  not support a resolution that promises an open and fair process without  the basic, fundamental procedures necessary to ensure it.
